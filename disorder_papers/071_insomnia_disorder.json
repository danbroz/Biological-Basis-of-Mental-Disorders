      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequently the consequence of physiological and psychological problems and may be classified in three groups: diminished total quantity of sleep, loss of the quality and inadequate timing of the sleep process. It is considered that one third of the population has a sleep disturbance some time in the life. Insomnia is the most frequent sleep disturbance but timely and careful diagnostic procedure is fundamental for the specific treatment. Factors connected with the increased prevalence of sleep disturbance are female gender, presence of mental or somatic diseases and advanced age. Sleep disturbances are classified in four basic groups: insufficient quantity or unrestorative sleep (insomnia); prolonged sleep (excessive daily somnolence or hypersomnia); problems with timing of sleep and problems close to or within the sleep process (parasomnias).",

      "title": "[Clinical practice guideline. Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "title": "Insomnia – A Heterogenic Disorder Often Comorbid With Psychological and Somatic Disorders and Diseases: A Narrative Review With Focus on Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges",
      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician.

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is deﬁned as difﬁculty with the initiation, maintenance, duration, or quality of sleep resulting in the impairment of daytime functioning despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep (1,2). Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

      "title": "The challenge of sleep management in military operations.",
      "abstract": "It has long been known that short-term (days) insufficient sleep causes decrements in mental effectiveness that put individuals at increased risk of committing errors and causing accidents. More recently, it has been discovered that chronic poor sleep (over years) is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes (metabolic syndrome, obesity, degraded behavioral health). Implementing an effective sleep health program is, therefore, in the best interests of active duty personnel and their families both in the short- and long-term. Like managing physical activity or nutrition, effectively managing sleep health comes with its unique set of challenges arising from the fact that individuals who routinely do not obtain sufficient sleep are generally desensitized to feeling sleepy and are poor at judging their own performance capabilities--and individuals cannot be compelled to sleep. For these reasons, an optimally effective sleep health program requires 3 components: (1) a rigorous, evidence-based sleep education component to impart actionable knowledge about optimal sleep amounts, healthy sleep behaviors, the known benefits of sleep, the short- and long-term consequences of insufficient sleep, and to dispel myths about sleep; (2) a nonintrusive device that objectively and accurately measures sleep to empower the individual to track his/her own sleep/wake habits; and (3) a meaningful, actionable metric reflecting sleep/wake impact on daily effectiveness so that the individual sees the consequences of his/her sleep behavior and, therefore, can make informed sleep health choices.",

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical phenomena or behavior that develop during the sleep period. These abnormal events or experiences are not principally abnormalities of the states of sleep and wakefulness, and they are not generally associated with major complaints of excessive sleepiness or insomnia. Parasomnias can manifest as activation of skeletal muscles or the autonomic nervous system during sleep. They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness. Occasionally, parasomnias may give rise to violent and potentially injurious behavior. Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1. Disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors 2. Parasomnias usually associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, including REM sleep behavior disorder (including parasomnia overlap disorder and status dissociatus), recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorder 3.

      "title": "Daytime Drowsiness",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

      "abstract": "Several studies in the last ten years have been directed towards a better understanding of sleep disorders in childhood. Defining sleep disorders in this age is difficult in dependence of relevant differences in sleep patterns at subsequent developmental stages. In new-borns total sleep time is fairly equal during night and day. Normally, day-time sleep gradually decreases over the first three years of life, such that night-time sleep progressively increases till the age of four, and similar to adult sleep-time by adolescence. The most frequent sleep disorders observed in childhood are parasomnias, that, thought to be a CNS sign of immaturity, tend to be quite predictable, recurring in the same families and not even influenced by environmental stimuli. These disorders included: a) arousal disorders, that generally emerge from delta sleep or relate to arousals occurring during NREM sleep, very common in childhood and fairly common in adulthood either; b) somnambulism and somniloquy, that have many common characteristics: first of all, they have the potential to generate a great sense of discomfort and fear in parents watching a child who suddenly sits up in bed eyes-opened but 'unseeing'; c) nocturnal enuresis, that is substantially not a problem of depth of sleep, despite many parents believe. Although narcolepsy is more common in adolescence, many studies have demonstrated that narcoleptic symptoms may begin in childhood. Narcoleptic symptoms in children are similar in their appearance to those predominant in adults, but their expression may be different because of CNS maturational factors. Historical descriptions of the OSAS evidenced since the beginning the importance of neurobehavioral complications associated with the cessation of airflow at the nose and mouth accompanied by respiratory effort, deriving from upper airway obstruction which occurs during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Individuals who complain of insomnia report repeated difficulty with either initially falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia) or remaining asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep. Their sleep is described as short and inadequate, light and easily disrupted, of poor quality, unrefreshing, unsatisfactory, or nonrestorative. Frequent extended periods of wakefulness or persistent early morning awakenings may be reported. In children, insomnia may present as bedtime resistance or lack of ability to sleep independently. This sleep disturbance is associated with impairment of daytime function. Most investigators define insomnia as a sleep latency of 30 minutes or more; wake time after sleep onset of 30 minutes or more; sleep efficiency of less than 85%; or total sleep time less than 6 to 6.5 hours, occurring at least 3 nights a week. Patients with insomnia often report greater subjective sleep disturbance compared to objective polysomnographic parameters. The discrepancy between subjective estimates and objective measures of sleep is believed to be due to persistent sensory processing during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which decreases the ability of patients with insomnia to distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Perception of sleep appears to be altered. Persons with insomnia may have a greater tendency to describe, when awakened from sleep, of being awake all along, compared with those without insomnia. In addition, they may overestimate the duration of their sleep latencies.",

Although nighttime awakenings are common in the second half year and beyond, this is not a developmental necessity; rather, most normal infants gain the capacity to \"sleep through the night\" by 6 months of age. 2. There is not a single cause of (or a single treatment for) nighttime awakenings and crying; many factors may be responsible, and these must be identified and individually treated if there is to be resolution. 3. What are often perceived as abnormal awakenings are really only the normal awakenings associated with normal sleep stage cycling, and, parents' \"treatment\" of these awakenings with interventions, such as rocking or feeding, only make it more difficult for the child to go back to sleep without them after subsequent awakenings. 4. No evaluation of a sleepless child is complete without a thorough understanding of the child's daily schedule. The child's sleep schedule may be consistent and his sleep normal, and only the timing may be shifted from that desired by the parents. The bedtime difficulties or early morning awakenings generated in this setting may be handled inappropriately by the family, creating even more complicated problems. Or, the schedule may be irregular, sleep/wake rhythms may not adjust, and any of a variety of apparent sleep disorders may appear.",

Sleep disorders are divided into two general categories, dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias are disorders where there are problems falling asleep, staying asleep or of excessive sleepiness; they are characterized by irregularities in the timing, quantity and quality of sleep.

      "abstract": "In a general sense, insomnia suggests inadequate sleep quality or quantity when one has an adequate opportunity to sleep. When defined as a sleep disorder, insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep, which may represent problems with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening despite attempts to be sleeping. Sleep disorder nosologies also may include a complaint of nonrefreshing sleep as an insomnia complaint. For a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder to be made, daytime consequences or functional impairment also should be present. These may include fatigue, inability to concentrate, or irritability. Insomnia may be characterized as primary or comorbid (1). Primary insomnia occurs independently while comorbid insomnia presumably is associated with a sleep disturbance related to another disorder. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the general population at least occasionally and is a severe or chronic problem for about 10% of the population. Patients with co-occurring conditions have significantly increased risk for insomnia (2). People suffering with insomnia have increased healthcare costs and utilize health resources to a greater extent. They also have worse scores on quality-of-life measures. Persistent insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for the development or exacerbation of certain psychiatric and medical conditions. Overall, insomnia represents a significant socioeconomic burden both for individuals and for society.

Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a complex condition in which patients experience difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening. Chronic insomnia is defined as dissatisfying sleep quality or quantity, occurring at least three times per week, that has persisted for at least three months. Insomnia is common, with a higher incidence in certain subpopulations, including older adults (≥65 years of age) and patients with psychiatric and physical comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and alcohol or substance use disorders. Individuals experiencing insomnia often have disrupted sleep architecture, with polysomnography showing reduced time spent in the rejuvenating slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. As such, insomnia can seriously impair daytime functioning, cognition, and quality of life. Further, insomnia may result in a higher risk of various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, though the association between insomnia and these comorbidities is likely bi-directional. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the diagnosis is often missed or trivialized in medical practice. Given the profound impact of chronic insomnia, a proactive diagnosis and successful treatment is essential. The primary non-pharmacologic treatment option available for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on sleep hygiene techniques, sleep restriction, circadian rhythm therapy, and cognitive therapy. Although CBT-I is the first-line treatment for insomnia and should always be recommended, it may not always be available in a timely manner, it can be costly and not every patient can afford it, some patients choose to opt out, and may not be sufficient as a single therapy approach. Thus, in many cases, pharmacotherapy may be needed in addition to or instead of CBT-I to treat insomnia and improve daytime functioning and associated cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Of note, patients also often self-medicate with over-the-counter medications, including cannabis products. Currently, commonly prescribed medications for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs; e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam) and Z-drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone).10 In addition, despite their risks, antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have also been used to treat insomnia despite being off-label and promoting sleep indirectly.",

Delirium is a constellation of signs and symptoms that definitively indicate the presence of an underlying physical disorder. Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

Diagnostic procedure for insomnia should include evaluation of sleep–wake behaviour and sleep history, as well as questions about somatic and mental disorders, anamnesis of medication and other substances used, physical examination, sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, and additional measures. Sleep diaries or actigraphy can be used to evaluate sleep–wake schedules or circadian rhythm disorders. Polysomnography is recommended when other sleep disorders (periodic limb movement disorder, sleep apnea or narcolepsy) are suspected, also for treatment-resistant insomnia. Cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age. A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy is not effective or not available. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia. Long-term treatment of insomnia with benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists is not recommended. Sedating antidepressants are effective for short-term insomnia treatment. Antihistaminics and antipsychotics are not recommended for insomnia treatment because of insufficient evidence. Melatonin is not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of low efficacy. Phytotherapeutics are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence. Light therapy and exercise regimes may be useful as adjunct therapies. Acupuncture, aromatherapy, foot reflexology, homeopathy, meditative movement, moxibustion, and yoga are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence.",

This occurs despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep to occur and is associated with impairment of daytime function. Patients with insomnia may describe frequent extended periods of wakefulness during the sleep period or persistent morning awakenings that are earlier than desired (terminal insomnia). Insomnia can be divided on the basis of its duration into transient or short-term (lasting only a few days to three to four weeks) or chronic (persisting for more than one to three months).

      "abstract": "There seems to be a lack of understanding between practitioners and patients on the topic of insomnia. One adult out of four complains of insomnia; however only one insomniac out of four has ever complained about it to their practitioner during a visit made for another problem and only one out of twenty has come to discuss specifically the problem of his or her insomnia. Only a few patients with insomnia take a treatment for it. This gap between the patient's feeling and the practitioner's answer has to be better understood if we want to know why insomnia seems to be so prevalent and what impact it has on society. One aspect may be a question of definition. Insomnia may be considered an ordinary complaint (after one poor night) or as a chronic disease. Practitioners have poor knowledge about sleep disorders and may be embarrassed about coping with an impairment they never specifically learned to manage. The second aspect concerns the impact of insomnia on daytime alertness and performance. While patients usually complain of an impaired daytime functioning with a feeling of fatigue, sleepiness, and risk of mistakes, many studies of insomniacs do not reveal any increased sleepiness or decrease of performance (measured by objective tests) the day following a poor night. Practitioners may therefore find it difficult to understand the real impact of insomnia on daytime functioning. The third aspect is related to the large co-morbidity between insomnia and psychiatric diseases, especially depression and anxiety. It does make it harder for practitioners to define whether the sleep impairment suffered by their patient is the cause for other symptoms or the consequence of an underlying disease. Thus, it makes it all the more difficult for the practitioner to determine which treatment is the most appropriate. These aspects have to be clarified if one wants to estimate the real impact of insomnia on society. It could be useful to both practitioners and patients to have a better understanding on the relationship between poor sleep and daily lives.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

Insomnia has been defined as both a symptom and a disorder, and is characterized as sleep that is chronically unrestorative or poor in quality often due to difficulty in initiating sleep, in maintaining sleep, or with waking up too early. Insomnia results in some form of daytime impairment in the patient's normal activites. Although the exact pathophysiology of insomnia is poorly understood, it is often believed to arise from a state of hyperarousal in multiple neurophysiological and/or psychological systems. Population-based studies suggest that while about one-third of the general population complains of sleep disturbance, only 10-15 percent has associated symptoms of daytime functional impairment, and even fewer, only 6-10 percent have impairments sufficient for the diagnostic criteria of insomnia. The cornerstone of the insomnia evaluation and diagnosis is a comprehensive history obtained by the clinical interview with patient and/or family. Additional assessment tools, such as sleep diary or log, various questionnaires, actigraphy, and multichannel polysomnography (PSG) have been used as an aid to diagnosis, although many are limited in their validation. Insomnia causes a significant burden of medical, psychiatric, societal consequences on the individual and societal level.

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION In a general sense, the operational definition of insomnia in children may be construed as similar to that in adults, i.e., significant difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep and/or non-restorative sleep (early morning awakening is an infrequent complaint in children). However, practically speaking, the most frequent clinical manifestations of childhood insomnia, particularly in younger children, are bedtime refusal or resistance, delayed sleep onset, and/or prolonged night wakings requiring parental intervention. It is estimated that overall 20% to 30% of children in cross-sectional studies are reported to have some significant bedtime problems and/or night wakings (1-7), and a recent study suggests that lifetime prevalence of insomnia in 13 to 16-year-old adolescents approaches 11% (8). These percentages are substantially higher in children with psychiatric comorbidities (9,10) and with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders (11). Furthermore, there is clear evidence from both experimental laboratory-based studies and clinical observations that insufficient and poor quality sleep in children results in or exacerbates mood instability and behavioral dysregulation, impacts negatively on neurocognitive functions and academic performance (12-14), and affects caregivers, with significant repercussions on family functioning. Therefore, appropriate and effective management of insomnia in the pediatric population is an important therapeutic goal for mental healthcare providers.",

Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

      "abstract": "The most frequent of sleep disorders in children are repeated and prolonged wakeful periods. One month old infants are normally awake during one-third of the nocturnal sleeping time. Gradually, sleep moves into night and wakefulness into daytime. At 3 years, 25 to 38% of children wake up during the night, but after 5 years this proportion becomes negligible. Apart from acute or chronic diseases which may produce sleep disorders, most of these are due to environmental factors. Two syndrome are worthy of special mention: deficiency of slow wave and deep sleep in psychosocial dwarfism, and insomnia due to intolerance to cow's milk. Treatment of insomniac children rests on behavioural techniques: parents must be helped to understand and observe the sleep-wake rhythm of their children and teach them to acquire regular sleeping habits.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep-related complaint and the second most common overall complaint (after pain) reported in primary care settings. It affects 35% of the general population, according to the 1984 report of the National Institutes of Mental Health (1). Insomnia is not defined by total sleep time but by the inability to obtain sleep of sufficient length or quality to produce refreshment the following morning. For example, a person who needs only 4 hours of sleep does not have insomnia if he or she is refreshed in the morning after having 4 hours of sleep, whereas someone who needs 10 hours of sleep may have insomnia if he or she does not feel refreshed even after 8 hours of sleep. Contrary to popular lore, psychiatric or psychological factors are not the most frequent causes of insomnia. Insomnias can be divided into two major categories: the primary insomnias and the secondary insomnias. As discussed elsewhere in this volume, primary insomnias are conditions in which the insomnia is the main pathophysiological process, whereas secondary insomnias are conditions where the insomnia is a symptom of another disorder.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in pregnancy: Why and how should we manage them?",
      "abstract": "Maternal sleep quality worsens during pregnancy, already from the first trimester on and especially in the third trimester.1, 2 Nevertheless, the sleep quality is often ignored by both physicians as well as by women themselves as sleep quality is generally assumed to improve after delivery. However, sleep disturbances may continue during postpartum period or even become chronic. The most important sleep disturbances during pregnancy are primary insomnia, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome (RLS).2, 3 Sleep disturbances typically cause sleep fragmentation and deterioration of sleep architecture leading to sleep loss and daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue, cognitive difficulties and increase risk for accidents.2, 3 The algorithm of the diagnose and treatments of the most important sleep disturbances in pregnancy is illustrated in Figure 1. Primary insomnia includes both initiation insomnia, which shows as difficulties to fall asleep, and maintenance insomnia, which includes nightly awakenings and too early morning awakenings (being unable to fall asleep again). The etiology of primary insomnia during pregnancy is multifactorial, and might be associated with physical (hyperemesis, nocturia, joint and back pain, heartburn, nasal congestion, thermoregulatory problems, contractions, fetal movements, uncomfortable or unusual sleeping positions, dreams and nightmares) and mental (especially depression and anxiety) causes. Poor sleep quality has shown to be associated with the increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, prolonged labor and increased risk of cesarean section.2, 3 Constant snoring is a typical feature of SDB, which includes sleep apnea and partial upper airway obstruction. In pregnant women, SDB is often caused by partial upper airway obstruction rather than of episodes of frank obstructive apnea.2 Gestational weight gain and estrogen-induced hyperemia, mucosal edema and mucus hypersecretion lead to the narrowing of upper airways exacerbating the risk for SDB. However, progesterone-induced stimulation of breathing, sleeping in lateral position, and decrease in the duration of rapid eye movement sleep (during which breathing is more unstable) may protect against SDB. Furthermore, micrognatia and loose throat and larynx are important risk factors for SDB. In addition to snoring, other typical symptoms are headache and dry month in the morning and daytime sleepiness (most typically irresistible falling asleep when inactive). SDB has shown to be in association with increased risk for gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, cesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.2, 4 RLS is a nocturnal neurosensory movement disorder, which is connected with dopaminergic dysfunction. Although the etiology is still unclear, RLS may be idiopathic, genetic, or linked to various disorders, especially iron deficiency. RLS is characterized by unpleasant irritation, creeping, crawling, burning, pins-and-needles or itching sensations, most commonly in the legs. The sensations occur at rest and worsen towards the evening and night. Also smoking, use of caffeine, some medications or alcohol may initiate or exacerbate the symptoms. Transient RLS in previous pregnancies is associated with an elevated risk of new transient symptoms in future pregnancies, as well as with an increased risk for future development of chronic idiopathic RLS.2, 5 An association between RLS and hypertensive pregnancy disorders has been shown.2 Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are known risk factors for anxiety/depression both during pregnancy and postpartum period.1, 2, 6 Sleep disturbances often herald mood disturbances, and pregnant and postpartum women with mood symptoms typically suffer from sleep disturbances, especially from primary insomnia which may increase recurrence of a preexisting mental illness.6 Detection of the origin of the symptoms is the crucial first step in the management of maternal sleep disturbances. For the diagnosis of primary insomnia, questionnaires are feasible and sufficiently adequate tools in clinical practice. Because of the mismatch between subjective symptoms and objectively measured sleep quality, polysomnography, which measures sleep stages, is rarely needed.2 Of note is, that the patient may express having \"worse sleep quality\" or \"insomnia symptoms\", which may not stem from primary insomnia, but are secondary for instance for SDB (maintenance insomnia), RLS (initiation insomnia) or mental symptoms (initiation and maintenance insomnia). If SDB is suspected, ambulatory sleep polygraphy, which measures breathing and blood oxygen level is nessessary.2 In RLS, type and occurrence time of the symptoms and relief of the symptoms by movement, such as walking or stretching the limbs, are diagnostic. As iron deficiency may induce RLS, measurement of serum hemoglobin and ferritin (+C-reactive protein) is essential.5 To detect mental problems, especially depression and anxiety, structural questionnaires can be used.2 Good sleep hygiene is the basis of the treatment of all sleep disturbances. It includes convenient temperature in bedroom, reduced late fluid intake to prevent nocturia, suitable diet in case of gastro-esophageal reflux, massage in case of muscular pain and use of comfortable mattress and pillows. For primary insomnia non-pharmacologic treatments, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, is recommended and effective. It can be carried out as individual or group therapy. Additionally, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness, and exercise are safe and effective. In case of severe or persistent insomnia, a short-term use of sedatives (including sedative antihistamines), sleeping pills (especially benzodiazepine–like drugs) or low dose antidepressants (with sedative properties) can be prescribed after risks and benefits consideration. However, all these drugs pass the placenta and although no teratogenic effects has been shown, they may be harmful for fetus and new-born. A long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills should not be offered, since they often leads to noxious effects, like deterioration of sleep architecture and dependence on medication. Melatonin or herbal preparations, like valerian, are not recommended for treatment of insomnia during pregnancy or lactation because of the lack of safety and efficacy data. In cases of insomnia due to aggravating of mood symptoms, antidepressants, especially serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be warranted.2 The gold standard treatment for SDB is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and it is shown to be safe and effective also during pregnancy. After the diagnosis of SDB, CPAP treatment should be initiated without a delay. Positional treatment, especially lateral sleep posture, is recommendable. In general rule, surgical procedures should not be performed during pregnancy for the treatment of SDB. Local nasal congestive and corticosteroid treatments reduce nasal mucosal edema and thus improve nasal ventilation. In addition, treating respiratory infections effectively and gastro-esophageal reflux with tilted position of the upper body while in bed or proton-pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are also important.2 For the treatment of RLS, per oral iron supplementation (accompanied with C-vitamin for better iron absorption; serum ferritin level <75 μg/L) is recommended. However, in severe RLS (and with serum ferritin level <30 μg/L), oral iron is often insufficient or has a too slow effect and thus intravenous iron, safe also during pregnancy, may be needed. In addition, folate supplementation is favorable for RLS and it is also advisable during the periconception and early pregnancy period for fetal development. In addition, the use of magnesium may be beneficial, although the efficacy data is insufficient. Furthermore, relaxation procedures, walking, stretching, massage, use of compression stockings while sleeping or a warm bath before going to bed may also relieve the symptoms. In severe cases, pramipexole, levodopamin/carbidopamin, opioids, bensodiazepins or gabapentin beyond the first trimester may be needed under a consultation of a neurologist, with the lowest efficient dose, although all these medications may induce risks and side-effects for fetus and new-born.2, 5 Although sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, the sleep quality is not systematically assessed during pregnancy follow-ups. Furthermore, the research evaluating the reasons and consequences of maternal sleep disturbances and the safety and efficacy of the treatments are scant. Good sleep quality is, nevertheless, essential for good quality of life and good health state and thus additional research in the field is indispensable.",

Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one.

The main differential diagnosis of parasomnias are the nocturnal epilepsies, which may require video electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment if suspected. Night terrors The child will appear afraid, inconsolable, and often moaning or whimpering repetitively. They will usually be either unresponsive or only partially responsive to attempts to intervene or communicate. Characteristically, the child will remember nothing of the event in the morning.

      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "title": "[Management of infantile colics].",
      "abstract": "Infantile colic concerns about 10-30% of all newborns and has been defined as a condition characterized by paroxysmal episodes of unexplained full force crying for at least three days a week and continuing for one week or more in a thriving well-nourished infant. The disorder more likely occurs in the evening, without identifiable causes and resolves spontaneously by the fourth month of life. The several factors involved in the etiopathogenesis (food intolerance or allergy to cow's milk protein, intolerance to lactose, intestinal hyperperistalsis, neuro-hormonal immaturity, maternal anxiety and familial stress), make the management of infants with colics difficult. We propose a scoring system for the evaluation of colics in infants based on: 1) crying intensity and duration; 2) accompanying characteristics of crises (e.g. meteorism, family history for allergic disease, type of feeding, type of stools); 3) evaluation of parents' opinion of their infants' crying. Type of management is based on the score: a) crying that is unrelated to colics: treatments referred to specific diagnosis. b) crying that is related to colics but not severe: first and second step of management; c) crying that is related to colics and is severe: third step of management.first step: pacifier, rocking, dull continuous background noise, hot water bottle on the abdomen, herbal tea, simethicone. Second step: pharmacological treatment and periodic controls. Pharmacological treatment include antispastic drugs (e.g. cimetropium bromide). Third step: dietary modification and/or pharmacological treatment: mothers of breast-fed infants are given a diet with no milk or products containing its proteins, or fish, or eggs. Infants who are not breast-fed receive soy milk and if symptoms continue soy milk is substituted with hydrolyzed casein milk formula. Pharmacological treatment include antispastic drugs (e.g. cimetropium bromide and in non responders dicyclomine hydrochloride). Dietary modifications appear more suitable than pharmacological treatment in resolving symptoms, since side effects of drugs have been described and our recent results indicate appropriate dietary modifications offer better results than pharmacological treatment in resolving crises. However, before interrupting dietary modifications and reintroducing cow's milk proteins, infant's tolerance to such proteins is tested. In any case because of the good prognosis and rapid regression of symptoms, dietary regimens or pharmacological treatment should only be applied if really necessary and for brief periods under medical supervision.",

It is a fairly common problem in paediatric age: approximately 1 child out of 5 is affected at 5 years of age, with a potential significant impact on their quality of life and family. Pathogenesis is multifactorial, resulting in a combination of genetic factors, delayed maturation of the central nervous system, night-time anti-diuretic hormone deficiency and, in case, coexisting conditions such as sleep and behavioural disorders. Adequate diagnosis and management can speed up resolution, which usually occurs spontaneously, and identify those cases underlying an organic cause. Diagnosis is clinical. Instrumental investigation (such as ultrasound or urodynamic tests) is reserved to selected cases. Treatment mainly involves behavioural approach alongside, in those in which this approach fails, nocturnal alarm and/or pharmacological therapy. Assessment of associated comorbidities is crucial (ex. constipation, sleep and behavioural disorders).",

      "abstract": "Schedule-dependent sleep problems tend to increase as the youngster moves from middle childhood through preadolescence and into adolescence. This is partly because the youngster becomes more independent and parental control over both the selection of particular sleep schedules and the consistent maintenance of these schedules across weekends diminishes. Even accurate descriptions of the existing problem may become difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, specific syndromes are common and may be identified and treated. There may be increased demands at both ends of the sleep period leading to later bedtimes, earlier wakings, insufficient sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Periods of wakefulness confined to one portion of the night (beginning, middle, or end) may occur if sleep requirements are overestimated. Insomnia coupled with trouble waking may imply a circadian phase shift abnormality or a 'school-refusal' variant. And, variable sleep difficulties may be seen in a youngster with irregular schedules and poor sleep hygiene. Guidelines to the understanding, evaluation, and treatment of these syndromes are presented.",

      "title": "[Nighttime eating disorders--clinical symptoms and treatment].",
      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a prevalent sleep problem, affecting approximately one-third of the children in the general population. Despite its high prevalence, paediatric insomnia is often unrecognized and untreated in clinical practice. It is commonly associated with other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric comorbidities, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). If left untreated, paediatric insomnia may be linked to a constellation of negative impacts in the affected child, including an increased risk of health-related problems (e.g., obesity/overweight, pain, fatigue), psychological issues (e.g., anxiety, depression), interpersonal problems (e.g., poor family relationships, peer problems) and impaired daytime functioning (e.g., poor alertness, impaired school performance), as well as elevated levels of family stress and impaired parental mental health and quality of life. Several factors may contribute to paediatric insomnia, including genetic influence, hyperarousal and hypersensitivity, circadian issues, poor sleep hygiene, comorbid medical conditions, and psychosocial and behavioural factors. A thorough assessment is essential to inform the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents. Actigraphy can provide a continuous and objective estimation of sleep-wake patterns, and is a useful tool in the assessment of paediatric insomnia. Behavioural interventions are usually recommended as the first-line treatment and there has been limited evidence to support the efficacy and safety of medications for treating paediatric insomnia. The current chapter provides an overview of paediatric insomnia, including the classification and diagnostic criteria, prevalence, consequences, and factors associated with childhood insomnia, as well as its assessment and management.",

      "title": "Therapeutic effectiveness and patient acceptance of a vestibular nerve activation intervention in chronic insomnia",
      "abstract": "Defined as: “Complaints of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep”, insomnia is one of the most common presenting symptoms in the primary care setting [1, 2]. The disturbance may consist of one or more of three features:• difficulty in initiating sleep• difficulty in maintaining sleep• waking up too early [3].Insomnia can have a serious impact on work performance and maintaining healthy social relationships [4]. Chronic insomnia is differentiated from acute insomnia by individuals experiencing at least one of the symptoms described above for a minimum of 30 days [3]. Predictably, there has been a wealth of research in the areas of assessment and treatment for this sleep disorder, given the impact insomnia has been shown to have on mental and physical health and wellbeing [3-5]. Incidence rates are routinely around 9% of the general population, escalating to 30% for those who report occasional suffering [6]. Many individuals continue to report symptoms of insomnia for many years after initial onset [7]. Areas of particular interest to clinicians, health-care professionals and insomnia sufferers include implementation, acceptance and adherence to therapies that provide effective long-term management. Conventional treatments include prescription medications (sedative-hypnotics), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other alternative therapies (e.g. alcohol, herbal remedies and off-label use of other medicines) [3]. While sedative-hypnotics and CBT have been shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia [3,8], expert opinion counsels against long-term use of sedative-hypnotics due to residual sedation, rebound insomnia, memory impairment, dependency and withdrawal difficulties [9, 10]. In addition, CBT is not easily accessed and patients frequently have difficulty adhering to the strict behavioral program that is typically prescribed [11]. A further area of concern is the limited evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of alternative therapies, despite their widespread use [3].One promising approach to managing chronic insomnia is non-invasive mechanical vestibular nerve stimulation, which has been demonstrated to affect sleep [12-17]. The vestibular apparatus, in conjunction with visual and proprioceptive inputs, is responsible for maintaining balance under all conditions. Previous studies have used a mechanical rocking motion to induce vestibular activation, mimicking the sensation of infants being comforted by their parents. Improvements in sleep architecture and increased Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency, Rapid Eye Movement and decreased Sleep Onset Latency have been demonstrated when using this technique [12-17]. A unique therapy, designed to non-invasively stimulate the vestibular nerve to promote sleep onset, has recently been developed. As an alternative to the rocking motion delivered by mechanical action, a swaying sensation is artificially created through mild electrical stimulation. Clinical studies have been previously conducted to investigate both the safety and efficacy of this medical device for the treatment of insomnia via a transient insomnia model, with positive outcomes [18, 19]. Individuals with chronic insomnia report similar issues in sleep disturbance to those in transient insomnia, but persistent in nature. Given the limitations of current effective therapies, and the recent emphasis on patient-centered care [20], there is an increasing need for an alternative treatment for insomnia symptoms. It has been shown that patient preference for non-pharmacological treatment was over three times greater than prescription medications [21]. Thus many would prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach if an effective one were available [11]. Vestibular nerve activation may provide such a treatment for chronic insomnia.",

      "title": "Stay Awake! Understanding, Diagnosing, and Successfully Managing Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. (1) When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. (2) Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. (3,4) In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. (5) The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; TABLE 1). (6,7) Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness (FIGURE 1). This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed. Overview of narcolepsy Narcolepsy is a chronic, neurologic sleep disorder that results from the dysregulation of sleep-wake cycles. (8,9) Its 4 classic symptoms are EDS, cataplexy (a sudden drop in muscle tone that is triggered by emotional factors), sleep paralysis (a generalized flaccid paralysis that happens slightly before or at the time of falling asleep or on awakening), and hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations that occur while falling asleep). (8,10,11) EDS is the symptom that is experienced by almost all patients with narcolepsy. (10) Cataplexy is present in about 70% of patients with narcolepsy, whereas sleep paralysis (30% to 50%) and hypnagogic hallucinations (20% to 40%) are experienced less often; all 4 symptoms are present in an estimated 11% to 14% of patients with narcolepsy. (11) Although the origins of narcolepsy are still not well known, clinical understanding of the neurologic dysfunction that underlies narcolepsy as well as treatment options have increased markedly in the last decade. Prevalence and risk factors According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, narcolepsy is the third most frequently diagnosed primary sleep disorder found in patients who seek treatment at sleep clinics, after obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. (8) Narcolepsy appears throughout the world in every racial and ethnic group, but prevalence rates vary. (8,12) Reports in the United States estimate a prevalence of 1 per 2000 population, whereas the prevalence in Japan is considerably higher (about 1 per 600 population) and in Israel it is much lower (about 1 per 500,000 population). (8,9,11,12) Its incidence has been estimated to be about 0.74 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with cataplexy, and 1.37 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. (13) Although narcolepsy is about as common as multiple sclerosis, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated (8,12); the delay between the emergence of the initial symptoms and diagnosis is usually more than 10 years. (14) [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] The initiating event for narcolepsy is not well understood, but infection, immune system dysfunction, trauma, hormonal changes, or stress may be present before narcoleptic symptoms become manifest. …",

      "abstract": "A group of insomniacs whose only sleep-stage abnormality was prolonged sleep latency was identified. Prior to sleep onset, these subjects had significantly higher levels of physiological activity than did normal sleepers. With the approach of sleep onset, these differences diminished. No group differences in presleep cognitive activity were found. Insomniacs had significantly higher Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores than normal on scales indicating neuroticism, anxiety, and worry (derived from the Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales). Although sleep-onset insomnia is accompanied by psychological disturbance and heightened physiological activity, it is unlikely that either factor alone is sufficient to cause it. Excessive rumination may be an epiphenomenon of sleeplessness. Chronic insomnia is a distressing complaint that affects millions of persons (Solomon, 1979). Three general types of insomnia have been described: initial, or sleep-onset; intermittent, or sleep-maintenance; and terminal, or early morning awakening (Kleitman, 1963). The present investigation is concerned with primary idiopathic sleep-onset insomnia: the inability to fall asleep in the absence of identifiable physiological or psychological determinants. Many theories have been advanced to explain idiopathic insomnia (Rechtschaffen & Monroe, 1969). Two of the most popular suggest that insomniacs are either physiologically or cognitively hyperaroused relative to normal (Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, 1979; Borkovec, 1979). Support for the first hypothesis has rested largely on a study by Monroe (1967), demonstrating that self-defined poor sleepers had higher levels of physiological activity than good",

This risk exists in a wide range of collectively very common sleep disorders which need to be considered in explaining insomnia, excessive sleepiness or disturbed episodes of behaviour associated with sleep (parasomnias). Examples given include circadian sleep–wake cycle disorders (such as the delayed sleep phase syndrome), obstructive sleep apnoea, narcolepsy, Kleine–Levin syndrome, sleep paralysis and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder.

Insomnia or Nidranasha, is not just about being not getting proper sleep but it means that the nervous system has been weakened and reduces our ability to cope up with daily sleep. Insomnia is named as Nidranasha, happens due to vitiation of Kapha, Pitta and Vata dosha. Proper and deep sleep helps the person keep Energetic, Enthusiastic, does Brumhana, increases the Bala, increases vigour and vitality and most it keeps the Mind in stable state for gaining knowledge. Insomnia means inability to get sleep at night or inability to have a restful and sound sleep. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Arthritis, menopause, and certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Treatment of Insomnia:- Panchakarma â€“ Taila dhara a type of Shirodhara is very much useful in combacting the Insomnia caused due to various above said disorders. So its a demand of time to know about the real sleep and the disturbed sleep according to Ayurveda and Mordern medicines also and effect of Taila Dhara Brahmi,Jatamamsi siddha) in treating Insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Disorders of sleep belong to the most frequent troubles. A lot of different factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of sleep disorders. Modern sleep research has opened important views into the structure of sleep and the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. In a narrower sense sleep disorders mean a deficiency of sleep (hyposomnia). This may concern the induction of sleep or its maintenance. Sleep disorders without underlying disease may be differentiated from those caused by different diseases. Hypersomnia may occur as a symptom of various cerebral dysfunctions and processes, as an episodic disorder (Kleine-Levin-syndrome) or as a part of the Pickwick-syndrome. In narcolepsy characteristic symptoms are sleep attacks, kataplexy (emotionally induced loss of muscle tone) and transient pareses during awakening. Disturbances linked with sleep are snoring, somnambulism, speaking and grinding of the teeth during sleep and nocturnal enuresis. They may constitute idiopathic disorders. On the other hand, there may be similarities between epileptic phenomena and these disorders. Some epilepsies demonstrate relations to the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness which become evident in the manifestation of seizures and epileptiform EEG activity at certain stages of vigilance.",

Insomnia symptoms include sleep problems (initiating or maintaining sleep) as well their repercussions on wake-time functioning. Insomnia Disorder can be diagnosed when insomnia symptoms are recurrent (>3 times a week), persistent (> 3 months), cannot be attributed to sleep-disrupting circumstances, and impair daytime functioning. Insomnia Disorder affects approximately 10% of the population and tends to persist over months or years. Insomnia Disorder severely reduces the quality of life and carries an increased risk of severe, long-lasting health problems, including cardiovascular and mood disorders. Given its high prevalence, persistence and impact on health, it is highly important to study the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder during wakefulness and sleep. Overall, the study of the endogenous EEG dynamics in Insomnia Disorder revealed that hyperarousal of the central nervous system occurs not only during sleep but also during wakefulness. During wakefulness, Insomnia Disorder is characterized by stronger cortical oscillations in a broad beta band and by increased cortical sensitivity to cardiac activity. Furthermore, people with more severe insomnia complaints show stronger Long-Range Temporal Correlations of the amplitude fluctuations of cortical oscillations; which is consistent with a weaker inhibitory bias in the cortical balance between excitation and inhibition. During sleep, the shallow and more fragmented sleep that characterizes Insomnia Disorder may particularly involve N2 instability. Resolving the causal relationship between sleep fragmentation and excitation/inhibition balance is the next key-step in the understanding of the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder.",

The boundaries between waking and REM sleep become blurred resulting in REM phenomena in wakefulness and features of wakefulness during sleep. Narcolepsy is not rare, with a prevalence of 25–50/100,000 in Western Europe, however many individuals remain undiagnosed for many years after the onset of symptoms [1]. One third of adults with narcolepsy describe their first symptoms appearing before the age of 15 and there is a clear peak of onset in the teenage years [2]. The classic narcolepsy tetrad comprised excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotion, most frequently laughter), sleep paralysis and hypnagogic (on falling asleep) and hypnopompic (on waking) hallucinations. Disturbed nighttime sleep was often added to make up a pentad. These symptoms apart from excessive daytime sleep and cataplexy are not uncommon in unaffected individuals and other sleep disorders. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders defines narcolepsy without cataplexy as excessive daytime sleepiness and multiple sleep onset REM periods on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) [3].

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

Primary insomniacs have a good response to hypnotics, but feel out of control if they use them continuously. Two components are involved in maintaining the insomnia - a psychological anxiety and a physiological response to this anxiety, including raised muscle tone and respiratory rate. A behavioural regimen based on a cognitive-behavioural approach designed to improve sleep quality gradually over a period of 4 - 6 weeks is often helpful. A hypnotic can be prescribed for use every third night during this regimen - zolpidem and zopiclone are preferred. Referral to a sleep specialist may be necessary if this approach does not work.",

The consequences of insomnia, if left untreated, may contribute to the risks of developing additional serious conditions, such as psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic issues. Furthermore, some comorbidities associated with insomnia may be bidirectional in their causality because psychiatric and other medical problems can increase the risk for insomnia. Regardless of the serious consequences of inadequately treated insomnia, clinicians often do not inquire into their patients' sleep habits, and patients, in turn, are not forthcoming with details of their sleep difficulties. The continuing education of physicians and patients with regard to insomnia and currently available therapies for the treatment of insomnia is, therefore, essential. Insomnia may present as either a difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking too early without being able to return to sleep. Furthermore, these symptoms often change over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, when considering a sleep medication, one with efficacy for the treatment of multiple insomnia symptoms is recommended. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release, has been approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by both difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Here, we review studies supporting the use of zolpidem extended-release in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties.",

Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It is common in mental health care to ask about people’s days but comparatively rare to ask about their nights. Most patients diagnosed with schizophrenia struggle at nighttime. The next-day effects can include a worsening of psychotic experiences, affective disturbances, and inactivity, which in turn affect the next night’s sleep. Objective and subjective cognitive abilities may be affected too. Patients commonly experience a mix of sleep difficulties in a night and across a week. These difficulties include trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping at all; nightmares and other awakenings; poor-quality sleep; oversleeping; tiredness; sleeping at the wrong times; and problems establishing a regular sleep pattern. The patient group is also more vulnerable to obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. We describe in this article how the complex presentation of non-respiratory sleep difficulties arises from variation across five factors: timing, mental state, need for sleep, self-care, and environment. We set out 10 illustrative patterns of such difficulties experienced by patients with non-affective psychosis. These sleep problems are eminently treatable with intensive psychological therapy delivered over approximately eight sessions. We describe key techniques and their typical order of implementation by presentation. Sleep problems are an important issue for patients. Giving them the therapeutic attention patients often desire brings both real clinical benefits and improves views of services. Treatment is also very likely to lessen psychotic experiences and mood disturbances while improving daytime functioning and quality of life. Tackling sleep difficulties can be a route toward the successful treatment of psychosis.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "title": "Evaluating and Managing Insomnia: Non-pharmacological Treatments",
      "abstract": "For about 40% of Americans, Insomnia is a major health issue that often leads to fatigue, reduced immunity, and dangerous driving. A good night sleep is essential for functioning and performance. It also influences mood, cognition, concentration, fatigue, and healing. Insomnia may be related to medical and psychiatric disorders, shift work, stimulants, travel, anxiety, pain, and other problems (e.g., poor sleep environment). People with insomnia (e.g., difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings and daytime drowsiness) tend to rely on alcohol, drugs, and other remedies. Insomnia may reflect sleep apnea or other medical or mental health disorders that require evaluation as well as poor sleep hygiene. Insomnia can be brief, episodic or chronic. Unfortunately, many people assume that insomnia is normal and do not report it to the nurse or seek treatment. Sleep deprivation impairs the person's physical, mental, and cardiac functioning. Often insomnia is treated with medications which may have side effectives or be habit forming. Individuals with insomnia need evaluation of the precipitants of insomnia, education about sleep hygiene, and information about non-pharmacological treatments. In clinic and hospital settings, nurses are in a pivotal position to identify sleep problems, educate patients, and refer them for follow up.",

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are an important aspect of geriatric psychiatry. In the United States, more than half of noninstitutionalized individuals age 65 years and older report chronic sleep difficulties (Foley et al. 1995; \"National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement\" 1991; Prinz et al. 1990). These problems affect quality of life, increase the risk of accidents and falls, and may lead to long-term-care placement (Pollak and Perlick 1991; Pollak et al. 1990; Sanford 1975). Working effectively with elderly individuals requires expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) includes eight general sleep disorders categories: insomnia disorder, hypersomolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, restless legs syndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Patients with these conditions generally complain about some aspect of their sleep and/or waking function. For some patients, the sleep-focused concerns pertain to the quality, timing, amounts, or discontinuity in their sleep. For other patients, primary complaints may focus more on daytime sleepiness or impairment. For a subset of patients, complaints may focus on unusual behaviors occurring in sleep. In this chapter we consider those sleep-wake disorders most commonly encountered in geriatric psychiatry. Among these are those insomnia disorders involving a difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime impairment or distress, as well as those that present as disorders of excessive daytime somnolence characterized by persistent daytime sleepiness that causes significant distress or impairment in function (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The most important disorders of excessive sleepiness are sleep ap-nea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and narcolepsy. Circadian rhythm disorders manifest as a misalignment between an indi-vidual's sleep-wake cycle and the pattern that is desired or required (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The circadian rhythm is important for function because it is a cycle not only of sleep and wakefulness but also of many physiological processes and phe-nomena, including body temperature, alertness, cognitive performance, and hormone release (Czeisler et al. 1990; Folkard and Totterdell 1994; Minors et al. 1994).",

The arousal disorders, common in children, are usually benign and disappear by puberty. Sleep-wake transition disorders such as sleep starts are benign as well, and may occur at any age. The parasomnias comprise different entities such as nightmares, REM-sleep behavior disorder, sleep enuresis, and bruxism. Diagnosis and treatment often require a multidisciplinary approach. Virtually every psychiatric, neurologic, or medical disease, when of sufficient severity, leaves its specific fingerprint on sleep; some disorders, such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, or epilepsy, tend to be exacerbated during sleep. Fortunately, most sleep disorders are amenable to therapy, which can include counseling, sleep hygiene, withholding of an offending agent, behavioral therapy, light therapy, or cautious drug therapy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "abstract": "Parental concerns about their young children's sleep are among the most frequent behavior problems discussed with pediatricians. In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child's period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

      "abstract": "Sleep problems are common in childhood. They are reported in about a quarter of young children, usually in the form of settling difficulties or night waking. The types and frequency of sleep disturbance tend to vary with age and, although some remit spontaneously, a substantial proportion of them persist. Particularly high rates of sleep disturbance occur in children who have learning disabilities, are physically ill, or psychologically disturbed. The immediate effects of sleep problems are important but so, also, are the longer-term effects which may influence the child's physical, psychological, and social development. Persistent sleep disturbance is associated with behavioural disturbance in children and may affect performance in school. Raised levels of maternal stress and impairment of parenting skills have also been reported as a consequence.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacological concerns need epidemiological elucidation\n\nPatients with depressive disorders could be more liable to accidents than others for several reasons. These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

      "title": "The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders Leon C. Lack1* 1 Flinders University, Australia Sleepiness is determined biologically by two comparable but independent factors: homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm sleep drive. The circadian sleepiness varies with a host of synchronised endogenous physiological and hormonal rhythms across the 24-hour period. Normal entrainment of this circadian system favours sleep at night (aprox. 2300-0700h) and alertness/productivity during the day. However, abnormalities of the circadian system in timing or amplitude can cause chronic or short term difficulties sleeping when desired and being alert when necessary. Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) results from a 2-6 hour delay from normal of the circadian system making it impossible to initiate sleep before 0100h. Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) results from an abnormally early timed circadian system making it impossible to maintain sleep past 0300h. Free-running rhythms do not remain stable in the 24-hour period but tend to drift later making night-time sleep and daytime alertness difficult for periods of days or weeks. Jet-lag and shiftwork usually produce short-lived sleep/wake problems. Since the most common disorders are from abnormal timing of the circadian system, tools to re-time circadian rhythms such as retinal light stimulation and exogenous melatonin administration can be used to treat these disorders. Light intensity, duration, and wavelength are important dimensions for treatment effect. However, the timing of light is critical for the effectiveness of these treatments. Bright light stimulation pushes the endogenous sleep period away from it like similar poles on a bar magnet (e.g. south/south) while the time of melatonin administration pulls the endogenous sleep period towards it like two opposite magnetic poles (e.g. north/south). The ‘push’ and ‘pull’ effects can be combined to shepherd the endogenous sleep period into the desired time (e.g. 2300-0700h). Other behavioural procedures and cognitive therapies can also be helpful in the treatment of these problematic circadian rhythm disorders.

      "title": "[Disruptive nocturnal behavior in elderly subjects: could it be a parasomnia?].",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are sleep-related abnormal behaviors. They are frequent and overlooked causes of nocturnal disruptive behavior in the elderly, especially when patients are cognitively impaired. Confusion and violence can result in sleep disruption, injuries for the patients or their bed partners, caregivers distress, and they can be a motive for institutionalization. Parasomnias include the NonREM sleep disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleep-related eating disorder), the REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and more rarely the parasomnia overlap syndrome, which associates both NREM and REM parasomnias. Patients with NREM sleep parasomnias are confused, eyes open, with a glazed look during their nocturnal behaviors, and they have a post-episode amnesia. They shout and bolt from the bed (night terrors), look about in a confused manner, walk and speak (sleepwalking), and eat peculiar or inedible food (sleep-related eating disorders). These behaviors, which are frequent in young adults, may be triggered by short-half live hypnotics in elderly. During the parasomnia, the brain is partially awake (enough to perform complex motor and verbal action), and partially asleep (without conscious awareness or responsibility). RBD is characterized by a loss of the normal muscle atonia that accompanies REM sleep. Patients have excessive motor activity such as punching, kicking, or crying out in association with dream content. RBD are frequent in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and may precede the cognitive or motor symptoms of these diseases by 5 to 10 years. RBD can also be promoted by antidepressants. When combined with thorough clinical interviews, the video-polysomnography is a powerful tool, especially for discriminating the parasomnia from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, sleep apneas and periodic leg movements. Ensuring safety and withdrawing deleterious treatments are useful in patients with violent activities, potential injurious or bothersome to other household members. Clonazepam and melatonin (3-12 mg) are highly effective for treating RBD.",

Fragmentation and repetitive arousals/awakenings characterize the sleep of persons with dementia. Confusion, agitation, and wandering can occur at night (“sun downing”), further contributing to sleep disruption (Box 10–1). Sleep complaints may be due primarily to the underlying dementia or to related sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements of sleep, or secondary depression. Reversal of the sleep-wake rhythms can be seen with patients complaining of nocturnal insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography may demonstrate decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and REM density. Sleep efficiency is reduced. Management includes proper sleep hygiene practices (eg, avoiding caffeine, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and eliminating daytime naps), and treatment of concurrent depression and medical disorders, including pain syndromes, that might contribute to sleep disturbance. Short-term use of hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, or eszopiclone, may be tried for insomnia.",

In the normal infant or the medically fragile infant due to prematurity or an acute episode, complaints from the patient or family sources force the medical team to find an explanation or a treatment, which are not always adequate. In other conditions such as asthma, obesity, anorexia nervosa, autism, cerebral palsy, hyperactivity, the sleeping disorders may be so unnoticed or remain insufficiently investigated. Globally, in this domain, the clinical description is often imprecise and sleep studies underused.

The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

      "title": "Circadian aspects in the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia",
      "abstract": "Summary Because the endogenous circadian pacemaker is a very strong determinant of alertness/sleep propensity across the 24 h period, its mistiming may contribute to symptoms of insomnia (e.g., difficulties initiating sleep and maintaining sleep) and to the development of insomnia disorder. Despite the separation of insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders in diagnostic nosology implying independent pathophysiology, there is considerable evidence of co‐morbidity and interaction between them. Sleep onset insomnia is associated with later timed circadian rhythms and can be treated with morning bright light to shift rhythms to an earlier timing. It is also possible that the causal link may go in both directions and that having a delayed circadian rhythm can result in enough experiences of delayed sleep onset to lead to some conditioned insomnia or insomnia disorder further exacerbating a delayed circadian rhythm. Early morning awakening insomnia is associated with an advanced circadian phase (early timing) and can be treated with evening bright light resulting in a delay of rhythms and an improved ability to sleep later in the morning and to obtain more sleep. There is some evidence suggesting that sleep maintenance insomnia is associated with a blunted amplitude of circadian rhythm that may be treated with increased regularity of sleep and light exposure timing. However, this is an insomnia phenotype that requires considerably more circadian research as well as further insomnia clinical research with the other insomnia phenotypes incorporating circadian timing measures and treatments.",

They may be classified as dysfunctions associated with transitions into sleep, partial arousals during sleep, or following arousals from sleep (2,3). Parasomnias can be categorized either as primary or secondary. Transitional parasomnias typically occur during wake-to-sleep transitions and can persist into N1 (Stage 1) sleep. Primary parasomnias can be subdivided by the sleep from which they appear, e.g., rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or both. Secondary parasomnias are more commonly associated with other organ system dysfunction and manifest symptoms during the sleep period.",

      "abstract": "Abnormal sleep can be insufficient, which constitutes insomnia; it can be excessive or inappropriate, which is hypersomnia, it can be misplaced with respect to the normal sleep-wakefulness rhythm, or it can be accompanied by various phenomena which do not belong to sleep itself (i.e. parasomnia). This is the format of most traditional classifications of sleep disorders. A modern classification has been introduced in 1990 and contains the description of 88 different sleep disturbances. They are classified in the main categories of dyssomnia, parasomnia and sleep disorders associated with psychiatric, neurological or somatic conditions. This classification is an excellent tool for the practice of sleep medicine and for the study of sleep disorders.",

The sleep disturbance causes significant distress or impairment of functioning. There may be a feeling of having been awake all night even when getting some sleep.\n\nPeople with comorbid disorders of physical or mental health, such as depression, have higher rates of insomnia. Depression and sleep disturbance are the first and third most common psychological reasons for patient encounters in general practice.4 Untreated, insomnia increases the risk of development or exacerbation of anxiety, depression, hypertension, and diabetes.5 6 This article outlines current concepts in insomnia and provides up to date information on treatment.\n\nMost people will experience sleep disturbance or acute insomnia at some point in any given year. This often occurs around predictable times of stress or when sleep patterns are disrupted, such as with travel, busy periods at work, illness, or emotional upset. While people may be distressed about sleep loss during acute insomnia, once the trigger factors are removed, sleep usually returns to normal.\n\nInsomnia becomes chronic when someone has difficulty either getting to sleep or staying asleep for at least three nights a week (not necessarily every night) for at least three months and is distressed by their sleep symptoms. …",

Inadequate sleep may impact children's development, mood and behaviour and in consequence the wellbeing of their parents and caregivers. In a prospective, randomised, multicenter, open, comparative clinical trial the effectiveness of homeopathic ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (Cypripedium pubescens D4, Magnesium carbonicum D10, Zincum valerianicum D12) in children with sleep disorders and restlessness was evaluated. <h3>Methods</h3> Children aged≤6 years, suffering from sleep disorders for≥1 month, were randomised to receive either ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (intervention) or the aminoacetic acid glycine (control) for 28 days. Effectiveness endpoints included the change of 7 sleep related complaints (SRC; time to sleep onset, difficulties maintaining sleep, sleep duration, troubled sleep (somniloquism), physical inactivity after awakening, restlessness for unknown reason, sleep disorders frequency; total score = maximum 11 points) and parent's treatment satisfaction. Safety parameters were the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the tolerability of the treatments. <h3>Results</h3> The SRC total score decreased from baseline median 7.0 points in both groups to 2.0 points in the intervention group (n=89 children) and 4.0 points in the control group (n=90 children) after 28 days of treatment. Children of the intervention group had overall significant higher odds of getting lower SRC total score (odds ratio: 4.45 (95%-CI: 2.77–7.14), p&lt;0.0001; ITT). First clinical differences between both groups were seen already after 14 days. At day 28 significantly more children in the intervention group showed absence of individual complaints (Chi<sup>2</sup>-test: all P values≤0.0475; ITT). More parents were either 'very satisfied' (n=33) or 'satisfied' (n=49) with ZinCyp-3–02 treatment compared to the number of parents with 'very satisfied' (n=10) and 'satisfied' (n=28) ratings in the control group. Only few ADRs occurred (ZinCyp-3–02: n=2 (nervousness, excitability); control: n=1 (excitement)) and almost all parents and physician (&gt;93% out of 179) rated the tolerability of both treatments as 'very good' or 'good'. <h3>Conclusions</h3> ZinCyp-3–02 showed to be a safe and effective treatment option for paediatric sleep disorders and restlessness.",

One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

      "title": "A PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY OF NIGHTMARES AND NIGHT TERRORS",
      "abstract": "Anxious arousals originate from all sleep stages and can be classified as: a) stage 4 night terrors; b) rapid eye movement (REM) nightmares; c) stage 2 awakenings; and d) hypnagogic nightmares. We have confirmed Broughton's finding that the night terror, the most severe type of episode, does not occur in sleep but as part of the \"arousal response,\" a complex of autonomic discharge and behavioral symptoms. The full blown night terror is a fight-flight episode combining sleep utterances, sleep walking and hallucinated or delusional mental content associated with terror. There is a significant positive correlation between intensity of night terror and the amount of delta sleep preceding arousal, e.g., stage 4 arousals designated as night terrors are preceded by longer periods of stage 4 than arousals of lesser intensity (p <.05). About two-thirds of both stage 4 and night terrors occurs in the first non-REM (NREM) period. The night terror arises out of physiologically quiescent sleep as indicated by the normal or slightly less them normal cardiorespiratory rates during the first NREM period and absence of skin resistance changes prior to the attack. The night terror is ushered in by sudden loud piercing screams, the subject passing into an aroused state characterized by alpha rhythm, motility, often somnambulism, intense autonomic discharge (precipitous doubling or even tripling of heart rate, great increase in respiratory amplitude, marked decrease in skin resistance), brief duration (1 to 3 minutes), varying degrees of amnesia for the episode, and rapid return to sleep. The night terror is a much more severe phenomenon than the REM nightmare although the latter is far more frequent. The nightmare occurs in REM sleep, is characterized by slight autonomic fluctuations, compared to the night terror, and, in half of instances, a \"desomatization\" of the anxiety response, that is, absence of its physiological concomitants. The REM state is physiologically activated to begin with, constituting a preparation for fright, possibly a buffer against the extreme terror of the stage 4 variety. The important problem of the triggering mechanisms of the night terror remains unsolved: whether the attack is precipitated by ongoing mental content during delta sleep, or represents a psychosomatic \"arousal response\" (Broughton). The fact that it can be induced artificially by sounding a buzzer speaks in favor of the latter, the finding of significant mental content in favor of the former. The night terror is not a dream but a symptom emerging from stage 3-4 sleep, associated with a rift in the ego's capacity to control anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Daytime breathing problems caused by neurologic lesions always worsen during sleep, and in certain cases abnormal breathing patterns are only seen during sleep or specific sleep states. The first clinical manifestation of maltase deficiency, myopathy, or myotonic dystrophy is often a sleep-related complaint, such as unexplained waking from sleep (insomnia) or daytime somnolence. Thus, systematic investigation during sleep of disorders impairing the loop involved in breathing is strongly encouraged. Lesions may involve sensory receptors, sensory pathways, brainstem-controlling neurons, upper motor neurons, descending motor pathways, lower motor neurons, motor nerves, neuromuscular junctions, or respiratory muscles. Most of these lesions lead to a decrease in or absence of inspiratory efforts (diaphragmatic apnea or hypopnea) during sleep. These events differ from the classic obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the recently described upper airway resistance syndrome, which usually involve mild or significant anatomic abnormalities of the upper airway and craniofacial region. The treatment of abnormal breathing during sleep has been improved by the development of nasal ventilation methods: continuous positive airway pressure, intermittent positive pressure, and volume ventilation. These therapeutic approaches can prevent tracheostomy and diaphragmatic pacing and are more efficacious than drug treatments. Long-term compliance is generally much better in breathing disorders secondary to neurologic impairments than in cases of mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.",

      "abstract": "Il sonno copre circa un terzo del tempo totale della vita di ognuno. In questi ultimi anni e notevolmente aumentato l’interesse, sia a livello clinico che di ricerca, riguardo al sonno e alle patologie e ai disturbi ad esso correlati. In particolare, numerose ricerche dimostrano che la qualita del sonno ha un fortissimo impatto sulla qualita della vita e un sonno “disturbato” costituisce un fattore di rischio per numerose patologie. Quindi l’interesse e rivolto non solo a monitorare l’insorgere di patologie del sonno (quali apnee notturne, insonnia, ecc, ) ma anche insufficienza cardiaca, e patologie psichiatriche, quali i disturbi bipolari, sui quali la qualita’ del sonno ha un forte impatto e conseguenze a livello clinico. Il sonno inoltre e una condizione che consente il monitoraggio in modo continuativo in condizioni con elevato grado di ripetibilita, in quanto numerosi fattori esterni e non controllabili presenti durante il giorno, non sono presenti durante il periodo di sonno. Tutto questo giustifica la nascita di numerosi sensori e dispositivi per il monitoraggio domiciliare del sonno, in alternativa alla polisonnografia utilizzata invece a livello clinico e all’interno di specifici reparti ospedalieri. In questo lavoro di tesi vengono presi in considerazione due tipologie di sensori: una maglietta sensorizzata che permette di acquisire ECG, respiro e movimenti mediante un accelerometro triassiale, ed un materasso sensorizzato che registra il ballistocardiogramma (BCG) da cui si ottengono: serie RR (cioe le durate dei singoli cicli cardiaci, i movimenti respiratorio e i movimenti corporei. Lo scopo dello studio e creare un sistema che, a partire dai segnali registrati, possa fornire informazioni sulla qualita del sonno e riesca ad identificare ed a quantificare la presenza di alcuni eventi che possono verificarsi durante il periodo di sonno e sono correlabili alla presenza di patologie. La parte principale dello studio e rivolta alla validazione dei dispositivi utilizzati e allo sviluppo di metodologie specifiche di analisi e classificazione dei segnali, al fine di consentire una valutazione automatica delle registrazioni. In particolare, sono stati sviluppati metodi per la classificazione degli stadi del sonno, l’identificazione di eventi cardiovascolari e respiratori, la classificazione degli stati emotivi (con particolare riferimento al disordine bipolare). I metodi sviluppati sono stati validati su casistiche di soggetti di controllo e su soggetti patologici e hanno dimostrato l’efficacia delle metodiche implementate. Nuovi parametri verranno introdotti e testati e le procedure verranno rese completamente automatiche al fine di facilitare l’utilizza domiciliare da parte di utilizzatori che non abbiamo una specifica preparazione.",

Poor sleep can inhibit rapid growth and development in early childhood.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s not just about sleep duration; the time one goes to bed also plays an important role in the physical, emotional, and cognitive development of children.\r\n\r\nA consistent early bedtime is especially important for young children transitioning from biphasic sleep (where children still nap during the day) to monophasic sleep (where sleep happens at night).\r\n\r\nLate sleepers don’t always get the recommended amount of sleep but evidence also suggests late bedtime is associated with sleep quality problems and difficulty falling asleep.\r\n\r\nAll this can add up to concentration, memory, and behaviour issues in children.",

      "abstract": "There are many reasons to take into consideration the sleep disorders in the elderly. The sleep quality degrades with age and is strongly affected by medical conditions, intrinsic sleep disorders, or by a combination of these factors. Other age-related conditions such as severe dementia, dependence or living in institution worsen sleep disturbances in older people. When living alone elderly people, being cognitively impaired and medically disabled, may not be able to complain about sleep problems. Sleep disorders are thus underdiagnosed, unmarked, and insufficiently investigated in the elderly. In this heterogeneous population, sleep assessment should include a global geriatric approach and be individually adapted for each subject. The sleep interview must specially include medical comorbidities, medication uses, and aged-related changes of lifestyle such as retirement, loss of spouse, hospitalization or institutionalization. In the elderly with loss of autonomy, standard sleep assessment is not always adequate and must be replaced by shorter, simpler or observation-based tests such as the Sleep disorders inventory, Observation-based nocturnal sleep inventory, Observation and interview based diurnal sleepiness inventory. When sleep log is impossible, actimetry is an excellent alternative for studying sleep-wake rhythm. Ventilatory polygraphy is a simpler test for detecting sleep apnea than polysomnography. Utilization of sophisticated investigations should be discussed when the feasibility and usefulness is limited.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Restless Sleep Disorder (RSD) is characterized by frequent nocturnal movements of large muscle groups or a complaint of restless sleep by observers with associated daytime dysfunction.1 RSD, like other movement disorders of sleep, is associated with low iron stores.2 Children with RSD have increased NREM sleep instability and a propensity for parasomnia.2 No reports to date have demonstrated the use of iron therapy for parasomnia in patients with RSD. Furthermore, studies are limited in very young children with this disorder as they currently fall outside proposed diagnostic criteria.1 Report of Cases: A 2 year-old male presented to the sleep clinic with parental complaints of nightly sleep initiation and maintenance difficulty, mild snoring, restless sleep, episodes of sleepwalking and night terrors multiple times per week. Symptoms worsened over 6 months and were associated with daytime irritability and behavioral problems. Sleep quality measures assessed progress between visits: the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance (PROMIS SD) and Sleep Related Impairment (PROMIS SRI). Serum ferritin was initially 20ug/L. Polysmnogram demonstrated no significant sleep related breathing disorder, a large muscle group movement index of 14, periodic limb movement index of 3. Initial treatment included oral iron therapy, scheduled awakenings, and hypnotic dose melatonin. The sleep psychologist addressed limit setting and negative sleep associations with improved insomnia symptoms but parasomnia and restless sleep continued. The parent noted reduction in both movements and parasomnia frequency after one month of iron therapy. After a 3 month period on treatment, the parent reported complete cessation of the parasomnia, drastic reduction in restlessness, and near resolution of insomnia. Sleep quality measure PROMIS SD improved by 11, demonstrating reduced sleep disturbance. PROMIS SRI did not change. Ferritin level increased to 47ug/L. Conclusion RSD in a very young child with NREM parasomnia responded to oral iron therapy improving overall sleep quality. This case demonstrates the relationship between relative iron deficiency, RSD and associated parasomnia. Support (If Any) 1. DelRosso LM, Ferri R, Allen RP, et al.

The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be “things that go bump in the night”, or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

Recent investigations have related sleep deprivation with obesity, metabolic disorders, heart disease, mental health problems and dementia. Recently, more investigations have focused on the multiple alterations suffered by the immune system in cases of sleep deprivation. In order to make an opportune diagnosis of insomnia, it is vital to obtain a detailed history of the patients' sleep habits.

Additionally, sleep disorders can have serious consequences, including fatal accidents related to sleepiness. Disturbed sleep can be a primary diagnosis itself or a component of another medical or psychiatric disorder. Narcolepsy is plausibly caused by an abnormality of REM-inhibiting mechanisms, and recent research involving hypocretin, a neurotransmitter, suggests that hypocretin is significantly reduced in narcolepsy patients.

Central nervous system hyperarousal, either as pre-existing and/or induced by psychiatric pathology and worsened by stressful events, as well as aging- and menopause-related physiological decline of sleep mechanisms appears to be at the core of this common sleep disorder. Finally, there is emerging evidence that the levels of physiologic hyperarousal are directly related to the degree of polysomnographically documented sleep disturbance in insomnia patients, suggesting that objective measures of sleep duration in insomnia may be a useful marker of the medical severity of the disorder.",

In addition, other secondary symptoms may also occur, such as headache, dry mouth orblurred vision, among others. It is a problem that has a clear impact on the quality of life of those who sufferit and that can lead them to significantly reduce their social activity and negatively condition their work.Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence,nocturia, and/or frequency in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology. Sacral neuromodulation is anewer surgical therapy for refractory OAB.Aim of Study: Is to assess the sacral neuromodulation (SN) safety and efficacy in refractory overactivebladder patients.Patients and Methods: In the period from November 2015 to May 2017. the unit of neurogenic bladderand neuromodulation in (Gazi Al_Harriry) surgical specialty hospital, medical city complex 27 patient agedfrom (17—55) year old were complaining from refractory overactive bladder. All the 27 patients underwentstage1 &amp; stage2 SNS devices implantation.Results: Patients of urgency incontinence (group1) demonstrated that the number of leak was significantlyreduced (p=0.01) after implantation of SN, (11.6_2.7) leak/day pre&amp; post SN, numbers of pads (6.9 _ 0.8)pad/day pre&amp;post SN. Patients with urgency frequency (group 2), numbers of voids/day pre &amp; post SNimplantation decreased significantly (p=0.01) (14.7 _ 6) voids /day. The voided volume increased significantly(p=0.02) from (136.4 _ 371.8) ml/void. The urgency episodes were decreased significantly (p=0.01) from(6.4 _ 2.1) episode/day. The complications occurred in 5 patients (18.5%). Two patients (7.4%) developedpain after trauma to the back, lead migration, lack of efficacy of device, treated by reprogramming thedevice, one patient (3.7%) get infection at the site of device implantation, SN was removed , there was onefemale patient (3.7%) got pregnancy and devise was deactivated.

The presence of recurrent periods of irresistible sleep in the same day was found in 13.2%, recurrent naps in the same day in 1.9%, non-restorative sleep despite a nighttime sleep of more than 9 hours (0.7%), as well as a sleep drunkenness (4.4%). Adding criteria for duration and frequency (minimum of 3 times per week and duration of at least 3 months), having social or professional impairment and psychological distress, and after excluding significant associated comorbidities, the prevalence fall to 1.5%. These very important prevalence hypersomnolence figures constitute an excellent argument to educate doctors and health authorities on the need to identify and support the excessive sleepiness disorders.",

These events encompass abnormal sleep related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Parasomnias are classified as: 1) disorders of arousal (from non-rapid eye movement, or NREM, sleep); 2) parasomnias usually associated with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep; and 3) other parasomnias. This sleep disorders in childhood are common, and often more frequent than in adults. Clinicians should be aware that many pediatric parasomnias have benign and self-limited nature. Most of the parasomnias may not persist into late childhood or adolescence. Parasomnias in adults often differ in type from childhood parasomnias and may portend significant psychiatric disturbances or neurodegenerative disorders. A reliable diagnosis can often be made from a detailed history from the patient and, if possible, the parents or bed partner. Detailed overnight investigations of parasomnias are usually not required. The non-REM parasomnias are more common in community although REM parasomnias are more likely to be",

The first includes disorders of arousals, namely confusional arousals (and their recently identified variants of sleep-related abnormal sexual behaviors), sleep terrors, and sleepwalking. REM sleep parasomnias include REM sleep behavior disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorders. Other parasomnias include sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning, exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder. The latter shares many features with the disorders of arousals, being frequently associated to sleepwalking. Hence, parasomnias comprise a variety of abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, dreaming, and autonomic phenomena that emerge from sleep as an expression of an anomalous central nervous system activation during sleep.",

One of the most common complaints of parents of infants and toddlers is that their child either has difficulty going to bed or wakes multiple times per night. These nightly struggles can leave parents tired, frustrated, and very stressed. Sleep-onset associations are certain conditions that are necessary for a child to fall asleep at bedtime and then return to sleep with each normal arousal during the night. Limit-setting sleep disorder presents as bedtime stalling or refusal to go to bed at an appropriate time. When limits are set, children typically fall asleep quickly and easily. Behavioral insomnia of childhood impacts not only the functioning and behavior of the child, but also the entire household. Sleep problems in children also negatively impact parents and caregivers.",

Primary sleep disturbances are thought to be a disorder of hyperarousal, while a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction has also been confirmed. Secondary sleep disorders have been associated with a large number of potential causes, both physical and psychological. Sleep disturbances in palliative care can be due to either the advanced disease and/or its treatment. Chronic medication use, neurological or psychiatric disorders, as well as environmental factors, can also present contributing factors.

Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described.

The notion of confusional arousals in children has received less attention overall compared with that concerning adults. The impression gained in adults is that, especially in response to forced awakenings, the behavioral disturbance in adult episodes is more forceful, vigorous and resistive, sometimes leading to violent behavior. Childhood confusional arousals do not usually require treatment, only advice to parents that they can be considered to be a passing phase. The same cannot necessarily be said of confusional arousals in adult life when they have more of a tendency to persist, depending on their etiology and relationship to other sleep disorders.",

Describe the role of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of apnea.\n\n3. Characterize the findings of long-term follow-up of infants who have apnea.\n\nAlthough apnea typically results from immaturity of the respiratory control system (see accompanying article in this issue), it also may be the presenting sign of other diseases or pathophysiologic states that frequently affect preterm infants. A thorough consideration of possible causes is always warranted, especially when there is an unexpected increase in the frequency of episodes of apnea or bradycardia (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. \nMultiple etiologic factors that may contribute to apnea in preterm infants. IVH=intraventricular hemorrhage.\n\n\n\nCentral nervous system problems, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, can precipitate apnea in the preterm infant. Asphyxia, including transient birth depression, may cause either episodic or prolonged apnea. Malformations of the brain or less likely, the spinal cord, should be considered in an otherwise healthy infant who presents with apnea at birth. Infections (bacteremia possibly accompanied by meningitis) may cause unstable breathing patterns and should prompt the appropriate evaluation and possibly antibiotic therapy. In the older infant, the onset of a viral illness such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection sometimes is heralded by apnea, although the precise mechanism whereby RSV presents with apnea is unclear. Anemia, another frequent problem in preterm infants, whether iatrogenic or due to bleeding, is a potential precipitating factor. Blood transfusions have been demonstrated to improve irregular breathing patterns in preterm infants, although the risk of blood transfusion has limited its use as treatment for apnea. It has been assumed, although unproven, that enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity, as with red blood cell transfusion, may decrease the likelihood of hypoxia-induced respiratory depression. Other disease states that may precipitate apnea include metabolic disorders such as …",

However, the clinical presentation of most of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is influenced by a combination of physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. These disorders lead to complaints of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, with impairment in important areas of functioning and quality of life. Current treatments primarily involve the use of circadian synchronizing agents, such as light, to realign the internal and external environment. These treatments are limited by the availability of adequate diagnostic tools and well-controlled clinical trials.

      "title": "Health Effects of Sleep Deprivation",
      "abstract": "Electrical lighting and increasing capital intensiveness have helped undermine the importance that society previously placed on obtaining adequate sleep. Even modest amounts of daily sleep loss accumulate as “sleep debt.” Sleep debt manifests in a myriad of ways, the most common being an increasing tendency to fall asleep, increased risk of accidental injury, impaired mood, and reduced psychomotor performance. Sleep debt can have far reaching consequences, both to an individual in terms of increased cardiovascular risk and to society at large, because of sleepiness-related fatigue and errors. Sleep specialists need to further their understanding of the physiologic and behavioral consequences of total, partial, and selective sleep stage deprivation, because they affect many organ systems. Studies of selective sleep stage deprivation also provide insights into the function of sleep. Evaluating the effects of sleep deprivation must take into account the following factors: (1) the duration of prior sleep, (2) circadian time frame, (3) arousal influences, and (4) subject and test characteristics. Sleep deprivation has been extensively studied in the acute experimental setting. Under extreme conditions, sleep deprivation is associated with mortality in laboratory animals. In the natural human environment, the behavioral consequence of chronic sleep debt in shift work intolerance is well described. The link between electrophysiological sleep disturbance and pathogenesis of disease is less well understood in both acute and chronic states. Additional investigation into the relationship between sleep deprivation and disease mechanisms, such as impaired glucose tolerance, hormonal dysregulation, and cytokine imbalance, will enhance our comprehension of this link.",

Normally, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is preceded by 90 to 100 minutes of non-REM sleep, whereas narcoleptics often have an REM-period at the onset of sleep (Hishikawa and Kaneki, 1965; Rechtschaffen et al., 1963).",

      "abstract": "Somnipathy can be categorized in to insomnia disorders, sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hyper somnolence, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, parasomnias, and others. It can be primary or secondary, signs and symptoms of which include exorbitant daytime sleepiness, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep and difficulty falling asleep. A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "title": "Nocturnal Enuresis: Current Concepts",
      "abstract": "Objectives After completing this article, readers should be able to: Nocturnal enuresis affects approximately 5 to 7 million children in the United States, making it the most common pediatric urologic complaint encountered by primary care physicians. Despite its prevalence, nocturnal enuresis remains incompletely understood, which can frustrate patients, family members, and physicians. Appropriate intervention is justified for the affected child because of the potential consequences of family stress, social withdrawal, and poor self-esteem.Enuresis refers to the persistence of inappropriate voiding of urine beyond the age of anticipated bladder control (age 4 to 5 y at the latest). The development of bladder control is a multidimensional process that requires sensory awareness of bladder fullness by the child, capacity for storage of urine, voluntary control of the bladder sphincter, psychological desire for control, and a positive training experience. Diurnal enuresis is involuntary leaking of urine during waking hours. Nocturnal enuresis refers to involuntary passage of urine during sleep and is classified as primary (no prior period of sustained dryness) or secondary (recurrence of nighttime wetting after 6 mo or longer of dryness). Recent urology literature describes another classification of nocturnal enuresis based on the presence or absence of other bladder symptoms. Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) is defined as a normal void occurring at night in bed in the absence of any other symptoms referable to the urogenital tract, and it precludes any daytime symptomatology. It is the focus of this article. Polysymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PNE) is bed-wetting associated with other bladder symptoms such as urgency, frequency,instability, or voiding dysfunction. Investigations of patients who have MNE reveal that they are clearly different from patients who have PNE.The spontaneous resolution rate of nocturnal enuresis is approximately 15% per year, with 1% of teenagers at 15 years of age still wetting the bed (Fig. 1). Parents may become concerned about nocturnal enuresis when their child reaches 5 to 6 years of age and is preparing to enter school. Most children are not concerned until 7 to 8 years of age. Approximately 80% to 85% of children who have nocturnal enuresis have MNE. Another 5% to 10% of cases meet the definition of PNE, with daytime wetting or other bladder symptoms. Organic causes are responsible for nocturnal enuresis in fewer than 5% of cases. Such organic causes must be searched for and ruled out if the history suggests their presence. There is a slight male predominance (about 60% overall) for nocturnal enuresis. Etiologic factors contributing to MNE include genetics, sleep arousal dysfunction,urodynamics, nocturnal polyuria, psychological components, and maturational delay. That the condition probably is multifactorial, with various contributing factors in any one patient, confounds attempts to base therapeutic approaches on etiology.A hereditary basis for nocturnal enuresis has been suspected for years. Studies of twins show a concordance rate of 43% to 68% for monozygotic and 19% to 36% for dizygotic twins. Seventy percent of children who have enuresis have a parent who has a history of the disorder. Studies indicate that if one parent had enuresis, the probability of a child having it is approximately 40% to 45%. If both parents were affected, the probability of a child having the condition increases to 70% to 77%. If neither parent had enuresis, only 15% of offspring will have enuresis. Chromosomes 12q, 13q, and 22 all have been named as possible locations of a gene(s) resulting in enuresis, but a specific mechanism for enuresis related to a gene locus is not known.The association between the presence of a full bladder and the sensation in the brain of a full bladder occurs in most children by the age of 5 years,which correlates with the normative standard in the United States for nocturnal dryness in 85% of 5-year-olds. Concurrently, by this age the child's pattern of several sleep/wake cycles daily, known as multiphasic sleep, has changed to a single period of sleep daily, known as monophasic sleep. Daytime urination control usually occurs first,followed by learning to arouse during sleep to the sensation of a full bladder. Many parents report that a child who has enuresis is more difficult to arouse from sleep than are other children in the home, but sleep studies have not documented a convincing association between a child's sound sleep and a nocturnal wetting episode.The relationship of sleep patterns with enuresis is an area of active research. In some studies, the enuretic event seemed to occur during nonREM sleep and could occur during any part of the night. In others,enuresis reportedly was caused by a mild disturbance in arousal, based on the finding that activation of the arousal center proceeded correctly, but the transition from light sleep to complete awakening was not achieved properly. In a subset of patients, the arousal center in the brain failed to activate, despite proper full bladder sensation. There is conflicting evidence that children who have enuresis may exhibit other parasomnias, such as sleepwalking and night terrors. A recurrent theme in sleep research is the child's inability to recognize the sensation of a full bladder during sleep and failure to awaken from sleep to urinate in an appropriate place. There appears to be a maturational pattern of progressive central nervous system \"recognition\" of bladder fullness and control over the micturition reflex.Some children who have enuresis may have a small bladder capacity. Functional bladder capacity in children may be estimated by the formula: age in years plus 2, which gives bladder capacity in ounces. By adolescence, this no longer applies; adult bladder capacity is approximately 10 to 15 oz. Children who have small bladder capacities probably represent a subgroup of patients who have MNE and presumably cannot hold the normal amount of urine produced at night. They are more likely to report frequent daytime voiding,some nights with multiple episodes of enuresis per night, and no history of attaining dryness.In some children who have normal bladder capacities,urgency may play a role in nocturnal enuresis. These children exhibit daytime urgency, but they can maintain bladder control during the day. They have a pattern of partial emptying of the bladder that results in frequent daytime urination to maintain continence and enuresis occurring at night when they cannot void as often. No evidence supports abnormal urodynamics in children who have MNE. Involuntary nighttime voiding in those who have MNE occurs with a urodynamically normal bladder at functional capacity. Because most patients who have abnormal urodynamics as an underlying cause for their nighttime enuresis also have daytime symptoms, asking patients about daytime voiding patterns in the initial history is important.Polyuria is defined as excessive urine production. It may be associated with chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Caffeine,alcohol, and medications also may cause it. Factors such as irregular food and drink intake and staying up late also may contribute. It seems reasonable to limit fluid intake several hours prior to bedtime because the most common cause of polyuria is habit polydipsia.Since first described in 1985, the theory that MNE is due to nocturnal polyuria with relative nocturnal deficiency of pituitary-produced antidiuretic hormone(ADH) has been controversial. Early studies reported that the plasma level of ADH did not increase during sleep in those who had enuresis compared with a rise in ADH among unaffected children, resulting in relative nocturnal polyuria as a factor in enuresis. Studies documenting the percentage of children who have enuresis and lack a nocturnal surge in ADH ranges from 25% to 100%, suggesting the presence of other factors. New research about polyuria and enuresis theorizes that a full bladder might communicate with the kidneys to reduce urine production. Some recent investigations also suggest abnormal osmoregulatory function in the kidney, with higher solute excretion among those who have enuresis.Most children who have enuresis have no psychological disorder. The dated concept that enuresis frequently is due to anxiety or stress is unproven. On the contrary, enuresis creates psychosocial problems for the bed-wetting child, including poor self-esteem,family stress, and social isolation. Secondary enuresis commonly has been attributed to psychological factors. Recent studies show no major psychological differences between children who have secondary enuresis and children who have no enuresis. If a child reverts to bed-wetting during treatment for enuresis or has increased episodes of bed-wetting during times of stress, it is more likely due to poor compliance with treatment. Children who have enuresis not only have lower self-esteem than unaffected children, but they have lower self-esteem than children who have chronic,debilitating illnesses. These study results both emphasize the profound impact that enuresis may have and justify a careful evaluation of psychosocial symptoms in the family and the patient.The fact that most children who have enuresis become dry in time with or without intervention supports maturational delay as a factor in MNE. At age 5 years,15% of children occasionally wet the bed compared with only 10% at 6 years of age. Perhaps development of central nervous system recognition of and response to the sensation of a full bladder is delayed, a concept that correlates strongly with the arousal dysfunction theory. Proposed abnormal urodynamic factors also may normalize as the child becomes older. A similar process of maturation over time is seen in other milestones of normal development,such as the age range of 9 to 15 months at which a child begins to walk. Maturational delay may be the most plausible and unifying concept among proposed etiologic factors in MNE.In addition to a detailed toilet training history, a family history of enuresis should be sought because it rarely is volunteered, even when known by a parent. Other pertinent details of a history include the onset and pattern of wetting, voiding behavior, sleep pattern, parasomnias, medical conditions, daytime urinary symptoms, bowel habits, and psychosocial factors. It also is important to assess both the family's and the patient's attitude toward the bed-wetting and their readiness to initiate and continue treatment. Questions about voiding patterns may reveal urgency or a history of small, frequent voids that suggests bladder instability or small bladder capacity. Organic causes of enuresis may be apparent by a history of dysuria (urinary tract infection),polyuria and polydipsia (diabetes insipidus or mellitus), encopresis (constipation), abnormal urine stream (lower obstructive lesions), gait disturbances(spinal cord pathology), or nighttime snoring(adenoidal hypertrophy). A thorough and thoughtful history is the means by which the infrequent organic causes of enuresis are separated from the majority of cases that have no organic etiology (TableT1). Most children who have nocturnal enuresis will have normal findings on physical examination. In addition to assessing the child's height, weight, and blood pressure, perform a complete examination, paying careful attention to the urogenital, neurologic, and gastrointestinal systems. A palpable bladder or palpable stool may be present on abdominal examination, ectopic ureter or signs of sexual abuse on urogenital examination, or abnormal gait apparent during neurologic examination. Cremasteric, anal, abdominal,and deep tendon reflexes that reflect spinal cord function all should be tested. The skin of the lower back should be inspected for the presence of a sacral dimple, hair patches, or vascular birthmarks, which can be clues to spinal dysraphism. Mouth breathing may suggest sleep apnea with associated enuresis due to adenoidal hypertrophy. Direct observation of the urinary stream in the office is important, especially if findings on the history suggest an abnormality. The family can measure bladder capacity at home prior to the initial evaluation or it can be measured in the office by having the child drink 12 oz of fluid on arrival, then voiding into a calibrated cup.All children who have enuresis should have urinalysis of a clean-catch midstream urine specimen (Fig 2). The ability to concentrate urine to 1.015 or greater rules out diabetes insipidus and the absence of glucose rules out diabetes mellitus as causes of nocturnal enuresis. Further laboratory testing is unnecessary for MNE. A urine culture should be obtained for symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection on history or findings on urinalysis. Routine radiologic or ultrasonographic imaging studies of the urinary tract or cystoscopy are not recommended for children who have MNE. PNE may require further evaluation with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), renal and bladder ultrasonography, or urodynamic testing. When enuresis is resistant to treatment and the history suggests a sleep disorder, a sleep study may be useful to look for sleep apnea or parasomnias.An important factor in any pediatric treatment is the child's motivation and acceptance. Parents also must support the child and the treatment program for maximal effectiveness. The child's age is a critical factor when formulating a treatment plan. Consideration of treatment is guided by the clinician's understanding of the changing prevalence of enuresis in school-age children and the effect of enuresis on the child's self-esteem and family function. Timing of the intervention should be tailored to the individual child and family.Although a child's self-esteem can be harmed by MNE, even at early school age, the effects are variable. Some school-age children and their parents are not bothered by the child's enuresis; others experience anxiety and stress. It is reasonable to discuss MNE during a health supervision visit and provide facts for families of patients at 6 or 7 years of age. The maturational aspects of nighttime awakening to void should be explained to parents and likened to other familiar developmental milestones that occur over a range of time rather than at a specific age. Providing plausible medical explanations, identifying a family history of enuresis, and defining its age-specific prevalence may lessen the burden on the child. Parents should understand that punishment or negative reinforcement is counterproductive, both in resolving the enuresis and in protecting the child's self-esteem. For children and families who are bothered by the child's enuresis,targeted intervention is recommended by age 8 years at the latest. In general, MNE should be thoroughly explained, selectively treated, and never ignored.This approach begins with educating parents and the child about enuresis, a process that usually allays guilt. Handouts with printed instructions can teach the parents and the child to manage the condition. Positive reinforcement can be initiated by setting up a diary or chart to monitor progress and establishing a system to reward the child for each night that he or she is dry. The child should be taken out of diapers or training pants and encouraged to empty the bladder completely prior to going to bed. The child should participate in morning cleanup as a natural, nonpunitive consequence of wetting. The risk of secondary psychological injury to the child's self-esteem is minimized by discouraging ridicule from siblings and by avoiding a critical, demoralizing approach.Because excessive fluid intake before bedtime can cause increased nocturnal urine production, as can caffeinated beverages and certain foods (eg, dairy products, citrus juices, chocolate), restricting fluids for 2 hours prior to bedtime is reasonable. The child should agree to fluid restriction, however, rather than having it imposed. The rate of complete resolution of enuresis with motivational therapy alone is estimated to be only 25%, but up to 70% of children who have MNE have some reduction in the number of wet nights. Once consistently dry nights are achieved, the reported relapse rate is low. Motivational therapy is a reasonable first-line approach, especially with the younger child. If unsuccessful after a trial of 3 to 6 months, a different treatment program should be considered.This approach includes dry-bed training and classic conditioning therapy using an enuresis alarm system. Hypnotherapy also may be part of a comprehensive program to treat enuresis. This therapy involves an age-appropriate explanation of how the brain and bladder communicate, taking the mystery out of enuresis by educating the patient and family, teaching relaxation techniques, and having the child practice imagery of awakening to urinate in the toilet or staying dry all night. It can be combined with an alarm system. Frequent office visits are required initially until the physician is certain that the child can practice imagery at home; then, visits may be monthly. Referral to a behavioral pediatrician or clinic may be necessary if the primary care physician does not have the necessary training or time for this approach.Dry-bed training (as described by Azrin and Thienes in 1978) involves waking the child on a progressive schedule at decreasing intervals over several nights,having the child change pajamas and bedding if wet or walk to the toilet when voiding is needed. As in the use of alarm therapy, the eventual goal is to have the child self-awaken to void. Although a high cure rate is reported with this technique by the authors, it is a more time- and labor-intensive process than most families are willing to undertake.Enuresis alarms have the highest overall cure rate of any available treatment. They also represent the best-researched behavioral intervention. Alarm systems can be used in combination with motivational and other behavioral therapy techniques or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Several different alarm devices range in cost from $50 to $75. Insurance companies may cover an enuresis alarm with a prescription from the physician describing it as a medical device. In contrast to the older bell-and-pad type of alarms, the new devices are portable, small,and worn directly on the child's clothing. They emit a transistorized audio or vibratory alarm when urine is sensed in the underpants.Alarms are most effective when combined with other behavioral or pharmacologic therapy. The alarm wakes the child or parent from sleep, who then implements the appropriate component of the behavioral program. The alarm allows the parent and child to intervene and monitors bed-wetting as the program proceeds. Parents and child should be told that this treatment requires a long-term commitment and may take several months to achieve a cure. The device can be discontinued when the child has had three consecutive weeks of dry nights. The cure rate may be as high as 70% long-term. Among the 10% to 15% of children who relapse,most can be treated successfully with a repeat of the original alarm program.Methods to reduce alarm failure include pretesting the child for his or her ability to awaken to the alarm and encouraging parents and child to continue using the alarm. Failure also can be reduced by enabling the child who is afraid of the dark to walk to the toilet using a flashlight or night light in the room or by offering other options to the child who is reluctant to try an enuresis alarm. If a child does not awaken to the alarm during pretesting, dry-bed training or parent awakening should precede the use of the alarm. One study showed that an ordinary alarm clock used with dry-bed training was as effective as an enuresis alarm. This may be an attractive alternative to families who cannot afford an alarm or whose insurance will not cover it.(See the 1997 Pediatrics in Review article by Schmitt for practical tips on successful use of the enuresis alarm.)Medication is an attractive treatment modality for parents who hope for relatively effortless success. However, medication alone for initial treatment of nocturnal enuresis is never preferred and seldom should be considered before 8 years of age, even in combination therapy. Three drugs are used most commonly for the treatment of enuresis: imipramine, desmopressin(DDAVP), and oxybutynin. Imipramine and DDAVP have been evaluated in the treatment of MNE; oxybutynin is used primarily in polysymptomatic enuresis.Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been used for more than 3 decades to treat nocturnal enuresis. It appears to increase bladder capacity through a weak anticholinergic effect and also may decrease detrusor muscle contractions via noradrenergic effects. The starting dose is 25 mg taken 1 hour before bedtime for children ages 6 to 8 years and 50 to 75 mg for older children and adolescents. The duration of action is 8 to 12 hours. The dose may be increased in 25-mg increments weekly up to 75 mg. Therapy may continue from 3 to 9 months, with a slow tapering of medication recommended over 3 to 4 weeks in 25-mg decrements. Imipramine is relatively inexpensive,and the clinical response is usually apparent during the first week of treatment. The initial success rate(dry at 6 months posttreatment) is reported to be 15% to 50%, but the relapse rate is high following drug discontinuation.When used at the recommended dosage, mild side effects include irritability, dry mouth, decreased appetite, headaches, and sleep disturbances. An accidental or intentional overdose, however, can have serious and potentially lethal effects, including ventricular dysrhythmias, seizures, and coma. Because of its narrow toxic/therapeutic ratio, some clinicians are understandably reluctant to use imipramine to treat a relatively benign, self-limiting condition such as nocturnal enuresis. If imipramine therapy is selected,the physician must counsel the family carefully about the dangerous potential of its accidental ingestion,safe storage of the drug, and supervision of the child taking the medication.DDAVP is a synthetic analog of arginine vasopressin (ADH). Acting on the distal tubules of the kidney, it increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts, producing a more concentrated, lower volume of urine. The use of DDAVP to treat nocturnal enuresis is based on the observation that some children who have enuresis do not have the normal nocturnal rise in ADH production, potentially leading to polyuria. DDAVP theoretically reduces urine volume at night in such children, who thereby can avoid a full bladder at night.DDAVP is available in an oral form and a nasal spray. The bioavailability is only 1% for the tablet and 10% for the nasal spray. Its duration of action is extended (approximately 10 to 12 h), and it is rapidly absorbed from the nasal mucosa. The initial dose of DDAVP is 20 mcg or one 10-mcg puff in each nostril within 2 hours of bedtime, regardless of the patient's age. The dose may be increased in increments of 10 mcg every 1 or 2 weeks up to a maximum dose of 40 mcg. The response to DDAVP usually can be evaluated within a few days of starting therapy. Patients may remain on medication for 3 to 6 months,then should begin a slow decrease of the dose by 10 mcg/mo. If a child remains enuretic after 6 months of therapy, combination therapy may be considered. If oral medication is preferred, the starting dose is 0.2 mg(one tablet) administered 1 hour before bedtime. If there is no response within 1 week, the dose can be titrated by 0.2 mg up to a maximum of 0.6 mg nightly.Side effects of DDAVP are rare and include abdominal discomfort, nausea, headache, and epistaxis. Symptomatic hyponatremia with seizures has been reported very rarely, usually in the context of exceeding the recommended dosage. Nonetheless,nighttime fluid restriction is a reasonable recommendation for those receiving DDAVP. Contraindications include habit polydipsia,hypertension, and heart disease. There are few data on long-term use of DDAVP. In a Swedish study that monitored children who had MNE, 22% became dry with DDAVP, a response not significantly different from the spontaneous cure rate of 15% per year. All patients, however, had a marked reduction in the number of enuretic events per month. More patients remained dry after slow tapering of the DDAVP dose than following abrupt discontinuation of the medicine. Various studies show immediate response rates as high as 70% and relapse rates as high as 95%. Moffat et al reviewed 18 controlled studies of DDAVP and found overall that only 25% of children were completely dry on the medicine, with a relapse rate similar to that noted previously.DDAVP's high initial response rate is attractive for episodic use to treat enuresis, alone or in combination with other treatments. It can be very useful for summer camp and sleepovers to prevent enuresis. DDAVP also may be useful to bridge the gap between enuresis and dryness during other treatments. Using DDAVP episodically also reduces its rather significant cost, which may be $150 to$250 for 1 month of nightly use.Oxybutynin chloride is an anticholinergic and antispasmodic drug that has a role in reducing uninhibited bladder contractions. It is used primarily to treat children who have symptoms of daytime urgency or frequency in addition to nighttime enuresis. It appears to be no better than placebo in treating children who have MNE. Side effects are related to the anticholinergic action of the drug and include flushing, blurred vision, constipation, tremor, and decreased ability to sweat. The recommended starting dose is 5 to 10 mg/d (or 0.1 mg/kg) for most children. This drug is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat enuresis in children younger than 5 years of age. Hyoscyamine is another anticholinergic agent used to treat bladder instability that recently has received attention in clinical studies on enuresis. These medications may play a role in the treatment of PNE.As a condition that has no single etiology and various causal factors in any one patient, it is not surprising that a single method of treating nocturnal enuresis is often of limited success. Age-related strategies that combine more than one treatment may improve response rates.For young children and their parents, reassurance and education about enuresis are of utmost importance. They must understand that nocturnal wetting is not the child's fault. There is no place for ridicule or a punitive approach to the problem by parents, siblings,or peers. Previously described motivational and behavioral methods that assist the child in waking to void and that praise successful dryness suit this age group best.For children who still have nocturnal enuresis at this age and for whom the child and family request an intervention, the enuresis alarm gives the best results in terms of response rate and low relapse rate. This also is the age at which intermittent use of medication such as DDAVP can be useful for special events such as an overnight at a friend's home or a camping trip.Because of the emotional impact of persistent bed-wetting in adolescence, aggressive intervention is indicated. If use of an enuresis alarm does not stop or greatly reduce the wetting episodes, continuous use of medication is justified as additional treatment. When 2 months of dryness using the combination of alarm and medication are achieved, the medication should be tapered gradually while continuing to use the enuresis alarm.Assessments of treatment results of enuresis must consider the rate of initial response, the duration of response, and the relapse rate. In general, studies comparing an alarm system with placebo or drug therapy show the alarm system to have the most favorable combination of initial response rate (60% to 70%) and relapse rate (10% to 30%), especially when dryness is assessed at 12 months after initiating treatment. The success rate with alarms, of course, depends on continued use of the alarm. A significant number of families (30% to 50%) discontinue use of the alarm within only 2 to 3 weeks. Studies evaluating medication alone compared with placebo show favorable initial response(10% to 60%), but a significant relapse rate (80% to 90%) when the child is off medication. Two studies documented identical rates of 56% of children maintaining dryness after 12 months' use of an alarm system. In both studies,the rate of dryness after 12 months when using medication alone, either imipramine or DDAVP, was no better than the expected improvement rate of about 15% with no treatment.Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem seen by the primary care physician. It remains a source of considerable anxiety for the child, parents, and sometimes the pediatrician. In spite of several decades of research, no single explanation or classification of enuresis is sufficient. The nocturnal wetting episode occurs when the child does not awaken during sleep at a time when urine volume exceeds functional bladder capacity, due either to excess urine production, small bladder capacity, or both. This perspective requires the practitioner to take a careful history for polyuria, sleep dysfunction, and daytime bladder symptoms to devise the best treatment for each child. Once organic causes are ruled out by careful history and physical examination, no laboratory or radiographic evaluation is necessary beyond a simple urinalysis. Although a spontaneous cure rate of 15% per year can be expected, intervention may benefit some children through earlier attained dryness and improved self-esteem. Behavior therapies, including alarm systems, have the best long-term results, but they require strong family commitment and do not offer immediate results. Medication has a better short-term cure rate than motivational/behavioral therapy, but relapse rates are high when drugs are discontinued. A combination of behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy is reasonable if monotherapy fails. The ultimate goal is for the child to maintain nighttime dryness or to self-awaken to void at night.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are a group of disorders in which the individual's sleep is misaligned with the normal sleep and wake times. This is due to lack of synchrony between the body circadian clock timekeeping mechanism and the 24-hour day-night cycle. Some of the disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder, advanced sleep phase disorder, free running disorder, and irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder are due to abnormalities in the circadian clock timekeeping mechanism. There are other disorders such as shift work disorder and jet lag disorder in which the circadian clock timekeeping mechanism is normal but the problems arise due to mismatch caused by extrinsic factors (night or early morning shift work and air travel across multiple time zones). Proper recognition and treatment of these disorders are necessary to ameliorate the symptoms and minimize the adverse social and occupational impact.",

Yet, excessive daytime sleepiness is not only common, and it often goes unrecognized. It can contribute to accidents, produce or exacerbate health conditions, reduce efficiency and productivity, interfere with social relationships, and diminish quality of life. The spectrum of common sleep disorders includes circadian rhythm changes, shiftwork requirements, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, also known as insomnia. In many cases, however, sleep deprivation is the choice of the patient, chosen in response to long commutes, academic rigor, or occupational matters. Regardless of the sleep disorder that a patient has, good sleep behavior or \"sleep hygiene\" is essential.",

Avoidance can also feature prominently. In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction. Postnatal onset has been more associated with fears of deliberately harming the baby (for example, ‘I could touch my baby inappropriately’), associated with avoidance of …",

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

The interesting finding here was its association with nocturnal enuresis (NE)/bedwetting.Conclusion/clinical relevance:NE could be a predisposing factor for sleep bruxism in children, as it causes emotional stress and has a negative impact on a child's self esteem. Psychological support and techniques for overcoming NE, like a scheduled waking program at night helps children with these problems by alleviating the associated stress. In addition, NE and bruxism are often associated with other sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and hence, child bruxers require careful medical evaluation to rule out such potential interactions.",

Nurses working permanent night shifts may have major disturbances in their daytime sleep especially in the duration of sleep which is much less than that of night sleep, and this may be due to attending to essential daytime necessities (e.g. cooking, feeding, shopping and spending time with family). Insomnia was significantly associated with working night shifts among Norwegian nurses [1]. Individual factors that are associated with insomnia among permanent night workers are older age, lower circadian adjustments, being married, having children, physical inactivity and excessive intake of caffeine [2]. Nurses working permanent night shifts frequently lament about problems in commencing and/or sustaining sleep, as well as a decline in sleep duration [3].

Not only are seizures common in the first few days of life, but they are also difficult to diagnose because the clinical manifestations are varied, subtle, and unlike those seen at other times of life. The diagnosis of seizure should be considered if a baby makes odd repetitive stereotyped movements of the limbs or face. Subtle seizures can manifest as repetitive blinking, chewing, eye-rolling or darting tongue movements. Seizures can also involve a stare without blinking, forced eye deviation, peculiar limb postures, apnea or a fixed smile. Ocular manifestations are common, and eye closure during a suspicious event makes the diagnosis of seizure less likely, although it does not exclude it completely [1]. Myoclonic jerks can be normal in sleep but myoclonic epilepsy does occasionally manifest in the neonatal period. Clinical seizures are often short-lived in babies; typically the baby becomes still, there is a change in breathing pattern (sometimes apnea), and a change in level of alertness followed by subtle repetitive movements involving the face or limbs. The whole episode may be over in less than a minute, but the same pattern does tend to recur, in which case it becomes more suspicious.",

Under entrainment to the 24-h day-night cycle, the sleep-wake pattern may assume various phase relationships to the circadian pacemaker, as indexed, for example, by abnormally long or short intervals between the onset of melatonin production or the core body temperature minimum and wake-up time. Advanced and delayed sleep phase syndromes and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome have been variously ascribed to abnormal intrinsic circadian periodicity, deficiency of the entrainment mechanism, or—most simply—patterns of daily light exposure insufficient for adequate phase resetting. The timing of sleep is influenced by underlying circadian phase, but psychosocial constraints also play a major role. Exposure to light early or late in the subjective night has been used therapeutically to produce corrective phase delays or advances, respectively, in both the sleep pattern and circadian rhythms. Supplemental light exposure in fall and winter can reduce the hypersomnia of winter depression, although the therapeutic effect may be less dependent on timing.",

      "title": "Does the Patient Have Abnormal Movements at Night?",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders are generally characterized by simple movements that disturb sleep or the ability to fall asleep. These disorders manifest symptoms of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness or tiredness. In order to make an accurate diagnosis, an all-night video recording is desired to differentiate these disorders from parasomnias. Sleep-related movement disorders or congenital simple movements can cause disturbed sleep. All-night recordings are recommended to differentiate the sleep-related movement disorder from parasomnias. Patients are usually unaware of movements or sleep disturbance. Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders are repetitive and stereotyped with rhythmic motor behaviors. These movements occur during drowsiness or early sleep and involve large muscle groups and include body rocking, head rolling, or head banging. They are more common in children and infants. In most situations, they do not have any significant consequences. Many sleep-related movement disorders are a result of a medical condition due to side effects or withdrawal from medication or a substance, or they could be an isolated symptom or normal variant. Many of these disorders of movement tend to overlap with other sleep conditions including parasomnias. In general, parasomnias are undesirable physical events that occur when falling asleep, during sleep, or while waking up. They include abnormal sleep-related complex movements, behaviors, and autonomic nervous system activity. They significantly contrast with sleep-related movement disorders. Parasomnias tend to result in injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Sometimes they affect the patient, the bed partner, or both. Non-REM-related parasomnias include confused arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Patients tend to have a partial or complete amnesia for episodes. REM-related parasomnias include a REM behavior disorder also known as RBD. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged to elderly males. However, it is often associated with an underlying neurologic disorder such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, narcolepsy, cerebrovascular accident, or Lewy body dementia. Nightmare disorder is apparent during rapid eye movement sleep and often leads to awakening with a bowel movement. While prevalent in the general population, this is common in children. Nightmares are frequently associated with psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder. The patient remembers the dreams and can describe the nightmare, which usually involves threats to survival, security, or physical activity. Nightmares can have a negative impact on family functioning and lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or low energy. It can also impair occupational or educational functions.",

Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are a heterogeneous group of undesirable, but not always pathological, manifestations that accompany sleep. They consist in abnormal behaviors due to the inappropriate activation of cognitive processes or physiological systems such as the motor and/or autonomic nervous systems. In some cases, they can result in sleep disruption and injuries, with adverse health or psychosocial consequences for patients, bed-partners or both. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, parasomnias are distinguished on the basis of the stage of sleep in which they appear: (1) parasomnias arising from NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep, which include arousal disorders (confusional arousal, sleep terror, sleepwalking) and sleep-related eating disorders; (2) parasomnias associated with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep; and (3) “other parasomnias” occurring in any sleep stage (eg, sleep enuresis, exploding head syndrome). This chapter describes the NREM parasomnias and the “other parasomnias,” underlining the more recent and significant advances that have provided a better understanding of their clinical features and pathophysiology.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is the most serious and disabling of all mental disorders, affecting just under 1 % of the population. While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "abstract": "OF all the symptoms met with in those who suffer from the psychoneuroses, one of the most troublesome, both to the patient and the physician, is that of insomnia.The long hours of wakefulness at night make more impression on the patient than any of his other symptoms.and unless relief can be brought in this respect the phy- sician will find himself hampered at every turn.In dealing with insomnia it is essential to get a clear idea as to what constitutes normal sleep; otherwise bad advice based on ill- conceived ideas may be given to the patient, with the result that his last state may be worse than his first.For example, it is common to hear a neurotic told to tire himself out and he will get sleep.Apart from the fact that in spite of extreme fatigue the patient often does not sleep, the person who gives this advice has not considered whether the sleep which is the result of fatigue is the same as natural sleep, or whether it is of the same benefit to the patient.Much has been written on the subject of sleep, but no very satis- factory definition has yet been arrived at.It would seem to be the result of a withdrawal of vital energy from the higher levels of con- sciousness so that they no longer express themselves as conscious processes.The deeper the sleep, the more extensively is the content of what goes to make up the personality thrown out of action, so that in the deepest sleep only the vital reflexes persist, and of these we are seldom actively conscious.In lighter sleep, the intellectual, rational, and controlling levels of consciousness are in abeyance, but the innate impulses and the constellations of ideas repressed into the lower levels of consciousness find expression in the form of dreams.How this withdrawal of energy takes place we do not know.Certain theories have been advanced, such as the theory of the retraction of the dendrites, but this sort of thing is necessarily purely speculative and therefore without much value.We can only accept the fact that there is such a withdrawal of energy from consciousness, and study the conditions under which it is brought about.It would seem permissible to recognize three distinct sets of conditions: (1) Sleep induced under the influence of drugs; (2) Sleep induced by fatigue; (3) Natural sleep.",

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with various quality of life concerns including poor sleep. Sleep impairments in children with AD are associated with increased risk of short stature, metabolic syndrome, mental illness and neurocognitive dysfunction. Although the association between AD and sleep disturbance is well established, the specific types of sleep disturbance in pediatric AD patients and their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. A scoping literature review was performed to characterize and summarize the types of sleep disturbance in children (less than 18 years of age) with AD. 31 papers met inclusion criteria and extracted data were analyzed in an iterative manner. Two types of sleep disturbances were found to be more prevalent in pediatric AD patients in comparison to controls. One category was related to loss of sleep (increased frequency or duration of awakenings, increased sleep fragmentation, delayed sleep onset, decreased total sleep duration, and decreased sleep efficiency). Another category was associated with unusual behaviors during sleep (restlessness/limb movement/scratching, sleep-disordered breathing including obstructive sleep apnea and snoring, nightmares, nocturnal enuresis and nocturnal hyperhidrosis). Some mechanisms underlying these sleep disturbances include pruritus and induced scratching and increased proinflammatory markers induced by sleep loss. Sleep disturbance appears to be associated with AD. We recommend clinicians to consider interventions that may reduce sleep disturbances in children with AD. Further investigation of these sleep disturbances is needed to elucidate pathophysiology, develop additional treatments, and reduce negative impacts on the health outcomes and quality of life in pediatric AD patients.",

      "title": "Human consciousness and sleep/waking rhythms: A review and some neuropsychological considerations",
      "abstract": "Abstract The relevance of sleep/waking rhythms to issues of human consciousness is reviewed from data in the literature and from personal studies. Consciousness is often considered to be markedly attenuated or absent in sleep. There is, however, much evidence for a rich subjective experience during sleep, much of which is not recalled later. This implies that William James' \"stream of consciousness\" persists continuously throughout sleep as well as wakefulness, but that problems of memory recall interfere with its being reported as such. Sleeping subjects show selective awareness of external stimuli, with significant stimuli generally leading to awakening and relatively nonsignificant stimuli, at least at times, being incorporated into the ongoing mental activity of REM or NREM sleep. Mentation throughout sleep is characterized by a high degree of autonomy and little willful control. Creative insight and problem solving of a very high order may occur in sleep and involve either dreaming or thought-like mentation. Parameters of waking consciousness show possibly sleep-related rhythmic fluctuations at both circadian (24 hr sleep/ waking) and ultradian (90–120 min, NREM/REM sleep) rates. Moreover, waking consciousness is markedly influenced by the quality of temporal stability of preceding sleep. A substantial number of so-called \"altered states of consciousness\" is found to involve primarily or exclusively dysfunction of sleep/waking mechanisms. Cerebral lesions can produce selective impairment of aspects of sleep mentation. It is concluded that further analysis of subjective awareness in sleep or in partial sleep states is very relevant and indeed vital to a more comprehensive understanding of human consciousness.",

Accurate diagnosis of RBD requires a history of abnormal sleep behaviours and nocturnal video-polysomnographic (VPSG) demonstration of prominent tonic and/or phasic electromyographic activity associated with abnormal vocal and motor manifestations in REM sleep. VPSG is required because dream-enacting behaviours resembling those typically seen in RBD may occur in people affected by obstructive sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder, visual hallucinations, isolated nightmares, confusional awakenings in demented subjects and more rarely by somnambulism and nocturnal epilepsy. Patients with Parkinson’s disease, particularly when associated with dementia, had non-RBD episodes of sleep-enactment behaviours occurring upon arousals from either REM or non-REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

(i) In typical narcolepsy, psychotic-like symptoms include predominantly visual hallucinations at the sleep-wake transition (experienced as \"not real\") and dissociation because of intrusion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena into wakefulness. (ii) Atypical patients (\"the psychotic form of narcolepsy\") experience more severe and vivid, apparently REM-related hallucinations or dream/reality confusions, which patients may rationalize in a delusion-like way. (iii) Some patients have a comorbid schizophrenia spectrum disorder with psychotic symptoms unrelated to sleep. Psychostimulants used to treat narcolepsy may trigger psychotic symptoms in all three groups. We analyzed 58 published cases from groups 2 and 3 (n = 17 and 41). Features that were reported significantly more frequently in atypical patients include visual and multimodal hallucinations, sexual and mystical delusions, and false memories. Dual diagnosis patients had more disorganized symptoms and earlier onset of narcolepsy.Epidemiological studies tentatively suggest a possible association between narcolepsy and schizophrenia only for very early-onset cases, which could be related to the partially overlapping neurodevelopmental changes observed in these disorders.

Other factors associated with aging or modifications of biological rhythms could also be involved. Elderly subjects frequently complain of daytime sleepiness, but it is not clear whether this actually represents a return to a polyphasic structure of sleep, or only a consequence of a disturbed night sleep. Ten healthy, independent and active elderly subjects (age > 72 years) were evaluated by means of 24-hour ambulatory polysomnography. Findings of nocturnal sleep were compared with sleep of the same group in the. 24-hour period and with sleep of young healthy controls. We observed a fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, but a fairly good representation of stages and a preservation of cyclicity. Except for three cases, with early or late times of sleep onset and wake-up, sleep disruption did not seem to be related to modification of circadian rhythms. Only three subjects presented undesired daytime naps, whereas the others either did not show daytime sleep at all, or were used to having their siesta after lunch since their young adulthood. In normal aging, daytime sleep does not constitute a social problem. Ambulatory polysomnography is a valid alternative to laboratory recordings in the identification of daytime sleep.Key Words: Sleepambulatory polysomnographynormal aging",

A 21-year-old female with history of depression and anxiety was evaluated for sleep terrors, sleep walking and sleep eating since age 5. Over the period of past 4 years, her sleepwalking subsided, and was substituted with hallucinations. Patient woke up with loud screams and hallucinations, “living the dream” and was able to explain it to her parents with her eyes open, who eventually “woke her up out of the episode”. Dreams were violent with “death” as the usual theme, approximately 2 hours after sleep onset with complete recollection after waking up. She also endorsed excessive daytime sleepiness with adequate sleep time on actigraphy. Patient denied history of head trauma, encephalitis, epilepsy or family history of sleep disorders. She was treated with Alprazolam and Sertraline in the past 3 years without improvement. She underwent a carefully conducted PSG and MSLT, which was negative for sleep disordered breathing or hypersomnia disorders. Extended Video EEG monitoring captured multiple stage 2 screaming and looking under the bed episodes with patient describing, “dead dogs around and under her bed”. No epileptiform activity was seen. Patient was started on Protriptyline HCL 10 MG twice daily, which resolved her symptoms. Sleep hallucinations are relatively common in teens and young adults, usually visual and reduce with aging. This case highlights an unusual presentation of hypnopompic hallucinations in stage 2, patient opening her eyes and being able to describe her hallucinations before she is “woken out of her sleep”. Differential diagnosis includes disorders of NREM sleep arousals vs. epileptiform activity. Latter was ruled out with an extended video EEG monitoring. It’s also interesting to note that her symptoms resolved with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), which was used due to failure of SSRI and benzodiazepine therapy in the past. TCA use has been described to control sleep hallucinations in narcolepsy, our case delineates their possible use in NREM hallucinations.",

      "abstract": "Dear Editor-in-ChiefSeveral scholars pointed out the relationship between the function of muscle and teeth (1). The effects of breathing on facial growth and occlusion of the bite have been identified in various papers (2, 3). A breathing disorder occurs after upper airway blockage during sleep, it has not only nighttime symptoms such as snoring or apnea but also daytime symptoms such as behavioral disorder, excessive daytime sleepiness, concentration issue, memory, and cognitive function. Sleep is a physiological phenomenon essential for performing basic human functions and is important for normal growth and development, and for maintaining emotional health and immunity. Among various sleep disorders, Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is a common medical problem for children (4). Among the sleep disorders, obstructive sleep apnea has been reported in Korean children and adolescents based on polysomnography, relative to other sleep disorders. Sleep-disordered breathing can be prevented myofunctional therapy, the neuromuscular toning and re-education of oral, facial, and pharyngeal muscles (lips, tongue, cheeks, face, and throat) through a series of activities which helps normalize the developing or developed, head and neck structures and function, with orthodontic treatment (5,6). A recent research literature review shows myofunctional therapy for those whose tongues block their airway during sleep can reduce these choking events by approximately 50% in adults and 62% in children and those lowest blood oxygen saturations, snoring, and sleepiness outcomes improve in adults (7).We now have the evidence-based studies to validate the success of treating patients collaboratively with a variety of disorders (e.g., orthodontic disorders, sleep apnea, orofacial pain) but, until recently, there were not enough studies using oral appliance and myofunctional therapy of Korean children and adolescents. Since cephalometric radiography was introduced by Broadbent to evaluate the craniofacial morphology, as recently reported (8), to evaluate the size of the airways and tongue in patients with sleep apnea, it is widely used, but, not be evaluated in three dimensions.Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a useful nondestructive method for 3D reconstruction that can be used to visualize and measure the morphological structures of hard and soft tissue on face. 3D models reconstructed from CBCT and tomographic images can display the precise anatomical structure of Oropharyngeal space. In addition, CBCT is useful for establishing realtime clinical diagnoses of patients and treatment plans (9). Programs that accurately measure complex structures of 3D models mathematically are available, but no studies have attempted to measure the Oropharyngeal space area using CBCT technology. So, our study was conducted to evaluate three dimensional changes after Myobrace (Myofunctional Research Co, Australia) appliance treatment for the children with OSAS symptoms (Fig. 1, 2). Our study confirmed the increase of oropharyneal airway dimension using Myobrace (Fig. 3). We excluded the sleep symptoms of the participating patients.Although the majority of childhood obstructive sleep apnea is due to hypertrophy of adnexaadenoid, there is no correlation between the magnitude of hypertrophy and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. …",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness. This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed.",

      "title": "Maternal Depression, Mothering and Child Development",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are abnormal behavioral or physiological events that intrude into the sleep process disrupting its continuity. Parasomnia associated to REM sleep include REM sleep behavior disorder, nightmare disorders, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (SP), and sleep-related painful erections. The quality of life of patients suffering from parasomnias may vary according to the disorder. REM sleep behavior disorder patients experience recurrent vivid and violent dreams and frequent sleep-related injuries for themselves or bed partners, with possible impacts on personal, couple, and social life. Despite the possible awakening from REM sleep, sleep architecture is usually preserved in RBD. Idiopathic RBD may often precede a neurodegenerative disease, and its diagnosis might imply a psychological burden for patients and their family. The increased risk for neurodegenerative illnesses poses the ethical dilemma whether the patient should or should not be told about, especially in view of the current lack of effective neuroprotective strategies and the lack of knowledge about the precise extent of this risk. Nightmares are intensely disturbing dreams involving a variety of dysphoric emotions, most often fear and anxiety. Nightmares have been correlated to various measures of psychopathology, namely neuroticism, anxiety, depression, but not all studies support this relationship. Personality factors, such as nightmare frequency, nightmare distress (ND), and coping style, appear to be important in modulating the clinical severity of nightmare disorder. Parasomnias, especially nightmare and SP, can lead to postawakening anxiety with difficulty returning to sleep, sleep avoidance, and sleep deprivation, with subsequent insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and intensification of the parasomnia REM-rebound related.",

Notable among these is REM sleep behavior disorder, which is closely linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson disease. Early detection of this disorder is essential because it often precedes the motor symptoms of neurodegenerative conditions. Diagnostic evaluation of parasomnias typically involves polysomnography, in some cases with video monitoring, to differentiate parasomnias from other conditions. Nonpharmacologic treatments, including sleep hygiene and sleep safety measures, are first-line approaches. Cognitive behavior therapy is also effective. Pharmacotherapy may be required in severe cases. Referral to a sleep specialist is recommended for patients with complex or dangerous parasomnias and for patients with frequent sleep paralysis.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is prevalent, causing severe distress and impairment. This review focuses on illuminating the puzzling finding that many insomnia patients misperceive their sleep. They overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) and underestimate their total sleep time (TST), relative to objective measures. This tendency is ubiquitous (although not universal). Resolving this puzzle has clinical, theoretical, and public health importance. There are implications for assessment, definition, and treatment. Moreover, solving the puzzle creates an opportunity for real-world applications of theories from clinical, perceptual, and social psychology as well as neuroscience. Herein we evaluate 13 possible resolutions to the puzzle. Specifically, we consider the possible contribution, to misperception, of (1) features inherent to the context of sleep (e.g., darkness); (2) the definition of sleep onset, which may lack sensitivity for insomnia patients; (3) insomnia being an exaggerated sleep complaint; (4) psychological distress causing magnification; (5) a deficit in time estimation ability; (6) sleep being misperceived as wake; (7) worry and selective attention toward sleep-related threats; (8) a memory bias influenced by current symptoms and emotions, a confirmation bias/belief bias, or a recall bias linked to the intensity/recency of symptoms; (9) heightened physiological arousal; (10) elevated cortical arousal; (11) the presence of brief awakenings; (12) a fault in neuronal circuitry; and (13) there being 2 insomnia subtypes (one with and one without misperception). The best supported resolutions were misperception of sleep as wake, worry, and brief awakenings. A deficit in time estimation ability was not supported. We conclude by proposing several integrative solutions.",

      "title": "Treating Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: The Counselor's Role",
      "abstract": "Each morning, five to seven million children wake up in a wet bed because of primary nocturnal enuresis, i.e., nighttime bedwetting. Because of the intense embarrassment and inconvenience associated with this behavior, many parents are highly motivated to seek help for the problem by consulting with counselors and other practitioners. This article provides the counselor background information and treatment approaches to effectively help such children and parents. Each morning in the United States five to seven million children wake up in a wet bed due to nighttime bedwetting (Warzak, 1993; Nemours Foundation, 1997). Untreated, this condition can lead to serious social and psychological problems. The medical community labels this behavior as primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) or nocturnal urinary incontinence. To qualify for a diagnoses of PNE, the voiding of urine must occur at least twice a week for at least three months, or else must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Medical authorities agree that urinary control begins around age three in the average child and that bedwetting is not considered to be a behavioral or medical problem unless it persists after the age of five (for females) or six (for males) (Warzak, 1993). Approximately 15% of children are so affected (National Enuresis Society, 1995). It should be noted that bedwetting is not considered to be a problem if it occurs only occasionally after the age three or when the child is ill. Interestingly, enuresis tends to run in families; 85% of children seen at one major enuresis clinic had a relative with enuresis and 57% had a parent or sibling with enuresis (Nemours Foundation, 1997). Two-thirds of enuretic children are male (Mikkelsen, 1988) and the problem is more common in lower socio-economic groups and among families with low educational levels (Miller, 1993). To better comprehend PNE, it is helpful to understand the normal development of bladder control. Babies normally void 12 to 16 times per day. By ages 1 to 2 they develop an awareness of a full bladder. By ages 2 to 4 the average child recognizes the sensation of voiding and develops the ability to hold-on. By ages 4 to 5 the child can initiate voiding voluntarily even before the bladder is full. Finally, the average 6 to 7 year old child can hold as necessary and void at any degree of filling (Pediatric Database, 1993). Bedwetting is then diagnosed as primary enuresis if the child is over 5 years and has never stopped bedwetting, and is referred to as secondary enuresis if the child had stopped for at least 6 months and then started again. Diurnal enuresis is the term given to bedwetting during waking hours. Primary enuresis is by far the most common type (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Research also suggests that most bedwetting stops on its own by adolescence but may persist into adulthood unless treated. (Mikkelsen, 1988). Early treatment is recommended because it can prevent the social and psychological problems that can arise if parents elect to just let him or her outgrow it. Causes of the Problem Experts disagree as to the cause of enuresis (Miller, 1993; National Enuresis Society, 1995). Medical theories, behavioral theories and psychological theories are proposed. The medical community views primary nocturnal enuresis as a problem of maturation and/or physiology (Vogel, Young and Primack, 1996). Small bladders or especially deep sleep have been blamed but research has shown that many children with PNE have normal-sized bladders and have sleep patterns that are no different from those of non-bed-wetting children (National Enuresis Society, 1995). The counseling and psychology communities treat the problem as a deficiency in self-control skills, whether caused by physiological, behavioral or cognitive components (Ronen, Rahav and Wozner, 1995) and one which is often aggravated by social reactions toward the child (Mala, 1995). …",

      "abstract": "Insomnia complaints increase with age and are frequently made by elderly people. Recently non-pharmacological treatments have been proposed more often, among which stimulus control. One of the stimulus control instructions is the advice not to nap in the daytime, based on the assumption that napping affects sleep quality the following night, due to a decrease of sleep need. This article discusses the function of napping and the impact of napping on sleep. The decline of sleep duration during aging is not due to a disturbance of the endogenous circadian rhythm but rather to a decrease of the physiological sleep need. Naps do not have the function to compensate for the decreased sleep duration but to meet an increased psychological sleep need. During daytime elderly people are physiologically less sleepy than young adults, who, nevertheless, sleep on average longer. Napping does not negatively affect sleep. Consequently, the assumption on which the advice against napping is based is wrong.",

      "title": "[Sleep disorders in childhood].",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders in childhood are frequent and usually harmless. They rarely point to a serious disease. Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders, it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g. psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).",

The bidirectional association between sleep and headache is mediated by a temporal link (headache occurs during sleep, after sleep, and in relationship with sleep stages), by a quantitative relationship (excess, lack, bad quality, short duration of sleep may trigger headache), and by a reciprocal connection (headache may cause sleep disruption and may be associated with several sleep disturbances). This association is most evident for primary headache disorders, especially in childhood. A congenital alteration of neurotransmitter pathways (serotoninergic and dopaminergic) might predispose individuals to both disorders, presenting as sleep–wake rhythm disorder in infancy or as headache disorder later in childhood, as result of this neurotransmitter imbalance. Clinicians should be aware that a complete clinical evaluation of childhood headache includes a careful sleep history, taking into account that the treatment of sleep disturbances could lead to an improvement of headache symptoms and vice versa.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common and affect sleep quality and quantity, leading to increased morbidity. Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized as those who cannot sleep, those who will not sleep, those with excessive daytime sleepiness, and those with increased movements during sleep. Insomnia, defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that results in daytime impairment, is diagnosed using history findings and treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without sleep hypnotics. Restless legs syndrome is characterized by an urge to move the legs that worsens with rest, is relieved by movement, and often occurs in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome is treated based on the frequency of symptoms. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. It is diagnosed using a sleep log or actigraphy, followed by overnight polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test. Narcolepsy is treated with stimulants, such as modafinil; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; or gamma hydroxybutyric acid (sodium oxybate). Patients with snoring and witnessed apneas may have obstructive sleep apnea, which is diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Continuous positive airway pressure is the most common and effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in the patient acting out dreams with possible harmful consequences. It is diagnosed based on history and polysomnography findings, and treated with environmental safety measures and melatonin or clonazepam.",

This disorder of arousal is much more common in children than in adults, and it is commonly associated with other parasomnias. Sleepwalking typically occurs during the first three hours of sleep, when sleep stages 3 and 4 (non-rapid-eye-movement sleep) are most prevalent. The episodes usually last 30 seconds to 30 minutes. The differential diagnosis of sleepwalking includes partial complex seizures occurring during sleep, rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder, night terrors, malingering, dissociative phenomena and medication effects. The treatment of sleepwalking in children includes providing a regular sleep-wake schedule, ensuring that the child has sufficient sleep and reassuring the parents.

      "title": "1097 Pathologic Lucid Dreams in a Patient with Fibromyalgia: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Recurrent lucid dreaming is unusual and may be associated with an underlying sleep disorder. These are clear, emotionally pleasant dreams where the person is aware they are dreaming and capable of controlling content. They are usually initiated from REM sleep, but without loss of atonia. However, pathologic lucid dreams are associated with negative content and can result in sleep disruption with excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue. The etiology is unknown and we present a case of pathologic lucid dreams occurring after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. A 58-year-old man presents with complaints of sleep fragmentation beginning 15 years earlier since he was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. He experienced lucid dreaming since young adulthood without negative symptoms. Since his fibromyalgia, he complains of frequent purposeful awakening from his dreams due to unpleasant content and difficulty controlling them. He now feels as if he is awake throughout the night and has excess daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography showed increased REM and absent slow wave sleep without obstructive sleep apnea, REM behavior disorder or abnormal movements, or seizures. Treatment for fibromyalgia included various opiates, antidepressants, and pregabalin without improvement in sleep. We initiated prazosin and very low dose methadone, which resulted in improvement sleep fragmentation, tolerance to dream content, and frequency of dreams. Additionally, he had improved daytime function, decreased pain and daytime sleepiness. Lucid dreams are unusual, but are considered normal. However, pathologic lucid dreams are abnormal. The etiology and prevalence are unknown. Patients may be misdiagnosed with nightmares or hypersomnia with possible narcolepsy. Because he responded to prazosin and methadone treatment, we hypothesize that increased hypersensitivity of the monoaminergic system secondary to uncontrolled fibromyalgia may have been the reason behind these pathologic lucid dreams.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent at menopausal transition and substantially affect the quality of life in midlife women. Diagnosing and treating sleep disturbances are essential parts of the management of menopausal symptoms. Persistent insomnia in midlife is not a single entity, and is not always linked with menopause per se. Detailed patient history supplemented with appropriate physical examination and diagnostic tests is the basis for correct diagnosis. Insomnia in midlife women can be divided into four major categories: (1) menopausal insomnia (often related to climacteric vasomotor symptoms); (2) primary (psychophysiologic) insomnia; (3) secondary insomnia (associated with other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing), mental (e.g., anxiety or depression) or medical (e.g., fibromyalgia) disorders or aging; and (4) insomnia induced by behavioral, environmental, or psychosocial factors. Careful evaluation of the nature of the menopausal insomnia will help choosing the best therapy for each individual. Treatment options for menopause-associated insomnia include hormone therapy, behavioral interventions as well as medication targeting the specific underlying medical condition (such as pain, anxiety, or depression). Conventional hypnotic agents rarely provide long-term benefit in chronic forms of insomnia. This chapter provides a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment of menopausal insomnia.",

Respiratory dysfunction in sleep is common in persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI), occurring at a significantly higher rate than in the general population. Regulation of sleep is mediated by opposing actions of the anterior and posterior/lateral regions of the hypothalamus. Insomnia is characterized as difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep, awakening in morning, or non-restorative sleep. The negative effects of shift work include sleepiness and insomnia, reduced alertness, and greater risk of re-injury, overall poor health, low work productivity, and poor quality of life. The sleep diary has been used in the TBI population for assessing sleep quality and quantity, and for identifying factors that may affect sleep and wakefulness.

Few studies have been made of this and above all there are no guide lines or suggestions as to how to treat these problems. The difficulty is made worse by the different characteristics of the insomnia and of the affected children themselves. Poor sleeping is associated with other pathology of the patient (mental retardation, convulsions, etc.).We have revised the different modes of treatment, particularly pharmacological, which are available today. Guidelines as to how to handle this symptom are suggested. We also include a list of some drug reactions which may cause symptoms related to sleep (insomnia, excessive sleepiness or nightmares).",

      "abstract": "Nocturia, waking up at night to urinate, is a highly prevalent disorder in the elderly with a profound impact on life expectancy, health and quality of life. It interacts negatively with sleep and is associated with increased daytime sleepiness. In particular, waking up three or more times a night to void is related to a steep increase in sleep disturbances. Giddiness, both at night and during the day, is another common consequence, since in three out of four cases, nocturia can be attributed to nocturnal urine overproduction, causing a negative fluid balance. Fall injuries are the most important risk associated with nocturia. Nocturia may be attributable not only to nocturnal polyuria, but also to a diminished nocturnal bladder capacity, or both. Treatment may include diuretics (taken in the afternoon instead of in the morning), vasopressin analogs (desmopressin) at bedtime or antimuscarinic drugs to improve nocturnal bladder capacity.",

If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

      "title": "Dynamics of recovery sleep from chronic sleep restriction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep loss is common in our 24/7 society with many people routinely sleeping less than they need. Sleep debt is a term describing the difference between the amount of sleep needed, and the amount of sleep obtained. Sleep debt can accumulate over time, resulting in poor cognitive performance, increased sleepiness, poor mood, and a higher risk for accidents. Over the last 30 years, the sleep field has increasingly focused attention on recovery sleep and the ways we can recover from a sleep debt faster and more effectively. While there are still many unanswered questions and debates about the nature of recovery sleep, such as the exact components of sleep important for recovery of function, the amount of sleep needed to recover and the impacts of prior sleep history on recovery, recent research has revealed several important attributes about recovery sleep: (1) the dynamics of the recovery process is impacted by the type of sleep loss (acute versus chronic), (2) mood, sleepiness, and other aspects of cognitive performance recover at different rates, and (3) the recovery process is complex and dependent on the length of recovery sleep and the number of recovery opportunities available. This review will summarize the current state of the literature on recovery sleep, from specific studies of recovery sleep dynamics to napping, “banking” sleep and shiftwork, and will suggest the next steps for research in this field.

      "title": "Sleep-disordered Breathing in Neuromuscular Disease",
      "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular diseases is due to an exaggerated reduction in lung volumes during supine sleep, a compromised physiologic adaptation to sleep, and specific features of the diseases that may promote upper airway collapse or heart failure. The normal decrease in the rib cage contribution to the tidal volume during phasic REM sleep becomes a critical vulnerability, resulting in saw-tooth oxygen desaturation possibly representing the earliest manifestation of respiratory muscle weakness. Hypoventilation can occur in REM sleep and progress into non-REM sleep, with continuous desaturation and hypercarbia. Specific characteristics of neuromuscular disorders, such as pharyngeal neuropathy or weakness, macroglossia, bulbar manifestations, or low lung volumes, predispose patients to the development of obstructive events. Central sleep-disordered breathing can occur with associated cardiomyopathy (e.g., dystrophies) or from instability in the control of breathing due to diaphragm weakness. Mitigating factors such as recruitment of accessory respiratory muscles, reduction in REM sleep, and loss of normal REM atonia in some individuals may partially protect against sleep-disordered breathing. Noninvasive ventilation, a standard-of-care management option for sleep-disordered breathing, can itself trigger specific sleep-disordered breathing events including air leaks, patient-ventilator asynchrony, central sleep apnea, and glottic closure. These events increase arousals, reduce adherence, and impair sleep architecture. Polysomnography plays an important role in addressing pitfalls in the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular diseases, identifying sleep-disordered breathing triggered by noninvasive ventilation, and optimizing noninvasive ventilation settings.",

      "title": "Excessive Sleepiness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Persons are considered excessively sleepy if they are unable to consistently achieve and sustain wakefulness and alertness to accomplish the tasks of daily living. Sleep occurs unintentionally or at inappropriate times or places. In children, sleepiness may manifest as hyperactivity. Excessive sleepiness can be defined using either clinical or Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) criteria, namely hypersomnolence occurring almost daily for at least 3 months, and mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, respectively. Although the likelihood of falling asleep is greater during inactive monotonous situations, severe sleepiness can manifest precipitously as sleep attacks, recurrent episodes of microsleep, or automatic behavior during which there is no memory of semiconscious activities. It is important to distinguish excessive sleepiness from fatigue, exhaustion, tiredness, weariness, listlessness or weakness, which may closely mimic it. Excessive sleepiness is estimated to affect 5% of the general population. Occasional excessive daytime sleepiness may be present in up to a third of the general adult population. Prevalence is greater among adolescents and older adults. Both genders appear to be affected equally. Among young adults, hours of weekday sleep predict daytime sleepiness, as do snoring, depression, marital status (those who are single are more likely to develop daytime sleepiness than married individuals), and employment status (sleepiness is more prevalent among persons employed full-time compared with those who are employed part-time or unemployed).",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders have reached epidemic rates in the modern world. It is important to note that they can affect children as well as adults. Sleep is of the utmost importance for the maintenance of body homeostasis. Many disease processes affecting sleep have been associated with numerous symptoms, including cognitive impairment, fatigue as well as a wide range of behavioral, hormonal and metabolic derangements. Sleep disorders in childhood can be classified by age of incidence (in infants, toddlers, school-age children or adolescents) and by the exact nature of the symptoms. They are classified in insomnias, hypersomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm disorders and respiratory disorders which affect sleep. Parasomnias are the most common sleep disorders in toddlers, with night terrors, nightmares and sleepwalking being the most common. Respiratory disorders are the most important in older children, especially obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. All sleep disorders are clinically manifested with symptoms of sleep deprivation. Their management always involves improvement of sleep hygiene, though in some cases (such as obstructive sleep apnea) specific medical treatment is also available and warranted. A three-way relationship of trust, compassion and cooperation between child, family and healthcare professional is a prerequisite for the effective management of childhood sleep disorders. Nursing staff are the main factor cultivating that relationship in the context of inpatient care.",

      "abstract": "Nocturia, the need to awaken at night to void, is a highly prevalent disorder that negatively affects nocturnal sleep, increases daytime tiredness, and adversely impacts quality of life. In this selective review, we provide the reader an overview of current work in this area. From the perspective of disturbed sleep, two divergent perspectives have emerged from the literature when discussing nocturia. The first is that a patient awakens because of an urge to urinate. The second is that a patient awakens during the night for some reason unrelated to urinary urge (e.g., an awakening from an environmental source or from intrinsic lightening of sleep) and then decides to void while awake. In the few studies that have inquired about nocturia as a cause of awakenings, nocturia often ranks above the traditional psychological or physical factors. Not only is nocturia likely to disrupt sleep, but it may impact waking quality of life as well. A number of generic and nocturia‐related questionnaires have been used to quantify the effect of nocturia on quality of life. In this short paper, we introduce the reader to several key studies in these important areas. Neurourol. Urodynam. 33:S15–S18, 2014 . © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

There may be other, quite different, causes at this age, requiring special advice or treatment. Mayth: Many teenagers do not go to sleep until late and are difficult to get up in the morning, as well as lying in bed at weekends until very late, because of bad habits.This is not necessarily the case.

      "title": "Sleep and the Athlete",
      "abstract": "Adequate sleep hygiene is increasingly recognized as a crucial part of athlete recovery, avoidance of overtraining or burnout, and optimization of health. Sleep impacts metabolic regulation and homeostasis and serves a vital restorative function (1). Sleep regulation occurs through an intrinsic sleep-wake cycle of optimal duration, coupled with a circadian rhythm that is influenced by environmental exposures, such as light and darkness. Other factors that affect sleep include exercise, diet/nutrition, supplements/stimulants, medications, travel, social/electronic media, and mental/physical health (2–4). In general, exercise favorably affects sleep quality and quantity (5). High-performance athletes, particularly adolescent and young adult athletes, are routinely exposed to greater physical, psychological, and neuromuscular stressors that require a delicate balance of recovery, including appropriate sleep (5). Athletes are at higher risk for sleep impairment for several reasons. Sleep deprivation is the most common sleep disorder, in general (6,7), and the frequency of both early morning and/or evening training sessions can decrease sleep duration, resulting in acute and cumulative sleep deprivation. A minimum of 7 h of sleep per day is ideal for optimal health in adults; adolescents require a minimum of 8 h of sleep per day (6,7) (Table). Traveling across time zones for competitions can have negative effects on circadian rhythms, particularly west to east travel. In general, it is prudent to allow at least 1 d for each time zone crossed for full resolution of jet lag symptoms (8,9). Additional studies have shown that between 50% and 80% of all athletes experience poor sleep quality during periods of heavy training and particularly on the nights before and after competition (5,10–12). Poor sleep quality and quantity can negatively affect cognitive and physical performance, perceived exertion, injury risk, and mental health (2–4). All of the above, along with increased pain, decreased task execution tolerance, and decreased cognitive and motor function (e.g., increased reaction times), are consistently correlated with increased injury risk in athletes (13–16). Daytime restorative napping, a common strategy that can reduce sleep debt, can improve short-term memory, alertness, and accuracy during reaction-time tests and should be incorporated, when necessary. Other sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent bedtimes, avoiding evening light exposure from technology and electronic devices, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining adequate hydration, and having a relaxation-focused bedtime routine (17,18).Table: National Sleep Foundation Sleep Duration Recommendations byAge (23).Athletes with mental health disorders and sport-related concussion (SRC) often display symptoms of disordered sleep. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in concussed athletes with up to 50% reporting sleep-related issues, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and impaired sleep quality. Sleep disturbance may hinder concussion recovery and can worsen psychiatric illness, memory, and social functioning (19). Unfortunately, inadequate sleep the night before neurocognitive concussion testing can lead to increased symptom scores, impeding return to play (20). Sleep quality and mental health impact each other (21). Sleep impairment can lead to increased stress, negative mood, and exacerbation of mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Conversely, the presence of mental illness can cause sleep disturbances. Optimizing sleep appears to improve overall mental health (21,22). Compensatory strategies, restorative approaches, and cognitive rehabilitation should be incorporated into comprehensive treatment plans for SRC patients and athletes with mental health disorders. Good sleep hygiene that includes adequate sleep duration, quality, and timing appears to be a crucial factor in athlete health, performance, adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention. Athletes must increase their awareness of sleep importance and develop strategies to maintain proper sleep regulation throughout training and competition.",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli. The specific problems of children and adolescents (aged 13 to 17) with sacro-lumbar myelomeningocele have been discussed on the basic of a pilot study conducted at the hospital in Radziszów in the years 1996-1998.",

Although certain epilepsy syndromes, such as infantile spasms, are associated with mental retardation or progressive intellectual decline, others typically are associated with normal development. Children who have \"absence\" attacks, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and benign Rolandic seizures, for example, generally are not impaired cognitively. When children are intellectually normal prior to the onset of epilepsy, intellectual decline is rare regardless of the number of seizures.",

      "abstract": "Millions of patients are afflicted by a variety of sleep disorders. Sleep can be measured electrophysiologically and described in terms of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, with REM sleep being dream sleep. Overall, sleep is a cyclic phenomenon, showing a 90-minute periodicity. Sleep disorders are divided into four groups: disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep, disorders of excessive somnolence, disorders of the sleep-wake schedule, and the parasomnias. The parasomnias include sleepwalking, sleep terror, and nightmares. The classic disorders of excessive somnolence include obstructive sleep apnea (an impairment of respiratory function during sleep) and narcolepsy (a genetically transmitted dysregulation of REM sleep). Insomnia may be either transient (eg, associated with jet lag, work shift change, or a disturbing or exciting situation) or chronic (eg, associated with psychiatric disorders or periodic leg movements during sleep). Hypnotics are generally reserved for the treatment of transient or short-term insomnias. Although a number of hypnotics are available, the benzodiazepines are currently accepted as the drugs of choice; selection within the group is based primarily on differences in pharmacokinetic profiles. The practicing pharmacist has the opportunity to play an important role in assessing, recommending treatment, or recommending further evaluation for the many patients who present with insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Infusions of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) are often cycled at night coinciding with sleep episodes. Adult consumers of HPN are known to experience poor sleep attributed to frequent awakenings and long durations of wakefulness after falling asleep. Consequently, most consumers do not meet recommendations for sleep duration and quality or daytime napping. The primary underlying pathophysiology resulting in sleep problems is nocturia; however, other factors also exist, including disruptions caused by medical equipment (ie, pump alarms), comorbid conditions, dysglycemia, and medication use. Early guidance on sleep is imperative because of the central role of sleep in physical health and wellbeing, including mitigating complications, such as infection risk, gastrointestinal problems, pain sensitivity, and fatigue. Clinicians should routinely inquire about the sleep of their patients and address factors known to perturb sleep. Nonpharmacologic opportunities to mitigate sleep problems include education on healthy sleep practices (ie, sleep hygiene); changes in infusion schedules, volumes, rates, and equipment; and, possibly, behavioral interventions, which have yet to be examined in this population. Addressing comorbid conditions, such as mood disorders, and nutrition deficiencies may also help. Pharmacologic interventions and technological advancement in HPN delivery are also needed. Research on sleep in this population is considered a priority, yet it remains limited at this time.",

For example, sleep apnea in adults affects men more than women, is more prevalent in the obese, and presents with symptoms of snoring and excessive somnolence. In preadolescent children, sleep apnea affects both sexes equally, is more closely correlated with adenotonsillar enlargement than obesity, and may be more likely to present with daytime inattention and learning problems rather than frank somnolence. Likewise, the insomnia and associated bedtime struggles of a 3-year-old bear little resemblance to the insomnia of a mature adult apart from the fact that both individuals are unable to easily fall asleep. Sleep disorders in children are reviewed with particular focus on age-related changes in normal sleep and on sleep disorders that primarily or exclusively affect children. Pediatric aspects of other sleep disorders will be reviewed in more limited detail, with examination of how age, developmental level, and comorbid conditions cause clinical presentation and treatment to differ from that of adults.",

The bizarre features of dreams may be divided into three broad categories: discontinuities, incongruities and uncertainties. Discontinuities are interruptions in orientational stability; incongruities are inappropriate syntheses of mismatching plot elements; uncertainties are confusions of distinct conceptions. Dream bizarreness appears to be the manifestation of some state-dependent cognitive process which is probably rooted in REM sleep neurophysiology. In the waking state, our brain/minds are capable of remaining focused on the normal flow of ongoing information, and such features of life as plot and time unfold in a linear sequence. In REM sleep/dreaming, this function appears to be interfered with, and disparate elements of consciousness are suddenly interjected as the brain/mind cannot maintain its orientational focus in the usual way.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders: Disorders of Arousal?",
      "abstract": "In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism, the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues, overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date, it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.",

Insomnia can be classified based on how long it lasts. Acute insomnia is a type of insomnia that lasts only a few hours and is caused by a variety of factors. Many people have had this form of temporary sleep disruption, which usually goes away without medication. Chronic insomnia is defined as sleep disruption that lasts at least three months and occurs at least three evenings per week. Insomnia can be caused by a variety of factors. Insomnia is caused by a misalignment of sleep-inducing neurotransmitters. The Insomnia Severity Index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index are two methodologies and indices that have been used to research sleep disturbances in insomnia sufferers.

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is a chronic and debilitating illness. In this article, we present an algorithm of the diagnosis and treatment of the illness. We place much importance upon the patient variables associated with the treatment decisions. We emphasize strong patient involvement in treatment as a way to become panic free and improve level of functioning. Panic disorder is defined in DSM-IV1 as \"The presence of recurrent panic attacks followed by at least one month of persistent concern about having another panic attack, worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attack, or a significant behavioral change related to the attacks.\" A panic attack is defined as \"a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which four or more of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes.\" 1) Palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate; 2) sweating; 3) trembling or shaking; 4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; 5) feeling of choking; 6) chest pain or discomfort; 7) nausea or abdominal distress; 8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed or faint; 9) derealization or depersonalization; 10) fear of losing control or going crazy; 11) fear of dying; 12) paresthesias; 13) chills or hot flashes. The following hypotheses have been used to conceptualize panic disorder from a psychiatrist's perspective.",

Inadequate sleep, either in duration or quality, and altered sleep-wake cycles are common reports in palliative care. The causes for insomnia in palliative care may be related to psychological factors (anxiety or depression), pain, treatment-related toxicity, or other comorbid medical conditions. Untreated insomnia can lead to daytime sleepiness, irritability, depressive or anxious mood, and accidents. Assessment, prevention, and management are addressed. The chapter includes discussion regarding sleep hygiene, the role of exercise, and the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Education of patients and their family members is imperative to address this syndrome.",

SW, CA and ST are different clinical manifestations of the same disorder being ST the most severe and SW the mildest manifestation. Disorders of arousal are typical parasomnias of NREM sleep, mainly slow wave sleep. Pathophysiological mechanism of these disorders is the state's dissociation of wakefulness and sleep. The conjunction of the constitutional factors (genetic, age, sleep privation, drugs, psychological, etc.), and precipitant factors (light, sound, temperature, touch, apnea, gastroesophageal reflux, seizure, fever, psychological, etc.) permit three possible arousal behavioral response: A full awakening, a shift stage of sleep or a partial arousal. Clinical significance of arousal parasomnias depend on the age. In children are caused by developmental and genetic factors and usually are autolimited. In adults usually are caused by psychopathology. In the elderly are often caused by organic brain syndromes. Parasomnias of sleep-wake transition are: Rhythmic movements of sleep, sleeptalking, starts and the nocturnal cramp. Most of them are mild disorders, almost physiological phenomena that usually don't need any treatment.",

      "abstract": ". Istirahat dan tidur merupakan kebutuhan dasar yang dibutuhkan oleh semua\r\norang. Setiap orang memerlukan kebutuhan istirahat atau tidur yang cukup agar\r\ntubuh dapat berfungsi secara normal (Wicaksono, 2012). Tidur merupakan salah\r\nsatu fungsi biologis yang berperan penting dalam status kesehatan individu.\r\nSebagian individu mengalami masalah dengan tidurnya, dimana gangguan tidur\r\nyang sering terjadi salah satunya adalah insomnia (Putri dan Bayhakki, 2016).\r\nDi Indonesia, belum diketahui angka pastinya namun prevalensi pada orang\r\ndewasa mencapai 20% (Wicaksono, 2012). Insomnia merupakan keadaan tidak\r\ndapat tidur atau terganggunya pola tidur. Orang yang bersangkutan mungkin tidak\r\ndapat tidur, sukar untuk jatuh tidur, atau mudah terbangun dan kemudian tidak\r\ndapat tidur lagi. Insomnia umumnya merupakan kondisi sementara atau jangka\r\npendek. Dalam beberapa kasus, insomnia dapat menjadi kronis. Hal ini sering\r\ndisebut sebagai gangguan tidur yang paling sering terjadi yang berhubungan\r\ndengan situasional stres akut, seperti pekerjaan baru atau menjelang ujian.\r\nInsomnia ini biasanya hilang ketika stressor hilang atau individu telah beradaptasi\r\ndengan stressor. Namun, insomnia sementara sering berulang ketika tegangan\r\nbaru atau serupa muncul dalam kehidupan pasien (Kaplan dan Sadock, 2010).\r\nDalam TCM, insomnia yang diakibatkan sindrom hiperaktivitas Yang karena\r\ndefisiensi Yin disebabkan karena kebiasaan makan manis sehingga terjadi panas\r\npada lambung yang dapat mengganggu fungsi transformasi dan transportasi limpa.\r\nDisamping itu, insomnia juga disebabkan karena suka berpikir. Berpikir yang\r\nmelampaui batas mengakibatkan peredaran Qi terhalang dan fungsi transportasi\r\ndan transformasi Pi-limpa tidak berjalan dengan normal. Organ lambung yang\r\nekses dan organ limpa yang defisiensi (unsur tanah) tidak dapat membatasi organ\r\nginjal sehingga menyebabkan defisiensi Yin pada organ ginjal. Dengan adanya\r\ndefisiensi Yin ginjal menyebabkan Yin ginjal tidak dapat menguap ke atas untuk\r\nmembatasi Yang Qi jantung. Karena Yin ginjal tidak dapat membatasi Yang Qi\r\njantung menyebabkan terjadinya hiperaktivitas api jantung. Saat api jantung\r\nterganggu, Shen-jiwa ikut terganggu menyebabkan terjadinya insomnia.\r\nPenanganan yang dilakukan pada penderita insomnia yaitu terapi akupresur\r\ndan terapi herbal. Terapi akupresur dilakukan pada titik Neiguan (PC6), Shenmen\r\n(HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) dilakukan sebanyak 12 kali terapi yang diberikan\r\nsebanyak 3 kali dalam seminggu. Serta terapi herbal setiap hari selama 28 hari\r\ndengan menggunakan simplisia daun putri malu (Mimosa pudica) dengan dosis 10\r\ngram yang direbus dengan 750 mL air, diminum sehari 1 kali sebanyak 200 mL\r\nsebelum tidur.\r\nDari hasil setelah pemberian terapi kombinasi akupresur pada titik Neiguan\r\n(PC6), Shenmen (HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) serta pemberian herbal putri malu\r\n(Mimosa pudica) dapat memberikan hasil yang baik terhadap pasien dengan\r\nkeluhan insomnia. Pasien merasa lebih tenang, relaks, dan pasien merasa mudah\r\nmengantuk pada malam hari.",

      "title": "Melatonin: helping to MEND impaired sleep",
      "abstract": "Many neurodevelopmental disorders adversely affect sleep; children often have difficulty in falling asleep, wake up more often during the night, and sleep less than their typically developing peers. ‘Sleep problems’ were found in 53% of over 300 children with autism, compared with 44% of 63 children with delayed development, and 32% of 163 children with normal (typical) development.1 Sleep problems arise from complex interactions between biological, psychological, social, family and cultural factors. Circadian sleep rhythm disorders (CSRD) may be acute but are more often chronic, and frequently result in associated health problems. CSRDs usually exacerbate any pre-existing learning and behavioural difficulties, and may affect the entire family's whole health and well-being and impair their ability to continue in employment or further education.\n\nThere is considerable pressure for both parents and paediatricians to try and improve a child's disturbed sleep. Management options include behavioural, or pharmacological, or both. Behavioural interventions are probably undervalued, but may be difficult to implement, and may take weeks or months to show any benefit. Conventional medications including hypnotics and sedatives are frequently associated with unacceptable day-time sedation that may adversely affect the child's quality of life. The past 20 years have witnessed the introduction of melatonin which continues to be increasingly prescribed to many children both with and without neurodevelopmental disorders and using a wide range of doses. To many, it is the ubiquitous safe solution to any ‘sleep problem’. The popularity of melatonin reflects the …",

Nowadays, it is a wider spread opinion that 10% of the live born children belong to the group of those with neurodevelopment risks or that were under influence of other factors (medical history, clinical), which can lead to the early brain damage. Risk factors can be divided into perinatal, prenatal and postnatal ; and the worst effect of all have: premature birth - before the 32nd week of gestation ; low birth weight - less than 1500 grams ; machine breathing longer than 48 hours in the first 28 days of life ; cardio - respiratory collapse at birth including: Apgar score of 0– 3 in the fifth minute of life, inability to establish spontaneous respiration within the first 10 minutes and lasting muscle hypotonia during the first 2 hours of life ; prolonged perinatal hypoxemia ; acidemia ; neonatal hypoglycemia or recurrent apnea ; a history of epileptic seizures ; disturbances of consciousness of the newborn ; other potential neurological problems, such as previous CNS infection ; documented sepsis ; meningitis ; pathologic Hyperbilirubinemia, so called “Complicated” intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed by ultrasound (all except first degree) ; hypoxic - ischemic changes ; periventricular leucomalacia ; hydrocephalus and other congenital malformation ; and viral and other infection of the mother in the first weeks of pregnancy. With objective to prevent an easier neuromotor deviation and difficulties with basic life function to become dominant, stereotypical and habit of the child, physiotherapy intervention in the NICU is performed. It includes the proper positioning of the newborn, respiratory physiotherapy, early neurodevelopmental therapy, neonatal handling, preoral therapy and parent education. Although it is a small child it is important to have an holistic interdisciplinary team approach that focuses on the child as a whole and includes all professional disciplines and their existing knowledge in solving problems of the small patient. In the NICU, the basis of the team which take care of neurodevelopment risky infants are the physiotherapist, the neonatologist physician and the nurse.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability (1, 2). Sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, are very common following traumatic brain injury and have been reported in frequencies from 40% (3) to as high as 84% (4). Sleep disruption can be related to the TBI itself but may also be secondary to neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression) or neuromuscular (e.g., pain) conditions associated with TBI or to the pharmacological management of the injury and its consequences. Post-TBI insomnia has been associated with numerous negative outcomes including daytime fatigue, tiredness, difficulty functioning: impaired performance at work, memory problems, mood problems, greater functional disability, reduced participation in activities of daily living, less social and recreational activity, less employment potential, increased caregiver burden, greater sexual dysfunction, and also lower ratings of health, poor subjective wellbeing. These negative consequences can hamper the person’s reintegration into the community, adjustment after injury, and overall QOL. (5) The connection between depression and insomnia has not been investigated within the post TBI population to a great extent. For the general population, clinically significant insomnia is often associated with the presence of an emotional disorder (6). Fichtenberg et al. (2002) (7), in his study established that the strongest relationship with the diagnosis of insomnia belonged to depression. Given the high prevalence of depression during the first 2 years following TBI (8), a link between depression and insomnia among TBI patients makes innate sense. The present study aims at assessing role of sertralline in post TBI insomnia associated with depression.",

So much is this the case that often this explanation of your difficulties gets overlooked instead of being dealt with. Many people know they do not sleep well, although many do not ask for help and soldier on as best they can. Others are less aware that their sleep is unsatisfactory and that they could benefit if their sleep was improved. Ideally, a person’s sleep at night should be both long enough (adequate sleep) and also of sufficiently good quality to restore them, so that they feel well and can function properly during the day. Good-quality sleep means that sleep is sound and unbroken. In addition, sleep quality can be impaired (also called ‘fragmented’ sleep) by very brief arousals without you consciously waking up. This happens particularly in later life and in various sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (see Chapter 9), causing daytime sleepiness.",

The differential diagnosis of sleep related injury and violence includes: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD); NREM sleep parasomnias (sleepwalking, sleep terrors); parasomnia overlap disorder (RBD + NREM sleep parasomnias); obstructive sleep apnea; sexsomnia (sleep related abnormal sexual behaviors); sleep related dissociative disorder; trauma-associated sleep disorder/post-traumatic stress disorder; periodic limb movement disorder; rhythmic movement disorder; nocturnal scratching disorder; nocturnal seizures; and miscellaneous/mixed conditions. Careful clinical interviews, preferably with bed partners participating, and extensive, hospital-based, technologist-attended, overnight video-polysomnography (for one or more nights), is crucial for determining the accurate diagnosis that will guide proper therapy. Most of the disorders mentioned above are classified as parasomnias in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition, with parasomnias defined as abnormal behavioral, experiential and/or autonomic nervous system activity during entry into sleep, during any stage of sleep, and during emergence from any stage of sleep. Parasomnias are often manifestations of \"state dissociation\" in which components of one state of being (wake, REM sleep, NREM sleep) intrude into, and become admixed, with other states of being, with clinical consequences. There are forensic implications related to the parasomnias, with inadvertent and unintentional assaults, murder, and \"pseudo-suicide\" resulting from aggressive and violent behaviors arising from sleep with suspended awareness and judgement.",

Many classifications can be used, such as classifications related to the location of the lesion or classifications related to the clinical presentations. The latter have the advantage of enticing the practitioner to systematically evaluate specific sleep disorders. Such classifications include neurodegenerative disorders, neuromuscular disorders, movement disorders, autoimmune disorders, cerebrovascular diseases, seizures, and headaches. The manifestations in terms of their impact on sleep often depend, of course, on the location of the lesion. Some neurologic diseases involve the sleep-wake system. For example, dementing disorders may affect diffuse neural pathways that impact the strength of the circadian rhythm, but also instability of sleep and sleep states. In contrast, other disorders secondarily impact sleep and its quality. As an example, neuromuscular disorders can impact control of swallowing and the airway, which can increase susceptibility to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are both common and consequential, but too often remain undiagnosed. The insidious, chronic course of most sleep disorders and lack of patient awareness of signs and symptoms during sleep can complicate the clinical evaluation. Typical chief complaints include snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and behaviors during sleep. Sleep disorders can be primary or secondary to medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is often desirable. Family members can be a critical source of information as they may have observed nocturnal or daytime symptoms unrecognized by the patient. Objective testing plays an important role in assessment for obstructive sleep apnea, parasomnias, and other specific sleep disorders, and can be used most effectively in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation. Nonsleep specialists should consider obtaining assistance from sleep clinicians for more challenging presentations or management of sleep disorders unfamiliar to them.",

      "title": "Understanding the pathophysiology of insomnia (Anidra) with special reference to primary insomnia using neurotransmitter sleep theories: a narrative review",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a primordial requirement for human sustenance and its role in health is inevitable. Despite its importance, inadequate sleep is one of the most common complaints across the globe. Ayurveda identifies Nidra (sleep) as one of the three supporting pillars of life and attributes its maintenance not only to health but also to longevity and prosperity; in contrast, Anidra (disturbed sleep) is one of the contributing factors for disease. Ayurveda clearly identifies the factors in Anidra which are vitiation of Pitta or Vata (fundamental humors of the body), Manasantapa (psycho-social stress), Kshaya (debilitating factors), or Abhighata (injury/trauma). Insomnia is characterized by reduced quality or quantity of sleep and has effects on the quality of life of the affected individual. It can be the difficulty of sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening, which can have a significant impact on the daily activity of the individual. The contemporary science is yet to give a definite theory for the physiology of sleep and the pathophysiology of insomnia. The most widely accepted and researched concept is the role of neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, melatonin and their effects in the regulation of sleep–wake cycle. These neurotransmitters and their effect on sleep physiology and pathology of insomnia need to be further explored in order to improve its management strategies. Hence, this review aims to determine the possible relation between the concepts of Nidra (sleep) and Anidra (disturbed sleep) mentioned in Ayurveda and these neurotransmitter sleep theories. This will help in improving the understanding of the pathophysiology of insomnia, developing Ayurveda management protocols for insomnia, and also in explaining the pharmacodynamics of Ayurveda drugs better. The method used for review is by sourcing and analyzing the available data from Ayurveda and contemporary literature on the topic in discussion.",

Polysomnography, motor activity monitoring of rest-activity cycles, plasma melatonin profiles and urinary melatonin metabolite excretion are normal. Different patterns of sleep phase delay seen in the syndrome include stable, progressive, irregular and non-24 hour sleep-wake cycles. These patterns may result from different social and other Zeitgebers (\"time-markers\", for example sunrise, sunset) in the normal environment.

      "title": "854 Sexsomnia in a Divorce Proceeding and its Custody Implications",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sexsomnia is a NREM parasomnia under the subtype of Confusional Arousals, defined as abnormal sexual behaviors emerging from partial arousals during slow-wave sleep. Case reports suggest that is more common in men. Precipitating factors include Obstructive Sleep Apnea, insufficient sleep, alcohol and fatigue/stress and history of NREM parasomnias. Report of case(s) A 37-year-old male with bruxism (using mouth guard) and anxiety for 7 years, who presented to the sleep clinic for a second opinion to discuss concerns around the safety of his children due to his sleep related sexual behavior. Sexsomnia was first noted with the stressors related to becoming a parent (fostering children and having biological children). Sexual behavior reported by the couple was mostly provoked with spouse’s touch during sleep. Behaviors ranging from fondling to aggressive sexual intercourse were reported to occur 1 to 3 times/week. There were no injuries during episodes which only occurred in the bedroom with the spouse and the patient was amnestic of his behavior. Due to marital discord provoked by other stressors, he began to sleep alone in the basement. A video-polysomnogram revealed no parasomnia, sleep apnea, or other sleep arousal disorders. Normal REM with atonia was observed. The patient was treated with Duloxetine 20mg for anxiety after the initial sleep visit. His condition contributed to marital separation. In the divorce proceedings, the spouse argued for denial of visitation rights related to his sleep-sexual behaviors noting that the children may be at risk. After separation, his anxiety and stress levels lowered in conjunction with therapy and medication. Follow up after 2 months found the patient asymptomatic. He placed an alarm on his bedroom door, to alert him and others during sleep. There are no published reports to provide a prediction as to whether his condition would-be supporting restrictions in overnight visitation by the foster and biological children. Conclusion In this case, there was a precedent condition (bruxism) and precipitating stress and anxiety, known to provoke NREM parasomnia. The absence of polysomnographic evidence is not unusual. Forensic repercussions, in particular prospective calculations of risk, are poorly described in the literature. Support (if any):",

      "abstract": "Abstract Idiopathic Central Sleep Apnea/Primary Central Sleep Apnea (ICSA) has been an officially recognized sleep disorder since the 2005 International Classification of Sleep Disorders 2nd edition (ICSD-2) and remains in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 3rd edition (ICSD-3). The literature supports the etiology as “high loop gain/increased controller gain,” along with central sleep apnea (CSA) associated with common diagnoses (e.g. heart failure). Available data place the adult population prevalence at about 0.05% (men) and 0.003% (women), while up to 11% of patients diagnosed with CSA may be classified as ICSA. Symptoms may include nocturnal choking, witnessed apneas, awakenings with the sensation of shortness of breath, restless sleep, insomnia, non-restorative sleep, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and variable degrees of snoring. Per the ICSD-3, ICSA may only be diagnosed if “The disorder [CSA] is not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurologic disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder.” However, a putative diagnosis of ICSA should prompt a comprehensive search for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction without heart failure, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery disease, ischemic central nervous system pathology, acromegaly, and licit or illicit respiratory depressant drug use, which could be a potential cause of CSA. Systematic studies are needed to determine the cost effectiveness of this approach. However, if present, ICSA is excluded and intervention can be initiated for the underlying diagnosis, which may resolve CSA and, importantly, improve outcomes specific to the causative disease. Treatment options for ICSA include devices such as adaptive servo-ventilation or transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation, medications such as acetazolamide, and sleep position training.",

      "abstract": "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden and unexplained death of an infant under the age of one (i.e., death for which a cause is not found even after a thorough investigation including review of clinical history, examination of death scene and a complete autopsy). Sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) also known as Sudden unexplained infant death is a term used to describe sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant for which external risk factors may be present. SUDI is a blanket term that encompasses SIDS, other unexplained infant deaths, and explained infant suffocations. SIDS and SUDI are not diagnoses. Risk factors for SIDS fall under three groups: intrinsic risk factors (e.g., male sex, prematurity, exposure to cigarette smoke), extrinsic risk factors (e.g., prone or side sleep position, bed sharing, overheating) and exogenous factors (e.g., ethnicity, climate, geographical location). It has been shown that racial and ethnic disparities (such as Indigenous peoples and other racial minorities) and vulnerabilities (such as low socioeconomic status, fewer social supports, those experiencing problems with housing, violence or mental illness) may contribute to increased risk of SIDS.,In Canada, the incidence of SUDI was the highest in 1980 with a rate of 2.07 SUDI per 1,000 live births. The rates of SUDI and SIDS have since decreased, especially since the 1990s. In 2018, there were ten deaths classified as SIDS in Canada. A global decrease in the incidence of SIDS can be attributed to widespread “Back-to-Sleep” campaigns, which were aimed to promote placing babies in a supine position for sleeping., Several similar risk reduction strategies, primarily focused on sleep position, have been implemented globally with the aim of reducing the incidence of SIDS and SUDI., The “Back-to-sleep” campaign was later expanded to the “Safe-to-sleep” campaign in 2012 to involve new and evolved evidence for preventing SIDS. As a result of continued research, guidelines regarding the prevention of SIDS and SUDI have been developed and updated throughout the last three decades.A previous CADTH Summary of Abstracts report, published in 2016, briefly summarized evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of SIDS. The purpose of this report is to summarize and critically appraise evidence-based guidelines that were published within the last five years regarding interventions for the prevention of SIDS or SUDI.",

Primary nocturnal enuresis describes those children who have always been wet. Secondary nocturnal enuresis is defined as a relapse after a child has been completely dry for at least six months. Up to the age of nine years, nocturnal enuresis is twice as common in boys than girls but thereafter there is no sex difference in prevalence. At the age of five, 2% of children wet every night, and 1% are still wetting every night in their late teens. Bedwetting is not primarily caused by an underlying psychological disorder However, psychological problems and life events can exacerbate or precipitate bedwetting in susceptible children who have a genetic basis for their condition. The three systems approach to the management of the condition addresses: poor arousal from sleep, nocturnal polyuria and bladder dysfunction. Bedwetting is occasionally caused by underlying medical conditions; primarily urological, neurological, or metabolic. It can also be associated with obstructive sleep apnoea. However, these causes are uncommon in primary enuresis. A basic history and examination should exclude these conditions. If the bedwetting has started in the past few days or weeks, systemic illness should be considered e.g. UTI, diabetes mellitus. With secondary enuresis, symptoms or signs of medical and psychological conditions or life events may be elicited as possible causes, and may need separate treatment. Alarm treatment should be considered in any child over seven. The alarm takes several weeks to be effective and needs commitment from both child and carers. Desmopressin may be used as first-line treatment if rapid onset and/or short-term improvement is the priority of treatment or an alarm is inappropriate or undesirable.",

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors have been defined as disorders of arousal (1 ) that occur early in the night and have their onset during stage 3 or 4 sleep (2, 3). During a sleepwalking episode, the individual seems confused, detached, and relatively unresponsive. Night terrors are more dramatic; patients manifest terror and panic, and there is extreme autonomic discharge and vocalization. In both disorders, patients are difficult to arouse, and complete amnesia or minimal recall of the episode is frequent. A genetic component underlies these disorders in that patients often have a family history of sleepwalking, night terrors, or both (4). Sleepwalking and night terrors typically begin in childhood or early adolescence and are usually ‘ ‘outgrown’ ‘ by the end of adolescence, suggesting a delay in CNS maturation (5). When sleepwalking or night terrors have a postpubertal onset or continue into adulthood, however, psychopathology is a more significant causative factor (6, 7). These shared characteristics have led us to propose that sleepwalking and night terrors have a common etiology and are part of the same pathophysiologic spectrum (8). In this paper. we report on febrile illness as a precipitating factor for the onset of sleepwalking or night terrors. To our knowledge. this is the first report establishing this relationship. We have evaluated five children or adolescents who began to sleepwalk or to experience night terrors during or immediately after a febrile illness. The following three case reports illustrate our observations of this phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "Parental concerns about their young children9s sleep are among the most frequent behavior problems discussed with pediatricians. In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child9s period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

This article describes the manifestations, diagnosis, and management of non-REM parasomnias in adults and discusses the social implications of these conditions.Non-REM parasomnias represent a hybrid state of wakefulness and sleep, often triggered by events that increase the frequency of arousals or make it more difficult to fully arouse from sleep. Sleep deprivation, certain medications, and untreated obstructive sleep apnea are known to provoke parasomnias, particularly in those who are genetically predisposed. Non-REM parasomnias include disorders of arousal (ie, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals), sleep-related eating disorder, and exploding head syndrome. Clinical overlap exists between sleep-related eating disorder and disorders of arousal, suggesting that sleep-related eating disorder may be a fourth disorder of arousal or a manifestation of sleepwalking. Exploding head syndrome is a unique parasomnia of uncertain etiology.Non-REM parasomnias can range from minor nuisances to severe, life-altering events. While some patients with non-REM parasomnia experience significant consequences during sleep, wakefulness, or both, non-REM parasomnias do not pose a major risk to most patients. For all patients with non-REM parasomnias, safety should be explicitly discussed and addressed. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be prioritized, as increasing total sleep time, avoiding triggering substances, and treating comorbid sleep disorders is often sufficient for the management of non-REM parasomnias. If symptoms persist despite these interventions, treatment with clonazepam or other medications can be considered.",

      "title": "The ICSD-3 and DSM-5 guidelines for diagnosing narcolepsy: clinical relevance and practicality",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disease manifesting as difficulty with maintaining continuous wake and sleep. Clinical presentation varies but requires excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) occurring alone or together with features of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep dissociation (e.g., cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis), and disrupted nighttime sleep. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is associated with reductions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin due to destruction of hypocretin peptide-producing neurons in the hypothalamus in individuals with a specific genetic predisposition. Updated diagnostic criteria include the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Sleep Disorders Third Edition (ICSD-3). DSM-5 criteria require EDS in association with any one of the following: (1) cataplexy; (2) CSF hypocretin deficiency; (3) REM sleep latency ≤15 minutes on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG); or (4) mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) with ≥2 sleep-onset REM-sleep periods (SOREMPs). ICSD-3 relies more upon objective data in addition to EDS, somewhat complicating the diagnostic criteria: 1) cataplexy and either positive MSLT/PSG findings or CSF hypocretin deficiency; (2) MSLT criteria similar to DSM-5 except that a SOREMP on PSG may count as one of the SOREMPs required on MSLT; and (3) distinct division of narcolepsy into type 1, which requires the presence of cataplexy or documented CSF hypocretin deficiency, and type 2, where cataplexy is absent, and CSF hypocretin levels are either normal or undocumented. We discuss limitations of these criteria such as variability in clinical presentation of cataplexy, particularly when cataplexy may be ambiguous, as well as by age; multiple and/or invasive CSF diagnostic test requirements; and lack of normative diagnostic test data (e.g., MSLT) in certain populations. While ICSD-3 criteria reflect narcolepsy pathophysiology, DSM-5 criteria have greater clinical practicality, suggesting that valid and reliable biomarkers to help standardize narcolepsy diagnosis would be welcomed.",

      "title": "Combining Methods of CBT and Progressive Relaxation for Treating Primary Insomnia: A Case Study",
      "abstract": "Primary insomnia is a mental health problem that is often reported due to the combination of either difficulty in falling asleep or maintaining sleep.It is known that people with primary insomnia experience an increased arousal of physiological, cognitive or emotional process, combined with negative conditioning that is associated with sleep.Progressive relaxation is one of the methods known to be effective in minimizing primary insomnia due to the person's need to release their tension.Frequently, the problem that causes primary insomnia derives from anxiety and muscle tension.Further work on the field is needed to show more the effectiveness of progressive relaxation in primary insomnia, especially in Indonesia, due to the lack of papers showing an intervention effect toward mental health problems.This paper presents a single case study of a graduate student who was diagnosed with primary insomnia.Graduate students are more likely to experience sleep deprivation, due to academic pressures and poor sleeping habits.Primary insomnia was diagnosed in this participant because they met the criteria of primary insomnia, such as frequent complaints of inability to fall asleep, and maintaining sleep for at least one month and an impairment in social and occupational functioning.It was shown during counseling that the participant was experiencing distress mainly caused by family problems.The participant felt burdened about the future due to their family's expectations on several subjects such as career, relationships and academic performance.The participant felt the need to fulfill all of the family's requirements.Another intervention, such as the ABC model from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), was needed due to the participant's negative core belief that made them unable to see their own positive traits.The participant also learned a mantra to cancel out unnecessary negative thoughts that caused sleep disturbance.The intervention was conducted for five sessions over a period of three weeks.The participant reported that before she was introduced to progressive relaxation, she had difficulty maintaining her sleep, she woke up five or six times during her sleep, and she was able to sleep only after midnight.After being taught progressive relaxation, the participant reported that her primary insomnia symptoms had decreased.She was able to sleep without any disturbance and fall sleep at 10 p.m.The participant's anxiety toward her family's expectations also decreased markedly.She reported that she was able to focus on what matters in the present, able to distinguish between her own needs and her family's expectations.Mantras were constantly used by the participant even a year after the intervention.She reported that using a mantra was the most efficient way for her to cancel out negative thoughts.This single case study showed that a short-term intervention was capable of providing an effective outcome for an individual with primary insomnia.It was also shown that progressive relaxation was successful in treating primary insomnia.This single case study showed the need to reduce anxiety for people with poor quality of sleep.It is suggested for further study to replicate progressive relaxation for reducing primary insomnia symptoms due to the successful outcome of this single case study.",

In this paper, the author describes the clinical steps in the differential diagnosis of insomnia symptoms for readers who are not specialized in sleep medicine. When patients complain of insomnia symptoms, physicians first need to check their sleep habits and optimize them if they are inappropriate and interfere with good sleep. Medical history and medication use should also be reviewed in the first step because some medical conditions (e.g., articular diseases, skin diseases, cardiopulmonary disorders) and medications (e.g., steroids, interferon, methyldopa, levodopa) can cause insomnia symptoms. Insomnia symptoms can be caused by a variety of sleep disorders other than insomnia disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, and delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given only if the insomnia symptoms cannot be fully explained by another sleep disorder.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders in children have a negative impact on mental and physical development, and a lack of sleep is one of the most important problems in infancy. At the age when naps are commonly accepted, the judgment of whether the amount of sleep is adequate has been based on the total amount of sleep per day. In other words, the idea is that even if the amount of sleep at night is insuﬃcient, it is not considered insuﬃcient if it is compensated for by taking a long nap or sleeping late on weekend mornings. However, these lifestyle habits disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause social jet lag, which is not appropriate for healthy mental and physical development. Therefore, in this review, I present the average required nighCime basic sleep duration (NBSD) of 10 h for Japanese and 11 h for Caucasian children as a judgment standard. (1) If the child sleeps less than 8 h at night, and (2) if the child sleeps less than 9 h at night or 30 to 60 min less than the required NBSD, immediate treatment is recommended.

      "title": "Sleep Physiology, Circadian Rhythms, Waking Performance and the Development of Sleep-Wake Therapeutics",
      "abstract": "Disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle are highly prevalent and diverse. The aetiology of some sleep disorders, such as circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, is understood at the conceptual level of the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep and in part at a mechanistic level. Other disorders such as insomnia are more difficult to relate to sleep regulatory mechanisms or sleep physiology. To further our understanding of sleep-wake disorders and the potential of novel therapeutics, we discuss recent findings on the neurobiology of sleep regulation and circadian rhythmicity and its relation with the subjective experience of sleep and the quality of wakefulness. Sleep continuity and to some extent REM sleep emerge as determinants of subjective sleep quality and waking performance. The effects of insufficient sleep primarily concern subjective and objective sleepiness as well as vigilant attention, whereas performance on higher cognitive functions appears to be better preserved albeit at the cost of increased effort. We discuss age-related, sex and other trait-like differences in sleep physiology and sleep need and compare the effects of existing pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep- and wake-promoting treatments. Successful non-pharmacological approaches such as sleep restriction for insomnia and light and melatonin treatment for circadian rhythm sleep disorders target processes such as sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythmicity. Most pharmacological treatments of sleep disorders target specific signalling pathways with no well-established role in either sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythmicity. Pharmacological sleep therapeutics induce changes in sleep structure and the sleep EEG which are specific to the mechanism of action of the drug. Sleep- and wake-promoting therapeutics often induce residual effects on waking performance and sleep, respectively. The need for novel therapeutic approaches continues not at least because of the societal demand to sleep and be awake out of synchrony with the natural light-dark cycle, the high prevalence of sleep-wake disturbances in mental health disorders and in neurodegeneration. Novel approaches, which will provide a more comprehensive description of sleep and allow for large-scale sleep and circadian physiology studies in the home environment, hold promise for continued improvement of therapeutics for disturbances of sleep, circadian rhythms and waking performance.",

      "title": "1171 Hypersomnia Secondary to Long Covid",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Recognition of Long Covid is increasing. In a recent meta-analysis in youth with Long Covid, the most prevalent clinical symptoms were mood (16.50%), fatigue (9.66%), and sleep disorders (8.42%). However, there is a paucity of data in the management of these symptoms. Report of case(s) We present a case of severe hypersomnolence after a mild Covid-19 infection in a 13 year-old female with no significant history, an acceptable age-appropriate sleep-wake schedule without nighttime awakenings or sleepiness prior to infection. Post-infection, she developed a one year history of sleep onset and maintenance insomnia, significant circadian delays, sleep inertia, brain fog and headaches. She was referred to sleep medicine and responded to treatment for a circadian rhythm disorder with sleep-wake restructuring, melatonin, and strict sleep hygiene. Sleep fragmentation, unrefreshing sleep, and hypersomnolence persisted; ESS=15/24. Sleep duration was often ≥12 hours in a 24 hour period. The patient could not wake easily, and often missed school or left early for sleepiness and headaches. A trial of gabapentin 200mg at bedtime failed. Sleep diagnostics were performed. Polysomnography showed no sleep disruptors, 8 hours of sleep, and some delayed slow wave sleep periods. Mean sleep latency testing (MSLT) showed MSL of 15.4min; 1 SOREM (nap #1). With a working diagnosis of hypersomnia due to medical condition vs. idiopathic hypersomnia, methylphenidate up to 36mg ER was trialed with some improvement. A recent adult case with Long Covid and ADHD-like syndrome also responded to stimulant use, though no guidelines are established for Long Covid. Oxybate was later added up to 2g once nightly which helped resolve sleep inertia, improve sleep quality and reduce sleepiness(ESS=4/24). She was able to return to school full time and reached normal functioning. Conclusion While the pathophysiology of Long Covid is still under investigation, symptom management of sleepiness can impact functioning. This case demonstrates a successful treatment of a patient with Long Covid and hypersomnolence with resolution of excessive sleepiness, morning inertia, and sleep fragmentation with a treatment approach similar to that of idiopathic hypersomnia, using an oxybate along with daytime stimulant use.

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "abstract": "Subjective sleepiness is defined as \"an elemental feeling state\" by which the subject, and only him/her knows whether he/she is alert or sleepy. Subjective sleepiness has little been used for the clinical evaluation of sleepiness. Objective sleepiness is defined as a consequence of the homeostatic need for sleep. In the absence of a measurable marker of the fulfillment of the function of sleep, the evaluation of objective sleepiness has to rely on a behavioral approach based on the postulate that the more you need sleep (i.e., the sleepier you are), the more likely you are to fall asleep. However, as for many other fundamental human behaviors (drinking, eating, sexual behavior), it is likely that the sleeping behavior serves other purposes than its primary objective, which distorts the relationship between the observed sleeping behavior and the actual need for sleep. The likelihood to fall asleep can be measured by the speed with which a sleep episode occurs under standardized laboratory conditions (multiple sleep latency test, maintenance of wakefulness test, OSLER test), or by the frequency of unwanted sleep episodes under the more naturalistic conditions of daily life (Epworth Sleepiness Scale). These various approaches have advantages and drawbacks, but none of them can be considered the \"gold standard\".",

In addition to existing investigations on vegetative functional disturbances, the role of noise as a risk factor has to be determined and its effects have to be quantified. The significance of noise‐induced sleep disturbances in relation to health and well‐being, is also controversial. The hypothesized causal connection between acoustical stimulation and the occurrence of disorders, includes primary‐effects (e.g. awakenings) and after‐effects (e.g. changes in mood or performance). To date, it has not been feasible to determine late after‐effects, such as health disorders. The most often reported sociopsychological effect of noise is general annoyance, whereby annoyance is defined as disturbance of communication, rest, recreation or concentration.

      "title": "Parasomnias",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are defined as unpleasant or undesirable behavioral or experiential phenomena that occur predominately or exclusively during the sleep period. Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

      "title": "What is sleep?",
      "abstract": "Abstract There are two distinct types of sleep—non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—a balance of which is needed to function well during the day. During the night, these two types of sleep alternate with each other. Probably everyone dreams but the purpose of dreaming is generally unclear. The pattern of wakefulness and sleep is controlled by an internal clock in the brain (the body clock). Your level of alertness varies within each 24 hours. The tendency to sleep is greatest in the early hours of the morning (corresponding to deep NREM sleep) and (although less so) in the early afternoon. People vary in the time of day when they are most alert: ‘larks’ in the morning and ‘owls’ in the evening. Most people show neither of these patterns. Daytime naps can make it difficult to get to sleep at bedtime if they are too long or too late in the day. Long naps can make you feel groggy afterwards. Sleep has some features in common with other states of relative inactivity, such as coma or, in some species, hibernation. All of these states usually occur while lying down with little movement and reduced awareness of the environment to varying degrees. However, sleep is very different from the rest.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of parasomnias occurring in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.Disorders of arousal are characterized by dissociated sleep, with wake and sleep phenomena intermingling, and local sleep, in which different areas of the brain exist simultaneously in different states of wakefulness or sleep. The frequency of arousals from slow-wave sleep with delta or mixed-frequency activity has a high sensitivity but relatively low specificity for the diagnosis of arousal parasomnias.Disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals) are characterized by incomplete awakenings from slow-wave sleep, limited recall of imagery, and partial or complete amnesia. They occur most frequently in childhood. Management includes correction of precipitating factors, attention to safety, behavioral techniques, and medications. Sleep-related eating disorder is a variant of arousal disorders and may be associated with the use of short-acting hypnotics and restless legs syndrome. Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations can occur with visual loss, dementia with Lewy bodies, use of β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and anxiety. Exploding head syndrome occurs at wake-sleep transition or on waking during the night, is usually benign, and requires treatment only if significant sleep disruption occurs.",

      "title": "Nasal dilator for management of sleep apnea",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Sleep disorders are commonly caused by nasal obstruction. Fatigue, when present in those with nasal problems and otherwise unexplained, is often considered secondary to poor or inadequate sleep.‘,’ Nasal obstruction itself is associated with many systemic reflexes, including changes in intrathoracic pressure, pulse, and blood pressure.3 Reports during the 19th century proposed a nasal reflex rather than sleep disturbance as the origin of fatigue in many patients with nasal obstruction. The following case describes fatigue associated with nasal obstruction promptly relieved by a nasal dilator and therefore unrelated to sleep abnormalities. The patient was a 4%year-old man with a lo-year history of unexplained persistent fatigue unrelieved by rest. The fatigue was especially pronounced on awakening but continued throughout the day. It was not associated with pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, headache, or known sleep disturbance. Aside from fatigue, symptoms were limited to nasal congestion especially on the left side and a “heavy-headedness” sensation in the head. Four comprehensive examinations over the 10 symptomatic years were without relevant findings. Symptoms of nasal congestion and a cyst in the left maxillary sinus noted on a sinus roentgenogram prompted the following procedures: creation of antral windows, removal of the maxillary cyst, nasal septum reconstruction, and partial resection of the inferior turbinates; all with no effect on the fatigue. Approximately 8 years after the onset of fatigue, the patient noted that relief could be obtained by pressing up the left external nares. This observation suggested dysfunction of the nasal valve and prompted reconstruction using cartilage grafts, a procedure that was unsuccessful in relieving his inadequate air flow or his fatigue. At the suggestion of a consultant he purchased a nasal dilator for the left anterior nares and obtained almost immediate relief of the fatigue. Fatigue consistently returned within 15 minutes if the dilator was removed and promptly resolved when reinserted, indicating the lack of any association with sleep. Systemic reactions to nasal disease are well documented in the medical literature but fatigue, when associated with nasal obstruction, is generally considered secondary to sleep abnormalities. Before the clear association of nasal obstruction and sleep abnormalities was known, reports in the older literature postulated a “nasal reflex” to explain the resolution of fatigue and a number of other significant complaints after nasal surgery or cauterization. In 1898, Wells reported cases of neurological and mental manifestations of nasal disease associated with extraordinary fatigue.* At the time of the linkage of nasal symptoms with fatigue and inability to concentrate was well accepted enough to generate the term “aprosexia nasalis.” More recent research documents profound changes in blood pressure, pulse, and respiration with nasal obstruction. Furthermore, nasal stimulation is associated with vasoconstruction, laryngeal construction, and bronchoconstriction. Cottle maintained that air currents stimulating the nasal mucosa effect remote organs by nerve pathways and may be responsible for a state of ill health. Nasal valve movements, he also noted, were largely responsible for the “rest” obtained by the body during sleeps5 This case report suggests that unilateral nasal obstruction may be responsible for fatigue independent of any effect it might have on sleep.",

      "title": "Sleep problems in children with dyslexia: understanding the role of sleep in neurocognitive development through the lens of developmental disorders",
      "abstract": "It has long been recognised that sleep is more than a passive recovery state or mere inconvenience. Sleep plays an active role in maintaining a healthy body, brain and mind, and numerous studies suggest that sleep is integral to learning and memory. The importance of sleep for cognition is clear in studies of those experiencing sleep deprivation, who show consistent deficits across cognitive domains in relation to nonsleep-deprived controls, particularly in tasks that tax attention or executive functions 1. Poor sleep has been associated with poor grades, and academic performance suffers when sleep is sacrificed for extra study 2. Thus, it is perhaps unsurprising that children with developmental disorders of learning and cognition often suffer from sleep disturbances. These have been well documented in children with autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), where sleep problems can be particularly severe. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that sleep can be atypical across a spectrum of learning disorders. Understanding the ways in which sleep is affected in different developmental disorders can not only support the design and implementation of effective assessment and remediation programs, but can also inform theories of how sleep supports cognition in typical development. The study by Carotenuto et al. 3 in this issue makes a valuable contribution to this literature by looking at sleep disturbances in children with developmental dyslexia. Dyslexia is the most common specific learning disorder, affecting around one in 10 children in our classrooms. It is characterised by difficulties with reading and spelling and is primarily caused by a deficit in phonological processing. However, dyslexia often co-occurs with other developmental disorders, such as ADHD and specific language impairment, and there can be striking heterogeneity between children. This has led to the suggestion that dyslexia can result from complex combinations of multiple risk factors and impairments 4. Consequently, research attention is turning towards the wider constellation of subclinical difficulties often experienced by children with dyslexia, including potential sleep problems. Two preliminary studies have found differences in the sleep architecture of children with dyslexia in comparison with typical peers, using overnight sleep EEG recordings (polysomnography) 5, 6. Notably, children with dyslexia showed unusually long periods of slow wave sleep and an increased number of sleep spindles. Slow wave sleep and spindles are related to language learning, most notably through promoting the consolidation of new vocabulary 7. Children with dyslexia have pronounced deficits in learning new oral vocabulary, providing a plausible theoretical link between sleep disturbances and language difficulties. If sleep problems do in fact exacerbate the learning difficulties associated with dyslexia, as well as impacting on daily cognitive function, this could have important implications for intervention and support programs. However, an important first step is to establish the nature and extent of sleep disturbances in dyslexia. Previous studies 5, 6 have used small samples (N = <30) and examined a large array of sleep parameters on a small number of unusual nights (where children were wearing sleep recording equipment), as opposed to looking at global patterns over time. As such, how representative these findings are is questionable, and consequently these studies should be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing. Carotenuto et al. 3 address some of these concerns, administering questionnaire measures of sleep habits to the parents of 147 children with dyslexia and 766 children without dyslexia, aged 8–12 years. A sample of this size allows for a robust analysis of sleep characteristics. Therefore, their findings that children with dyslexia showed higher rates of several markers of sleep disorders lend significant weight to suggestions that dyslexia might be associated with an increased risk for sleep problems. Importantly, the sleep questionnaire used by Carotenuto et al. 3 allows for a breakdown of sleep disturbances. It is interesting to note that they found the greatest difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep, sleep breathing disorders and disorders of arousal. This closely mirrors the types of sleep problem documented in children with ADHD 8. While Carotenuto et al. 3 took care to exclude children with comorbid diagnoses, many children with dyslexia show subtle features of attention disorders that do not reach clinical thresholds. Future studies that can establish whether sleep disturbances are associated with subclinical attention problems or dyslexia per se will be particularly informative for understanding which cognitive skills most critically relate to sleep. This is also vital information for establishing whether information about sleep habits could have clinical relevance in the assessment and management of children with dyslexia. There are a number of ways in which Carotenuto et al.'s findings could be taken forward in future studies. Not least, the findings need to be replicated using more objective measures of sleep, including polysomnography and/or actigraphy, both of which can be administered in the home environment. It is notable that neither of the two polysomnography studies to date observed differences in sleep onset time or night-time awakenings in children with dyslexia compared with typical peers. Although this could be a result of a lack of statistical power due to the very small samples in these studies, the discrepancy could also be due to the subjective nature of the questionnaires used. Future studies must also take care to recruit samples that are free of referral bias. Carotenuto et al. recruited their sample via referrals to a hospital clinic; hence, it is possible that such children may be more likely to present with multiple issues (including sleep problems), rather than reading difficulty alone. Thus, it will be important to examine the prevalence of sleep difficulties in referred and nonreferred samples. Although Carotenuto et al. make substantial progress in establishing the frequency of sleep disorders in dyslexia, the study design cannot test causal hypotheses or establish whether there was a link between sleep difficulties and severity of reading impairment. Indeed, a great challenge in the field of sleep and developmental disorders is establishing the extent to which sleep is causally related to cognitive difficulties. It is possible that brain abnormalities associated with disorders can cause both cognitive and sleep differences without them being directly linked to each other. Moreover, sleep difficulties may simply be a consequence of increased anxiety associated with having a developmental disorder. Randomised controlled trials are often viewed as the gold standard means of establishing causality. For example, a recent study has shown that a sleep intervention for children with ADHD led to significant improvements in ADHD symptomatology and working memory 9. Given that the type of sleep problems encountered by children with dyslexia are similar to those in ADHD, it is tempting to propose that such an intervention may prove useful for children with dyslexia. However, it is important to be cautious: only 42% of the children with dyslexia in the Carotenuto et al. study suffered sleep difficulties. This indicates that while having dyslexia seems to greatly increase a child's risk of sleep problems, sleep disturbances are unlikely to represent a causal pathway to reading difficulties. Therefore, it is unlikely that a sleep intervention would be useful for all individuals with dyslexia. Nonetheless, it remains plausible that sleep difficulties could exacerbate cognitive and literacy difficulties in some children, who might then benefit from clinical intervention. If this is the case, then such interventions should be seen as complementary to literacy-targeted interventions that tackle the reading difficulty itself. Further research is needed to ascertain whether and how sleep difficulties contribute to the difficulties experienced by children with dyslexia, and to establish which children with dyslexia are at the greatest risk of sleep disturbances. Understanding the role of sleep in developmental disorders is vital, not only to improve assessment and treatment for affected children and families, but also to advance theoretical models of sleep and neurocognitive development. While sleep problems are common in several neurodevelopmental disorders, these problems are likely to differ qualitatively and quantitatively across children with different difficulties. Therefore, it is important to study sleep problems within each learning disorder as well as to look at the heterogeneity across the spectrum of learning difficulties. Studies such as the one by Carotenuto et al., which looks specifically at sleep in dyslexia, are crucial in this regard, raising awareness of the possible role of sleep difficulties and opening up a plethora of potential lines of future research in this area.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder is a form of anxiety disorder which is poorly known in children and manifests as a series of symptoms occurring after an extraordinary event outside the range of usual human experiences and responsible for a feeling of terror. Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family.

Other definitions exist, and there is no clear consensus in this matter. The core elements of insomnia are an inadequate quantity or quality of sleep, with both nocturnal and daytime consequences. Traditionally, insomnia has been subgrouped into sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintaining insomnia, and insomnia with early morning awakening; however, there is extensive overlap, and most insomniacs fit into more than one subgroup. Sleep disorders, particularly in the elderly, are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality, significant limitations in activities of daily living, and impaired quality of life. Aside from the obvious complications of daytime fatigue and somnolence, insomniacs have an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, increased use of over-the-counter medications and alcohol, and a higher incidence of accidents and unemployment. Chronic sleep loss has multisystem consequences and may represent a risk factor for obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. However, the brunt of negative effects of sleep deprivation is borne by the brain. Chronic insomnia independently predicts incident cognitive decline in older men, but it also has been suggested that some degree of apparent age-related cognitive decline may be due to treatable insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric sleep disorders are quite common and often disturbing to either the patient or the child's family. As the patient matures into adult, sleep disorders continue to be common and an important factor in development, both social and cognitive. Sleep disorders can adversely impact physical and mental health. Nonrestorative sleep can hamper a child's ability to concentrate and control emotions and behavior. Sleep disorders vary among age groups, but most can occur with varying frequency at any age. Several disorders are typically seen only during the first few years of life, including colic, excessive nighttime feedings, and sleep onset association disorder. A number of conditions are common during childhood but begin to improve as the child ages. The non-REM sleep parasomnias, including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors, are the most common in the pediatric category. Nightmares are also common in childhood but can occur at any age. Sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respirations are not found only in adults but are, in fact, quite common in the pediatric population. While these disorders can occur at any age, treatment options vary substantially by age.",

The obvious, prolonged, dramatic events are most likelyto raise concerns of patients, relatives, and clinicians, prompting medical eval-uation (1). As delineated by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders,Second Edition, parasomnias are classified as (i) disorders of arousal [from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep], (ii) parasomnias usually associated withrapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and (iii) other parasomnias (1).",

      "abstract": "Sleep difficulties are often leading symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that untreated insomnia predicts the onset of mental health disorders. Other sleep disorders also often cause mood and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, overlapping symptoms of sleep apnea, a sleep disorder with undoubted public health significance, and depression merits special attention. Sleep disorders have profound effect on daytime functioning causing daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. These symptoms may severely affect both the quality of life of the patient and also the sleep and quality of life of their bedpartners and family members, as well. It is increasingly appreciated that the majority of medically ill patients suffer from sleep disorders and sleep complaints, which contribute to their impaired quality of life and clinical outcomes. “Sleep Health” is an important aspect of everyone's life but has a special relevance in mentally or medically ill patients. In our studies focusing on patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (moderate to severe chronic renal failure, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) we have found high prevalence of sleep disorders (insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep, Sleep apnea). We have shown that they are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, increased illness intrusiveness and worse quality of life. Furthermore, RLS predicted mortality of kidney transplant recipients. In my presentation I will cover the most important aspects of the complex relationship between sleep disorders, mental and physical health and quality of life.",

      "title": "Early identification and intervention for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

      "abstract": "The development of respiratory failure is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders that involve the respiratory muscles. However, the high incidence of sleep-related breathing problems in this population is less well known. In patients with neuromuscular disease, nocturnal breathing abnormalities frequently precede respiratory failure during wakefulness by months or even years. These nocturnal breathing problems are caused by multiple factors, including diaphragm and upper airway muscle weakness, scoliosis, obesity, and central respiratory control problems. Advances in the understanding of the links between sleep-disordered breathing and the development of daytime dysfunction and respiratory failure has revolutionized the management of these individuals. Mask positive pressure therapy is now available to improve both quality of life and longevity for these individuals. The lack of correlation between daytime testing and the severity of nocturnal breathing abnormalities makes it difficult to predict the presence of sleep-disordered breathing. Further, patients may not always be aware of symptoms associated with sleep-disordered breathing, even if specifically questioned. However, simple bedside measurements of vital capacity and inspiratory muscle strength can provide useful guides for when nocturnal respiratory monitoring is indicated.",

      "title": "The impact of stress on sleep: Pathogenic sleep reactivity as a vulnerability to insomnia and circadian disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep reactivity is the trait-like degree to which stress exposure disrupts sleep, resulting in difficulty falling and staying asleep. Individuals with highly reactive sleep systems experience drastic deterioration of sleep when stressed, whereas those with low sleep reactivity proceed largely unperturbed during stress. Research shows that genetics, familial history of insomnia, female gender and environmental stress influence how the sleep system responds to stress. Further work has identified neurobiological underpinnings for sleep reactivity involving disrupted cortical networks and dysregulation in the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Sleep reactivity is most pathologically and clinically pertinent when in excess, such that high sleep reactivity predicts risk for future insomnia disorder, with early evidence suggesting high sleep reactivity corresponds to severe insomnia phenotypes (sleep onset insomnia and short sleep insomnia). High sleep reactivity is also linked to risk of shift-work disorder, depression and anxiety. Importantly, stress-related worry and rumination may exploit sensitive sleep systems, thereby augmenting the pathogenicity of sleep reactivity. With the development of cost-effective assessment of sleep reactivity, we can now identify individuals at risk of future insomnia, shift-work disorder and mental illness, thus identifying a target population for preventive intervention. Given that insomniacs with high sleep reactivity tend to present with severe insomnia phenotypes, patient sleep reactivity may inform triaging to different levels of treatment. Future research on sleep reactivity is needed to clarify its neurobiology, characterize its long-term prospective associations with insomnia and shift-work disorder phenotypes, and establish its prognostic value for mental illness and other non-sleep disorders.",

The disorders also contribute to significant cognitive, emotional, and physical health challenges. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the US population. It is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and early-morning waking and is linked to daytime distress and impairment. Common sleep disruptors include environmental factors such as noise, light, and air pollution and also personal habits such as excessive screen use before bedtime. Evaluating patients with insomnia in primary care requires integrating sleep health assessments into routine visits and use of insomnia screening tools and sleep diaries for accurate diagnosis. Nonpharmacologic therapies such as sleep hygiene and cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia are the preferred treatments. Pharmacotherapy or combination therapy (with cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia and pharmacotherapy) may be considered when these interventions are ineffective. Family physicians should weigh the risks and benefits of insomnia medication use carefully for all patients but especially for older adults because of potential adverse effects. Managing insomnia effectively in primary care involves a comprehensive approach, prioritizing nonpharmacologic strategies, regular monitoring, and patient-centered care.",

      "abstract": "The fundamental purpose of sleep remains one of the most compelling questions yet to be answered in the area of neuroscience, if not all of biology. A pervasive behavior among members of the animal kingdom, the functional necessity of engaging regularly in sleep is best demonstrated by showing that failing to do so leads to a broad repertoire of pathological outcomes including cognitive, immunological, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes, among others. Indeed, an absolute requirement for sleep has been shown in studies that have demonstrated that continuous total deprivation of sleep for as short a period as 15 days is generally lethal in some species. The most common clinical sleep disorder, insomnia, is both a principal disease (primary insomnia) as well as a co-morbidity of a large number of other ostensibly unrelated diseases including chronic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. From a treatment perspective, restoring normal healthy sleep delivers subsequent benefits in waking cognitive function and mood with the potential for beneficial therapeutic impact on daily functioning across multiple diseases for which restorative healthy sleep is compromised. Our remarkable escalation in understanding the anatomy and physiology of sleep/wake control mechanisms provides new opportunities to modify the neurobiology of sleep and wake-related behaviors in novel and exciting ways. In parallel, expansion of sleep research into novel interfaces between sleep-wake biology and disease states is revealing additional extensive implications of lost sleep. Current investigational and conventional pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep and wake disorders are discussed based on their mechanism of action within the CNS and their effect on sleep and wake. This review of recent sleep biology and sleep pharmacology peers into the future of sleep therapeutics to highlight both mechanistic safety and functional outcomes as key for differentiating and establishing success for the next generation of arousal modifying therapeutics.

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent and multifaceted and have serious consequences. They play an important role within psychiatric symptoms and disorders. On the one hand they may appear as a symptom of a disorder, which may also be a diagnostic criterion, as for example in affective disorders, on the other hand they may be independent disorders or last but not least sequelae of psychiatric disorders or their pharmacological therapy, as with antidepressants or neuroleptics, which may cause or deteriorate nocturnal movement disorders. They may aggravate psychiatric disorders, perpetuate them or predict a disease onset, like in depressive or manic episodes. Also in organic sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders or nocturnal movement disorders, increased anxiety or depression scores may be observed. Patients suffering from sleep disorders do not only experience impaired well-being, but also show deteriorations in cognition and performance, have a higher risk of accidents, are generally more prone to health problems, have a higher sickness absence rate, seek medical help more often and thus are also an important socioeconomic factor. This is why sleep disorders should be taken seriously and treated adequately.",

      "abstract": "Chrono-fatigue is often present in patients engaged in shift or night work, as well as in passengers travelling across many time zones (jet lag syndrome). Some disturbances of the circadian system are responsible for clinical syndromes characterized by chrono-fatigue, one of them being the sleep delayed phase insomnia. Circadian sleep disorders, either functional or structural, are characterized not only by disturbances in sleep architecture and/or sleep quality, but also by the inability to fall asleep and stay awake at desired times. Similarly, sleep and fatigue present in those circadian disorders typically exhibit a daily cyclic pattern. Night workers and shift workers do have chronic sleep deprivation and desynchronisation of their circadian system with the entraining environment. Those phenomena are responsible for severe vigilance problems, a decrease in work productivity and deleterious health side effects. Fatigue and sleep problems in circadian disorders can now benefit from treatments based on the programed use of synchronizers of the circadian clock, like chronotherapy, bright light and melatonin, combined with adequate sleep hygiene recommendations.",

      "title": "Rapid eye movement and non-REM sleep parasomnias",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias comprise the behavioral, experiential, and autonomic nervous system disorders surrounding rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep and can cause injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Parasomnias often involve the abnormal release of instinctual drives, such as locomotion, aggression, feeding, and sex during sleep, and can manifest with dream-enacting behaviors. Parasomnias are relevant to psychiatrists in regards to their misdiagnosis as a psychiatric disorder; their nocturnal extension of a daytime psychiatric disorder; their stress-responsivity; their induction or aggravation by psychotropic drugs; their adverse psychologic con- sequences; their link to various neurologic and medical disorders; and their forensic implications. Parasomnias can be categorized as primary disorders of sleep, or as secondary organ system disorders emerging during the sleep period. The evaluation of parasomnias includes clinical interviews, review of medical records, screening psy- chologic tests, neurologic examination, and hospital-based polysomnographic moni- toring. This article discusses the six most prominent behavioral parasomnias: REM sleep behavior disorder, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals (including abnormal sleep related sexual behaviors and severe morning sleep inertia), sleep relat- ed eating disorder, and sleep related dissociative disorders. Parasomnias can appear at any time in the human life cycle, often demonstrate prominent gender discordances, and can usually be accurately diagnosed and effectively treated.",

      "title": "THE CHILD WHO HAS SEVERE NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT",
      "abstract": "The formulation of a diagnosis in a child who has neurologic impairment should not (except in extreme circumstances) be made on the basis of a single finding. For example, the presence of delayed milestones, primitive or exaggerated reflexes, abnormal muscle tone, abnormal posture, abnormal neurologic examination, and temporal course should all be used to make the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Furthermore, because each condition has a spectrum of disabilities from mild to severe involvement, determination of the child's abilities and impairments should be part of the diagnostic process. Because the child lives in a number of different environments, assessment of the child's functional abilities and evaluation of the environments should be made. Finally, evaluations by specialists in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychology, special education, and nutrition may be necessary to complete the child's diagnosis. The ability to examine the child over a period of time (i.e., continuity of care) allows the practitioner to provide a more accurate prognosis for future development. It also enables easier diagnosis of the child when he or she is acutely ill. This also allows a more trusting relationship to develop with the parent and enhances the ability to influence the psychosocial conditions that affect outcomes. Finally, all these children should have care coordination (case management) (i.e., someone who can ensure that they receive the care they need, without duplication) across all settings, including home, school, hospitals, and ambulatory facilities.",

Factors influencing the increased risk of hearing loss relate, for example, to abortion, older age, too frequent exposure to noise. Hearing loss usually occurs gradually. Symptoms that may indicate hearing loss are buzzing or tinnitus, dizziness, balance problems, ear pain, or a feeling of a foreign object. It is important to check the hearing in newborns in order to react in time to possible irregularities. Symptoms of deafness in a child occur in the form of non-response to sounds and lack of interest in musical toys. Children between the ages of 8 and 12 months will not respond to their name in case of hearing loss, and the absence of speech is possible",

Whether these decrements are caused by short sleep duration or extended wakefulness is unknown. In this study, healthy volunteers were randomized into either a chronically sleep-restricted or control protocol while living on a 20-h “day,” thus enabling short sleep without extended wakefulness. We demonstrate that chronic insufficient sleep, even without extended wakefulness, leads to neurobehavioral performance decrements at all times of the day, even when the circadian system is promoting arousal. These findings have implications for the understanding of basic physiology, the substantial population who chronically obtains insufficient sleep, and all of us who depend on sleep-restricted individuals working in safety-sensitive occupations.",

      "abstract": "Approximately one third of our lives are spent in sleeping.Although largely an enigma, sleep is an important component of human behavior and provides an emotional and physical restoration to the body.Abnormalities in the normal physiology of sleep often cause a sleep complaint (e.g., difficulty falling asleep) or result in a sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea, narcolepsy).The prevalence of sleep difficulties in the general population is estimated to be 30% to 35%.Sleep is complex psycho-physiologic phenomenon that can be documented in sleep laboratory studies.During sleep the brain is extremely active and produces a characteristic pattern of stages, that cycle during the night.There is a wide inter-individual variability in the amount of sleep required per night (i.e., 3 to 10 hours.)A circadian rhythm of sleep and walking is established shortly after birth and changes over the life cycle.A deceleration of the 24 cycle occurs during adolescence and is typified by difficulty falling asleep.The rhythm returns to 24 hours during adulthood and accelerates with increasing age.Thus elderly individuals commonly complain of falling asleep early in the evening and waking early in the morning.Two oscillators with different period lengths control the suprachiasmic nucleus and the other occurs through neurobiologic mechanism.Two peptides, δ-sleep inducing peptide and factor S appear to be involved in the biochemical regulation.Synchronization of the oscillators with the 24-hour cycle imposed by the earth's rotation requires a routinely occurring zeitgeber (e.g., clock, light, shower, breakfast) to set the internal clock.Practically, young person should awaken at the same time daily to shorten the oscillators, and elderly persons should delay the onset of sleep until a set time to stretch the oscillators.The neurotransmitter norepinephrine is involved in wakefulness and dreaming, while serotonin is active during non-dreaming sleep.The interaction between the cholinergic system and the noradrenergic system also may play a role in sleep.The pharmacological treatment of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are updated through this review article.",

Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances.

      "title": "Sleep: universal for all, problematic for some",
      "abstract": "Human sleep is a paradox that evades detailed understanding to a large extent. Despite the fact people sleep almost every night, and despite advances in the scientific understanding of sleep, most of us have no insight or even a basic understanding of what happens when we sleep. Poor sleep, or a perception of poor sleep, vexes many. Insomnia or sleep disturbance is a very common presentation in primary care, and the effect of insomnia may be trivialised, to some degree, in the primary care setting, contributing to a lack of support and a dearth of clear management guidelines.1 An understanding of sleep and sleep requirements across the human life cycle remains elusive. As the parents of a newborn child can often attest, babies usually need to sleep a lot, but it is relatively uncommon for the infant's sleep cycle to align with that of the parents. Conversely, older people often perceive that their sleep is poor, and up to 50% of older people complain about difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep.2 Although normal aging processes can account for some of that insomnia, medical or psychiatric diseases, including chronic pain, dementia, depression, sleep-disordered breathing and more, can also have a profound impact. In this edition of the Journal we see discussion of this important clinical issue in detail. The reality is that there are a good many drugs in the pharmacopoeia that have sedating properties, and generally these agents, when given at an adequate dose, will cause an older person to fall asleep. It is another question altogether as to whether that person will remain asleep for the desired duration of rest, whether the sleep achieved will be of good quality and will fulfil the physiological purposes required, or whether the medications will continue to work if administered on a longer-term basis. Moreover, by the time a healthcare professional of any discipline has completed their basic training and enters the workforce, it is virtually impossible not to have been comprehensively appraised of the potential adverse consequences of the use of hypnosedatives in the context of advanced age. Equally, it is well-nigh inconceivable not to have been thoroughly exposed to the worthy concept of dealing with sleep disturbance (particularly among older people) by addressing underlying causes. On this basis, it is really not plausible to argue that ignorance of some of the issues involved on the part of doctors, pharmacists and nurses is driving the persistent use of these medicines among older people. Epidemiologists, academics and even social commentators with no qualifications at all are building reputations and social media profiles from being the dispensers of wisdom about the inadvisability of resorting to drugs to address insomnia among the elderly, and who could blame them? Prima facie, it would appear almost impossible to advocate otherwise. Of course, were the matter to be as simple as is presented by some, there would be no older people with insomnia: all the underlying causes would be adroitly addressed, and our older generations would have sound and satisfying sleep of adequate duration every night; but this is very clearly not the case. The reality is that many of the underlying causes of sleep disturbance for older people are refractory to intervention, severe, progressive and, in some cases, irreversible. In one's seventh, eighth and ninth decades of life, sleep may not come as easily as it does to one in the flush of youth, but if the underlying causes cannot be remediated, should this be the basis to suggest that these older people should be consigned to endure sleep disturbance for the rest of their relatively brief time on the planet? The possible downside of pharmacotherapy for sleep disturbances affecting older people is a concept not lost upon any discerning clinician. There has recently been a huge raft of attention focusing upon the prescribing rates of sedating medications in settings like aged and extended care facilities. For example, the RedUSe study, well-designed and conducted with rigour, conclusively demonstrated that the proportion of residents in aged care facilities prescribed antipsychotics and benzodiazepines can be reduced by the implementation of a multifaceted intervention.3 The nuances can be debated ad infinitum, but the fact remains that although the intervention reduced the prescribing of a potentially hazardous group of drugs, the long-term outcomes (both clinical and economic) associated with doing so were not assessed. Proponents will point to the prevention of possible harm associated with a higher rate of usage were the intervention not implemented, but of course, in the absence of measurement of long-term clinical outcomes, we cannot be sure. In the meantime, other parameters that escaped measurement included those related to quality of life, injuries that may arise because of agitated behaviour and consumer preference. There can be no denying that hypnosedatives and other psychotropic drugs have the potential to cause harm for older people but, like the case for other clinical situations, both sides of the equation warrant consideration. There are dozens of examples of widely used drugs with serious adverse effects that are more common among the elderly, but it is of interest that hypnosedatives have been singled out for special attention. Like the starting position established for the construct of the RedUSe study, the respected Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults4 make it very clear that the learned consensus panel assembled to determine the ratings considers that benzodiazepines and antipsychotics should be avoided for older people if possible. By contrast, the guidance provided in relation to anticoagulants is less strongly worded than for benzodiazepines – an interesting observation, given that on the basis of per capita usage rates, it could be argued that the former drugs create more iatrogenic harm for the elderly than the latter. To be clear, this point is not made here to argue that hypnosedatives or anticoagulants should be either used or avoided for older people: that is a matter for much wiser people than this commentator. However, it is reasonable to point out that there appears to be a kind of societal overlay applied in the consideration of medicines used for sleep. It is interesting to consider that the people who publish guidance and provide commentary about what is and is not appropriate in terms of the medicines prescribed to assist older people with sleep are almost always younger people, yet to experience the decline in sleep quality and duration that often accompanies older age, but as Joni Mitchell once sang, ‘you don't know what you've got 'till it's gone’. As is the case for all medicines, it is important that the use of hypnosedatives for older people is guided with a conservative hand intent on averting avoidable harm; but, at the same time, it is also important not to dismiss the importance of a good night's rest. An Irish proverb suggests that ‘a good laugh and a long sleep are the best cures in the doctor's book’. Perhaps that prescription may be written more often? The author declares that he has no conflicts of interest.",

Approximately 50% of older adults complain of sleep disturbance. Older adults often take longer to fall asleep, have lower sleep efficiencies, and have more nighttime awakenings. They are also sleepier during the day than younger adults. Compared to elderly men, women are better able to maintain satisfactory sleep with aging. Aging is associated with changes in sleep architecture (Box 14–1). Greater nighttime sleep disturbance may lead to daytime sleepiness and more frequent daytime napping. Significant disturbances may occur during sleep with aging (Table 14–1). Although some of the observed changes can be attributed to normal aging itself (eg, age-related alterations in circadian rhythms), most are due to comorbid medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and primary sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental disorders. Up to 20% of adults are affected by anxiety disorders each year. Generalized anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance Irritability The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause",

      "abstract": "Shift work sleep disorder is a common problem in industrialized countries because of the need for occupations and services to continue to function 24 hours/day. Approximately 20% of employed adults in the United States are engaged in shift work. Shift work sleep disorder is diagnosed if there is a report of insomnia or excessive sleepiness for at least 3 months associated with a recurring work schedule that overlaps the usual time for sleep. Shift work is associated with an increased occurrence of metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, and it has been implicated in weight gain and cognitive impairment. There is evidence of increased absenteeism in night workers compared with day workers. A planned sleep schedule, timed bright light exposure, timed melatonin administration, and stimulants or drugs promoting alertness can be used to manage shift work sleep disorder. Jet lag is characterized by a misalignment between internal circadian rhythms and local time caused by rapid travel across at least two time zones. Not all travelers experience jet lag; risk factors include age, number of time zones crossed, and circadian preference. Management includes timed melatonin along with optional timed and dosed bright light exposure.",

      "abstract": "The question as to whether the beneficial effect of sleep deprivation in depression is related to the increased wakefulness or to the sleep suppression by itself, is made moot by the search activity concept. According to this concept, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is functionally deficient in depression and increases feelings of helplessness and hopelessness instead of restoring mood and search activity. Thus, REM sleep deprivation, either selective or not, is beneficial by breaking a vicious circle: depression in wakefulness…giving up (helplessness) in dream scenario…increased depression in the subsequent wakefulness. In addition, sleep deprivation is an important challenge for the depressed patient. The ability to confront this challenge and maintain wakefulness has a positive outcome on depression, especially when wakefulness is accompanied by active behavior.",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

The occurrence of partial or complete UA obstruction during sleep characterizes the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome. Breathing (respiration), which is mainly under a behavioral or voluntary control system during awakening, is essentially under a metabolic or automated control system during sleep. The contribution of the thoracic cage to the overall respiration remains the same during wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Considering the importance of the metabolic regulation in the control of respiration during sleep, one can easily speculate that any change in the ventilatory response to hypoxic or hypercapnic stimuli will increase the magnitude of nocturnal hypoventilation episodes. UA are usually patent throughout the respiratory cycle and they behave in a manner similar to that of a Starling resistance model where a collapsible segment (pharynx) is located between two noncollapsible segments.",

A report of a 59-year-old patient with SRPE is described. Turgid painful erections (five to seven episodes of tumescence) during the sleep hours caused pain together with burning and tingling sensations in the penis and perineal zone during the daytime hours. Swelling of the pubic and perineal area was recurrent. Sleep loss, chronic fatigue, mild anxiety, lack of concentration and decreased work occurred along with this condition. Polysomnographic findings indicated REM sleep fragmentation. Attempts to treat this condition with muscle relaxants or anxiolytics did not prompt an improvement of this disorder, but a single daily dose of gabapentin 300 mg in combination with 1 mg clonazepam at bedtime improved total sleep time and reduced full sleep erections.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

A comprehensive sleep history, a sleep diary/log, and the BEARS (Bedtime problems, Excessive daytime sleepiness, Awakenings during the night, Regularity and duration of sleep, and Sleep-disordered breathing) sleep screen are useful for diagnosing sleep problems in young children. Behavioral therapies for this type of insomnia include extinction, bedtime fading with positive routines, and scheduled awakening. Previous studies of behavioral interventions for young children showed significant improvements in sleep-onset latency, night waking frequency, and night waking duration.

Nonetheless, there were certain unexpected regularities in his sleep-wake data, corresponding to fixed clock hours. Across the 4-year period, there were certain clock hours during which sleep onset and waking were likely to occur and certain clock hours that may be considered forbidden zones for sleep, during which the patient rarely either began or ended a sleep period. It is possible that the unexpected regularities resulted from partial entrainment to external cues or from some residual influence of an endogenous ultradian-regulating mechanism.",

Poor sleep due to these disorders results in increased risk of significant morbidity and mortality. As we age, sleep efficiency decreases as time spent in bed increases. Underlying sleep disorders are aggravated due to a decrease in the ability to get needed sleep.

Published prevalence estimates of insomnia vary considerably, very likely due to differences in definitions, study setting, and data collection methods. However, estimates based on large population-based surveys provide a rather constant prevalence rate for chronic insomnia in the United States of about 10% (approximately 25 million people). Chronic insomnia is associated with numerous physical and psychiatric conditions and is more common in women and the elderly. Although it is often perceived as a symptom of depression, insomnia is also a precursor of depression and is associated with a substantial increase in the relative risk of major depression. Chronic insomnia is correlated with impaired mood, subjective functioning, and quality of life and, in some cases, with increased daytime sleepiness and accident risk. Those reporting insomnia have higher rates of absenteeism and health care utilization. Direct costs of insomnia have been estimated to be $13.9 billion annually, with a large majority of costs attributable to nursing home care. Chronic insomnia is a common problem, often associated with negative waking mood or function. As such, heightened clinical attention and clinical research appear warranted.",

      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

Hypersomnia is excessive sleepiness or sleeping and has a variety of psychological or physiological causes. Epilepsy is a recurrent brain disorder of multiple etiologies and is characterized by recurrent seizures due to the excessive discharge of cerebral neurones.",

      "abstract": "textabstractBipolar disorder (also called manic-depressive illness) is one of the major mood disorders. The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

More common in children than adults, sleepwalking is usually outgrown by the teen years. Isolated incidents of sleepwalking often don't signal any serious problems or require treatment. However, recurrent sleepwalking may suggest an underlying sleep disorder. Sleepwalking in adults features a higher probability of being incoherent with or coexistent with different sleep disorders similarly as medical conditions. If anyone in your social unit sleepwalks, it is vital to shield him or her from potential injuries associated with sleeping.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

      "title": "Problemas para dormir—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Los problemas para dormir son comunes en los niños con y sin trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés). Entre la mitad y un tercio de los niños con TEA tienen problemas para dormir. Esto puede causar problemas durante el día, como falta de atención, irritabilidad o exhibición de más comportamientos repetitivos. La cantidad de horas de sueño durante la noche que necesitan los niños en edad preescolar, en general, es de 10 a 13 horas. A medida que crecen, el tiempo se reduce. Para los 13 años, la cantidad habitual de sueño necesaria es de entre 8 y 11 horas. Los problemas para dormir pueden afectar también a los padres y cuidadores, además del niño, porque los padres pierden horas de sueño al estar atendiendo a un niño que está despierto.Los niños con TEA pueden tener muchos motivos para no dormir. Las causas pueden ser médicas, de comportamiento o ambas. Las causas médicas de los problemas para dormir pueden incluir alergias, problemas para respirar y reflujo gastroesofágico (molestias estomacales).Los medicamentos también pueden afectar el sueño. Los motivos de comportamiento que causan problemas para dormir pueden ser cambios en las rutinas diarias o de la hora de acostarse, estrés en casa o en la escuela, cambio de cuidadores o cualquier otra cosa que rompa el patrón habitual de su hijo.El sueño tiene ciclos con distintos patrones de ondas cerebrales. Estos patrones pueden ser distintos en algunas personas con TEA. Es posible que las personas con TEA tengan el sueño más liviano y sueñen menos más tarde en la noche. Ese es el momento en que frecuentemente ocurre el despertar durante la noche. La hormona llamada melatonina es producida por el cerebro para controlar el sueño. Algunos estudios científicos muestran que las personas con TEA posiblemente no tengan la misma cantidad o actividad de melatonina.Algunos problemas para dormir incluyen:El médico de su hijo puede realizarle un examen físico general y obtener los antecedentes de problemas de salud y para dormir. Trate de llevar un diario del sueño durante un tiempo para ayudar al médico del niño a comprender los hábitos de sueño de su hijo. Informe al médico del niño si su hijo ronca fuerte o si tiene problemas de respiración por la noche y cualquier otra afección de salud que pudiera tener su hijo. El pediatra del niño podría pedirle pruebas si la historia clínica o el resultado del examen físico sugirieran que hay motivos médicos que causan los problemas de sueño.Los estudios han demostrado que las estrategias de comportamiento ayudan más que los medicamentos a mejorar los problemas para dormir. Estos son algunos pasos que pueden ayudar:En ocasiones, el solo hecho de crear buenos hábitos de sueño ayuda con los problemas para dormir, pero tal vez se necesiten otras medidas.Muchos niños con TEA responden a las órdenes y a las recompensas al intentar cambiar sus comportamientos. Repase junto a su hijo lo que espera que haga, con anticipación y nuevamente cada noche. Piense en la posibilidad de usar una tabla de imágenes o una historia para describir la rutina de la hora de acostarse. Si su hijo se ha quedado en la cama, ofrézcale una recompensa por la mañana, como un dulce que le guste, un juego o un ratito para usar pantallas.Si los problemas para dormir continúan después de establecer un buen lugar para que su hija duerma y una rutina para dormir adecuadas, tal vez desee agregar el paso de ignorarla cuando lo llame desde su cama. Cuando deje a su hija en la habitación, diga “buenas noches” y felicítela por irse a la cama. Luego vaya a controlarla en los momentos en que usted haya decidido hacerlo (generalmente cada pocos minutos) e ignórela entre los controles. Extienda el tiempo entre los controles durante la noche y en el transcurso de los días siguientes. Cuando vaya a controlar, échele un vistazo a la habitación. Si su hija está despierta, dígale que se duerma y luego váyase. No hay problema si su hija se duerme en el piso.Es muy importante que todos los cuidadores respeten este paso; hable con el resto de su familia sobre este plan antes de implementarlo. Si vive en un apartamento o condominio, tal vez también quiera hablar con sus vecinos. Los llantos y berrinches de su hija empeorarán durante varios días, pero con el tiempo mejorarán. Es fundamental que respete su plan y lo lleve adelante de la misma manera durante al menos 2 semanas, de principio a fin, para poder notar una diferencia. Tal vez necesite ayuda adicional para hacer esto, ya que puede ser difícil y agotador para padres y cuidadores.Algunos niños con TEA necesitan atención permanente para mantenerlos a salvo debido a sus comportamientos. Si su hija corre riesgo de lastimarse cuando no la esté supervisando y suele despertarse mucho durante la noche, pruebe las siguientes medidas de seguridad:El pediatra de su hija puede sugerir el uso de medicamentos recetados o de venta libre junto con el entrenamiento del comportamiento. Debe hablar con el médico de su hija antes de probar cualquier medicamento o suplemento herbal para su hija.Si aplicó este consejo todos los días durante 2 semanas y su hija sigue teniendo problemas para dormir, debe hablar con el pediatra de la niña. Hay otras intervenciones del comportamiento que se pueden usar.Los problemas muy difíciles deberán ser consultados con un experto en el sueño.La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

Desarrollo. El insomnio es un trastorno que se presenta como una dificultad para iniciar o mantener el sueno. La etiologia del insomnio infantil presenta causas multifactoriales. Para poder comprender y diagnosticar el insomnio en la infancia es necesario conocer los mecanismos que intervienen en la genesis de la vigilia y del sueno y considerar la existencia de otros tipos de trastornos. El insomnio se presenta como un desequilibrio entre la inhibicion de los sistemas que mantienen el estado de vigilia y de aquellos otros encargados de activar los sistemas generadores del sueno. En el nino, este desequilibrio depende de la situacion de inmadurez funcional propia de cada edad. El insomnio infantil aparece, mas que como una falta de sueno, como una falta de adecuacion entre el ritmo y la necesidad de sueno propia del nino y su entorno familiar y social. La causa mas habitual del insomnio es ambiental, conductual y de orden psicologico. Ante esta situacion, el diagnostico del insomnio infantil se basa en determinar un diagnostico diferencial con parasomnias, trastornos motores del sueno y del despertar. Conclusiones. El insomnio infantil plantea problemas para identificar sus causas, para diferenciar entre el autentico insomnio y otros trastornos del sueno y para su resolucion, debido a la influencia que el ambiente y la conducta del nino tienen sobre el sueno.",

      "abstract": "Assessment of motor development is an important part of the study of the neuropsychic development of children, which is carried out by a pediatrician during preventive examinations. To identify the causes of motor disorders, in addition to studying the anamnesis, it is necessary to conduct a physical examination of the child with the appointment of additional research methods. It is important to remember that developmental delay does not always indicate the presence of any disease but requires dynamic monitoring. However, if they progress, then these patients are more likely to be diagnosed with specific neuromuscular disorders. In this case, the pediatrician should pay attention to the neurological status of the child, assess visual acuity and hearing. At the same time, one should not forget that motor disorders are often combined with a general developmental delay (mental retardation) of the child. Fasciculation of the tongue, loss of motor skills, organomegaly, coarsening of facial features, increased levels of creatine phosphokinase (more than 3 times higher than normal), respiratory failure, in the presence of general weakness, a sharp deterioration in the child’s condition, accompanied by lethargy, vomiting, development of convulsive syndrome, disorders detected on MRI of the brain, are alarming symptoms that require urgent intervention by specialists (neurologist, genetics). Also, some hereditary (chromosomal and monogenic) diseases are often combined with the development of motor disorders. The best results are achieved if the early diagnosis of diseases accompanied by movement disorders is carried out using an interdisciplinary approach.",

Approximately 10% of the general population and 20% of primary care attendees suffer from severe insomnia. Clinical hallmarks of sleeplessness are the patients' complaints about insufficient and non-restorative sleep, severe daytime consequences without any tendency to fall asleep and presence of symptoms on three days per week for more than one month. Insomniacs tend to suffer from psycho-physiologic hyperarousal that prevents physical and mental relaxation. They are more susceptible to stress and seem to have a high sympathetic drive. Insomnia therefore has been compared to chronic caffeine intoxication. It must he pointed out that insomnia is probably more a qualitative rather than a quantitative disorder of sleep. Neither doctors nor patients routinely talk about disturbed sleep during consultations which might he one reason why insomnia very often goes undiagnosed. Consequently, physicians should routinely inquire afoul their patients' sleep and sleeping habits and take, if appropriate, a full sleep history on the basis of which further investigational and therapeutic steps can be planned: well-established tools of proved efficacy are available to treat both primary and secondary insomnia. Acute or transient insomnia lasting less than four weeks can he treated with hypnotics. Chronic insomnia is the domain of nonpharmacological psychotherapy, which can be conducted in a single or group setting.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric sleep-related health issues are more common and have significant impact on the health and well-being of the child. Approximately 25% of all children develop sleep problems ranging from difficulty falling asleep and night awakenings to more serious sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. The complications related to sleep disorder include cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive conditions as well as failure to thrive and growth retardation. Children also developed social and academic growth retardation. This chapter describes how to recognize, evaluate, and treat sleep disorders in children. This chapter also addresses sleep problems and special populations including pregnancy and menopausal states. Maternal sleep quality in the perinatal period begins to change; it has been noted that the greatest sleep disruption tends to occur approximately 1 week postpartum. Approximately 50% of women experience excessive daytime sleepiness at 18 weeks postpartum. Postpartum major depression is a serious illness that occurs in approximately 13% of mothers, negatively affecting both the mother's and child's psychological adjustment. Poor sleep clearly is a major confounder in maternal depression. Menopause is a time of change of life for women. By definition, menopause is considered when there has been the absence of menstrual periods for 1 year. Hormonal changes begin 7–10 years before the final menses. During this perimenopausal period, the pituitary-gonadal axis changes with decreasing estradiol and progesterone and rising FSH and LH.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "A person's well-being and health are greatly affected by disorders of sleep and wakefulness. It is of the utmost importance to diagnose and treat such conditions, since the associated daytime sleepiness is a major risk factor for accidents. Early establishment of the correct diagnosis paves the way to achieving an excellent therapeutic outcome. Health-economic requirements of appropriateness and necessity mandate the specific use of cost- and time-intensive examinations in the sleep laboratory. In accordance with the guidelines for \"non-restorative sleep\", severe and chronic sleep disorders can be diagnosed outside the sleep lab if the underlying cause can already be identified on the basis of the patient's history. Such is usually the case in sleep disorders caused by external influences, disturbed circadian rhythm or pre-existing neurological, psychiatric or internal disorders. Standardized questionnaires are used to record and evaluate the patient's complaints, and vigilance testing to assess impaired sustained attention during the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness is quantified by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In the case of some disorders such as apnoea, or periodic leg movements, simplified ambulatory methods have been developed to enable their detection at an early stage. The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep disorders in the sleep lab is cardiorespiratory polysomnography. The relevant biosignals for the assessment of sleep, respiration, heart function, the cardiovascular system and movement are well established. Some of the sensors employed need further improvement. Numerous methods for signal analysis are still undergoing development, and currently available automatic evaluation systems are not yet reliable enough to obviate the need for manual interpretation.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric sleep physiology begins with development of the sleep/wake cycle, and the origins of active versus quiet sleep. The 24-hour circadian cycle becomes established at 3-6 months. Sleep disorders during infancy commonly include mild, usually self-limited conditions such as sleep-onset association disorder, excessive nighttime feedings, and poor limit-setting. These require behavioral management to avoid long-term deleterious sleep habits. In contrast, other sleep disorders are more ominous, including SIDS, central congenital hypoventilation syndrome, and sleep apnea. Childhood is generally considered the golden age of sleep, with brief latency to sleep onset, high efficiency, and easy awakening. Yet parasomnias, psychological factors, and sleep disturbances associated with common disorders such as ADHD disrupt the idealistic notion of childhood being a period of unfettered sleep. Adolescents have sleep requirements similar to adults, posing a challenge for them to adapt to school schedules and increasingly demanding lifestyles. Narcolepsy, usually diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood, is a lifelong sleep disorder and has led to the identification of the hypocretin/orexin neurotransmitter system. Research advances in the complex interrelationships between developmental neurobiology, sleep disorders and behavior will lead to an enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of sleep problems and lead to novel therapeutic strategies for sleep disturbances in children.",

      "abstract": "It is well documented that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate disturbances in sleep continuity and sleep architecture as well as disrupted circadian rhythmicity. These sleep disturbances are associated with reduced quality of life and social functioning. Insomnia might be secondary to the hyperarousal caused by positive psychotic symptoms. However, in recent years, it has been acknowledged that insomnia often persists beyond adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment. Residual insomnia in schizophrenia, defined as insomnia persisting beyond otherwise adequate antipsychotic treatment, covers a range of insomnia symptoms that could be secondary to other potentially treatable conditions such as medical or psychiatric comorbidity, substance use, use of medication that might interfere with sleep or a primary sleep disorder. A thorough evaluation of the insomnia diagnosis is therefore warranted. This includes a careful patient history and examination that addresses sleep and wake function, as well as common medical, psychiatric and medication-/substance-related conditions. The complex problem of residual insomnia in schizophrenia is currently addressed by substituting or adding sedating drugs, but current treatment guidelines suffer from a lack of information on the best clinical practice. Substituting an otherwise efficient antipsychotic drug-therapy with a more sedating drug carries the risk of psychotic relapse during the switch, and adding another drug carries the disadvantages of polypharmacy including increased rate of side-effects, drug–drug interactions, patient non-compliance and medication errors. To investigate the evidence base for the different treatment options in residual insomnia in schizophrenia, we performed a systematic literature review. We searched the major bibliographic databases for randomized clinical trials (search terms: sleep and schizophren*) supplemented by review of reference lists of relevant articles. We found only five randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacological treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Two trials examined the efficacy of switching antipsychotic drug to, respectively, risperidone 1 or its active metabolite, paliperidone 2. The data suggest that risperidone might be a good choice for this particular indication, but methodological limitations and the lack of comparison with other second-generation antipsychotics weaken the suggestion. Three studies evaluating the efficacy of melatonin showed improvement in certain sleep characteristics (e.g. sleep duration and sleep efficiency) 3-5, but two of the studies 3, 4 came from the same group of researchers presumably using the same sample of patients. We found no published randomized clinical trials investigating non-pharmacological treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Thus, our attempt to review this clinically important subject was limited by the few interventions tested experimentally and difficulties making a thorough comparison of the tested interventions due to methodological limitations. These included small sample size, selective reporting, lack of specification of primary outcome measure and a high level of variability regarding assessment tools and allowed comedication. The benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) are frequently prescribed as hypnotics, but they have not been investigated for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. These drugs are generally only recommended for short-term therapy due to the development of tolerance and dependence. Because residual insomnia in schizophrenia is a chronic condition, these drugs are generally not recommendable. An additional reason to avoid prescription of benzodiazepines is their deteriorating effect on cognitive function and their impairment (rather than correction) of sleep architecture. Particular care should be taken in patients' comorbid for a sleep-related breathing disorder or a comorbid history of alcohol or drug abuse. Other possible treatment options mentioned in the literature, but not systematically investigated in schizophrenia, include add-on treatment with drugs with antihistamine properties including various antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines. They are extensively prescribed (or sold over-the-counter for some antihistamines), but scarce evidence exists regarding efficacy, tolerability and safety when used off-label as hypnotics. The use of classic antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) is limited by anticholinergic (including cognitive impairment) and cardiovascular adverse effects. Some evidence suggests the use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone (tricyclic antidepressants) as efficacious hypnotic drugs in primary insomnia and not associated with tolerance, weight gain or abuse potential. However, they have only been sparsely investigated in insomnia not associated with depression and are not available in all countries. The addition of a low-dose quetiapine as hypnotic agent has gained widespread acceptance without any evidence base of randomized controlled trials to support its use. Observational studies have found that even the low doses are associated with the development of adverse metabolic effects. In conclusion, the evidence base is currently too scarce to extract any valid clinical recommendations regarding the treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluation of the switching and augmenting strategies currently applied in clinical practice and also on evaluation of psychological behavioural treatment methods. The latter is especially important in this vulnerable population of patients already chronically medicated.

It is reported that the prevalence of chronic sleep-related complaints in older adults is over 50%, which is higher than that in younger adults. The etiology of sleep disorders in older adults is considered to be multifactorial, consisting of normal age-related changes(e.g., sleep fragmentation, earlier awakening, and decreased slow wave sleep), medical or psychiatric diseases (e.g., lifestyle-related diseases, dementia, delirium, and depression), primary age-related sleep disorders(e.g., sleep-related breathing disorders and periodic limb movement disorders), or a combination of these factors. Because sleep disorders in older adults may have implications for quality of life, it is crucial to distinguish normal age-related sleep changes from those originating from pathological processes. This mini-review discusses crucial points in the diagnosis and management of sleep disorders in older adults.",

Full blown REM sleep behaviour disorder can be diagnosed clinically, but REM sleep motor dysfunction, a pathophysiological basis of REM sleep behaviour disorder, is difficult to detect without all night polysomnography. Twenty one consecutive patients with multiple system atrophy with no complaints of nocturnal abnormal behaviours were clinically evaluated to determine the presence of sleep related symptoms. All night polysomnography with video monitoring was performed to investigate REM sleep characteristics and patients' behaviours. In 85.7% (18 of 21) of the patients' sleep talk started or increased around or after the clinical onset of the primary diseases. REM sleep without atonia occupied more than 15%(16.2%-100%) of the REM sleep time in all but one patient. In 90.5% (19 of 21) of patients, motor events such as sleep talk and various combinations of craniofacial, orofacial, or limb movements occurred at various frequencies mostly during REM sleep without atonia. In patients with multiple system atrophy, REM sleep motor dysfunction is a common polysomnographic finding which is otherwise overlooked, and sleep talk may be its early clinical manifestation.",

      "abstract": "Undisturbed sleep of sufficient length is essential for daytime alertness and performance, health and wellbeing. According to recent figures published by the WHO, sleep disturbance is one of the most deleterious non-auditory effects of environmental noise. A connection between noise exposure in the residential setting and detrimental effects on sleep and health is suggested by observational, experimental and epidemiological evidence that has been accumulated over the last decades. Maximum sound pressure levels as low as 33 dB have been shown to induce physiological reactions such as autonomic, motor, and cortical arousals (e.g., tachycardia, body movements, awakenings). Whether or not noise will induce such acute effects depends on the number of noise events and their acoustical properties, but also on situational moderators (e.g. momentary sleep stage) and individual noise sensitivity. Although clinical sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) have been shown to be associated with increased risks for cardiovascular diseases, only little is known about long-term effects of noise-disturbed sleep on cardiovascular health. In the past years, several hints have surfaced that undermine the suspicion that nocturnal noise exposure may be more relevant for the genesis of long term effects than daytime noise exposure. The paper reviews the present state of research in the domain of noise-induced sleep disturbances from transportation and other noise sources, compares exposure-effect functions, critically appraises methods for the assessment of noise effects on sleep, and reviews potential mechanisms of the genesis of long term health effects due to noise-induced sleep disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

      "abstract": "This chapter explores the causes, consequences, and countermeasures of jet lag, mistimed sleep, and sleep inertia. Jet lag can occur when rapidly crossing multiple time zones (e.g., trans-meridian travel for long-haul pilots). The desynchrony between the body's biological clock, or circadian rhythm, and the new day-night cycle can lead to indigestion, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive impairments. Mistimed sleep can also occur within a time zone. In the case of night shiftwork, sleep is displaced to the daytime which leads to poor sleep and increased fatigue at night due to the combination of pressures from the two-process model of sleep regulation: sleep loss (homeostatic pressure) and being awake when the body is promoting sleep (circadian pressure). There is also a third process of sleep regulation called sleep inertia, which refers to the brief period of fatigue and impaired cognitive performance experienced after waking. Sleep inertia can be a fatigue risk for transportation workers who work on-call (e.g., emergency services) or who nap on shift (e.g., long-haul truck drivers) and are required to perform a safety-critical task soon after waking. For each of these fatigue risks, strategic exposure to bright light can be used to help realign sleep timing and to promote alertness.",

After clinical interview the overnight polysomnography \"Sagura-2000\" (PSG) was performed. Sleep disorders in PTSD patients are characterized by the complex of subjective, clinical and neurophysiological symptoms: Superficial sleep (restless, lack of deep sleep); Increased motor activity during sleep (number of activations of the paradoxical phase of sleep to those of deep sleep); Nightmares; Specific (defensive) movements during sleep; Frequent nocturnal awakening (increased number and duration of awakenings); The excess of REM sleep. PSG identified the most frequently related nightmares neurodynamic phenomena: Deficiency of the deep sleep (stages 3 and 4 NREM); Up to 70% of the time NREM takes stage 2 sleep; The increase in motor and EEG activations; The number of activations of the REM than those of NREM; The increase in total REM sleep time; Increasing episodes of REM sleep.

Also, these dysfunctions can be the only observable manifestations of the disorder. It is particularly true in some epileptic syndromes with onset in childhood. Epileptic dysfunctions are characterized by a discontinuity in time (intermittent, recurrent), in space (cerebral localization of the dysfunction and its spread). They often have a significant relationship with sleep. These features, with sometimes the existential dimension of some symptoms (intermittent loss of the flux of consciousness, intermittent perceptual distortions or cognitive-emotional dysfunction) are not seen in any other congenital or acquired disorders of the human brain. Longitudinal clinical studies in which the epileptic variable can be directly correlated with the precise study of the cognitive dysfunction (also with increasingly complex methods of brain imaging) are a difficult, relatively new multidisciplinary task, especially in the very young child. Case examples of children followed from early childhood to adulthood will illustrate the diversity of observed cognitive and behavioural abnormalities directly caused by the epileptic activity which can be massive or very discrete. One is only beginning to document precisely the late consequences (or absence of) of some early childhood epilepsies that had a direct impact on developing brain function at some point.",

      "abstract": "Dear Editor, According to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), pain is defined as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated, or similar to that associated, with an actual or potential tissue injury” [1]. Chronic pain, in turn, is that which is persistent or recurrent for a period of at least three months, and sleep disturbances are often found in individuals with this condition [2]. There is a bidirectional relation between pain and sleep, with pain causing a reduction in the duration or quality of sleep, and disturbed sleep affecting the perception of pain by reducing pain thresholds [2]. Chronic shoulder pain is a complex syndrome involving biopsychosocial factors, with kinesiophobia, hypervigilance, catastrophizing, resilience, recovery expectation, and self-efficacy influencing the experience of pain [3]. Self-efficacy is defined as an individual's belief about their ability to perform a certain task and how to behave so that it can be achieved [4]. Therefore, it depends on a number of factors, including cognitive and emotional aspects, and can influence clinical outcomes in musculoskeletal conditions. Thus, knowledge on this topic can be included in pain education offered to patients to help them manage their own condition and reduce their dependence on health services [5]. Moreover, pain self-efficacy has been shown to be more influential on disability, behavior and pain intensity when compared to kinesiophobia and thought catastrophizing in individuals with shoulder pain [3].",

Although insomnia is not considered a serious life-threatening condition, it has not only a high prevalence rate but also a high recurrence rate and tends to become chronic. Chronic insomnia patients tend to show common behavioral and cognitive patterns, typical of which are worrying about not being able to fall or stay asleep, excessive awakening because of this worry, limiting and reducing daytime activities or attempting to stay in bed for long periods to compensate for lack of sleep. These cognitive and behavioral characteristics are important contributing factors for the continuation of insomnia. To date, the most popular and effective treatment option/approach recommended by experts for insomnia is cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT for insomnia consists of the following three non-pharmaceutical treatment elements: 1) behavioral elements such as stimulus control therapy, sleep restriction therapy, and muscle relaxation, 2) cognitive elements, and 3) educational elements focusing on sleep hygiene. However, there are barriers to insomnia patients receiving this treatment including accessibility and cost, despite the abundance of evidence demonstrating their effectiveness. Recently, online CBT for insomnia has become available as an alternative, and its emergence is providing a solution to the barriers to access.",

      "abstract": "Premature survivors are at increased risk for impaired neurodevelopmental outcome compared to full terms. These sequelae include cognitive abnormalities, mild fine or gross motor delay, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing losses, impairment increases with decreasing gestational age. Persistence of multiple abnormal neurologic signs in the first 12 to 18 months is ominous. Emergence of other findings (vision impairments, seizures, feeding issues delay of head growth) is associated with poor outcome. MRI is useful in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome at the equivalent of term gestation. Other neonatal complications as; bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, poor growth, presence of congenital anomalies are associated with an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Premature survivors are more likely to have specific psychological and behavioral problems including attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, general anxiety, and depression. Individuals with birth weights below 1500 g are at greater risk for poor academic performance than those born with normal birthweight because of their impaired cognition, neurosensory defects, and behavioral and psychological problems. Neurodevelopmental outcome is assessed more accurately at school age than in early childhood due to the cognitive recovery over time and lack of accurate predictive assessment tools in early childhood. Survivors of prematures need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental impairment and, if impairment is present, be referred to educational programs and subspecialty care in order to provide the best possible outcome. ELBW infants without evidence of significant neonatal brain injury can recover when exposed to a nurturing home environment and comprehensive early intervention services.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "abstract": "The amount, timing, and structure of REM sleep are regulated. Three major determinants in REM sleep regulation have been identified: (1) the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which through its outputs generates daily cycles in REM sleep propensity; (2) a homeostatic (i.e., need-based) drive for REM sleep that increases in the absence of REM sleep and decreases during its presence; (3) the inhibition of REM sleep by non-REM (NREM) sleep. In humans, the circadian modulation of REM sleep shows a maximum shortly after the nadir of the circadian rhythm of core body temperature. A sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep (i.e., a gradual increase of REM sleep in the course of a sleep episode that is distinct from a circadian influence) is also evident and attributed primarily to the decrease in NREM sleep intensity. The circadian rhythm and the sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep are the dominant factors influencing the distribution of REM sleep within a sleep episode. In humans that are normally entrained to the 24-hour day, the interaction of these two factors results in maximal REM sleep propensity in the morning, coinciding with habitual wake time. The homeostatic regulation counteracts deviations from a reference level of REM sleep need such that loss of REM sleep results in increased REM sleep propensity. However, rebounds in REM sleep following selective deprivation often remain partial suggesting that the homeostatic drive is relatively weak. On the other hand, recent studies have emphasized that REM sleep can undergo changes in its quality that may compensate for its loss in duration. In the present chapter, the evidence for circadian and homeostatic regulation of REM sleep will be reviewed, the physiological markers that are indicative of such regulation will be presented, and the interdependence of REM sleep and NREM sleep regulation will be examined.",

In addition, 30-40% of adults report complaints about sleep quality lifetime, and10-15% report chronic insomniaBenzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia and sleep disorders. BZDs show a rapid sedative and anxiolytic effect, successfully used in the acute treatment of insomnia as well as anxiety, agitation, or anxiety associated with any type of psychiatric disorder. Their use is associated with potential side effects such as residual daytime sleepiness, ataxia, and dizziness. Long-term BZDs use may lead to drug abuse, tolerance, drug dependency, and abstinence. For instance, BZDs abrupt withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms such as insomnia and/or rebound anxiety, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, nausea and/or vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, convulsions, and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Objectives This e-poster aimed to summarize evidence regarding the effect of BZDs treatment on human Sleep Architecture. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: benzodiazepines, sleep architecture, insomnia. Results Prolonged use of benzodiazepines leads to an increase of time spent in stages 2 and a decrease of time in stages 1, 3, and 4. The increased NREM stage 2 is associated with a subjective improvement in sleep quality. The decrease in NREM sleep time in stages 3 and 4 is usually associated with lesser “rest” for the brain, which leads to a lack of concentration. Conclusions BZDs use modified sleep architecture in the short and long term. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Nocturnal enuresis and sleep terrors tend to be more common in childhood anxiety disorders, such as separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism. Poor sleep quality is seen in adults with anxiety disorders such as specific phobia, social phobia, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Objective data obtained from polysomnograms support this claim in many instances. Nocturnal panic occurs frequently in patients with sleep apnea and may predispose to the development of panic disorder. Insomnia is a trait marker for depression, and may also be one for anxiety disorders.

Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is defined as difficulties of initiating and maintaining sleep, early awakening and poor subjective sleep quality despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep with impairment of daytime performance. These components of insomnia – namely persistent sleep difficulties despite of adequate sleep opportunity resulting in daytime dysfunction - appear secondary or co-morbid to neurological diseases. Comorbid insomnia originates from neurodegenerative, inflammatory, traumatic or ischemic changes in sleep regulating brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei with consecutive changes of neurotransmitters. Symptoms of neurological disorders (i.e motor deficits), co-morbidities (i.e. pain, depression, anxiety) and some disease-specific pharmaceuticals may cause insomnia and/or other sleep problems. This guideline focuses on insomnias in headaches, neurodegenerative movement disorders, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, epilepsies, stroke, neuromuscular disease and dementia. The most important new recommendations are: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBTi) is recommended to treat acute and chronic insomnia in headache patients. Insomnia is one of the most frequent sleep complaints in neurodegenerative movement disorders. Patients may benefit from CBTi, antidepressants (trazodone, doxepin), melatonin and gaba-agonists. Insomnia is a frequent precursor of MS symptoms by up to 10 years. CBTi is recommended in patients with MS, traumatic brain injury and. Melatonin may improve insomnia symptoms in children with epilepsies. Patients with insomnia after stroke can be treated with benzodiazepine receptor agonists and sedating antidepressants. For patients with dementia suffering from insomnia trazodone, light therapy and physical exercise are recommended.",

Such forces disrupt normal cellular processes in the brain. Concussions are seen in all age, gender and ethnic groups but, because they are commonly sustained during sports and recreational activities, they have frequently been described in children. The estimated incidence of sports-related concussions in the USA ranges from 300000 to 3.8 million annually. 2 Estimating incidence is difficult because sports-related concussions frequently go undetected due to a lack of recognition of symptoms or intentional underreporting of symptoms. 34 Symptoms include physical complaints (eg, headache, fatigue, dizziness, noise intolerance), behavioural changes (eg, mood swings, depression, anxiety, irritability) and cognitive impairment (eg, inability to concentrate, decreased memory). While initial symptoms typically resolve in several days to occasionally several months after the injury, 5e8 in 10e15% these symptoms can persist much longer. Because of the heterogeneity of these injuries and their recovery, as well as the recognition that the length of time until symptoms resolve is more important clinically than the type of symptoms, grading scales and classification schemes have been abandoned.

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

A variety of medical and psychiatric factors may also produce marked sleep disruption. All of these factors are in this chapter. A recent randomised double-masked placebo-controlled trial in children with neurodevelopmental disorders showed that melatonin reduced sleep onset latency but at the same time was associated with earlier waking time than placebo. Melatonin is not generally considered to produce tolerance, rebound insomnia or dependency, problems often associated with other sedative hypnotics.

The misalignment of the internal sleep-wake circadian clock with environmental day/night patterns and other environmental cues may also result in sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Swallowing is a dynamic process that requires more than 30 muscles in the recruitment/coordination of the lips, tongue, palate, pharynx, larynx and esophagus. The eating and swallowing procedure is learned in sensitive or critical periods: when a certain degree of maturation has been achieved, the appropriate stimulus permits a certain milestone of development to occur. The swallowing procedure occurs in three main stages oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Therefore, swallowing disorders may present in any, some, or all of these stages in addition to feeding problems. Adult dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, has long been reported in the literature. Infants and children also experience feeding disorders and swallowing problems, either because of developmental disorders, syndromes, behavioral or neurological conditions, respiratory problems, and/or gastroesophageal reflux, eosinophilic esophagitis or anatomical deficits. Feeding problems or dysphagia are seen in up to 25% of all children; approximately 40% of prematurely born infants have swallowing disorders, up to 64-78% with developmental disorders and up to 99% with cerebral palsy. Diagnostic options include health status, broad social environment, parent-child interactions, and parental concerns. Evaluation of dysphagia and feeding disorders involves a multifactorial approach. Imaging studies may include videofluoroscopy and/or fiberoptic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Successful oral feeding must be measured in quality of meal time experiences with best possible oral sensorimotor skills and safe swallowing while not jeopardizing a child's functional health status or the parent-child relationship. An interdisciplinary team approach enables coordinated global assessment and therapy planning.",

      "title": "Practical Consequences of Fatigue-Related Performance Failures",
      "abstract": "THE FACT THAT TIRED PEOPLE DO NOT PERFORM AS WELL AS WELL-RESTED PEOPLE DO IS A TRUISM THAT HAS BEEN LONG CONFIRMED BY CAREFUL EMPIRIC study in the laboratory.1 What is less obvious is the way in which fatigue manifests itself in performance changes. At one extreme, the fatigued subject may be in a microsleep (or, indeed, full sleep), in which case there will be a missed or tardy response. Such effects are often best detected by measuring lapses (unduly slow responses), for example, in the Psychomotor Vigilance Task. This was shown nicely in a study of repeated sleep restriction,2 in which the number of lapses increased as the week of restricted sleep progressed. However, even without microsleeps, there can be a general slowing in information-processing speed.3 Others4 have argued that sleep loss results in a loss of cognitive creativity, as indicated by a tendency to use old information processing strategies, even though they are no longer optimal or even practical. Certainly, from all viewpoints, the more extreme (and/or chronic) the sleep loss and the longer and more boring the task, the more likely performance decrements are to occur.5\r\n\r\nIn most real-world situations, the worst consequences of fatigue result not from a response slowing from 200 milliseconds to 750 milliseconds, for example, but from a major cognitive or attention failure—something many in the field refer to as a loss of situational awareness.6,7 This loss manifests itself in the operator no longer responding appropriately, or perhaps even responding completely inappropriately, to the situation. Thus, in hindsight, it is clear to the individual concerned that an error was made or that an important feature of the situation was missed. Sometimes this loss of situational awareness results in a catastrophe such as Three Mile Island or Exxon Valdez8; at other times, the situation is saved by additional levels of safety control, resulting in only a near miss. A recent (4/10/2007) public letter from Mark Rosenker, the chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), to Marion Blakely, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and to the Air Traffic Controllers' (ATC) union gives a useful insight into such real-world examples. The letter discusses one recent catastrophe and four recent near misses in the field of commercial aviation that may have resulted from a loss of situational awareness related to fatigue. It also gives the sleep community a compelling case for continuing their public campaign against chronic sleep loss and in furthering the study of the performance consequences of such loss. The full text of the letter is available on the NTSB public website at http://www.ntsb.gov/recs/letters/2007/A07_30_32.pdf.\r\n\r\nIn his letter, NTSB Chairman Rosenker expressed concern about accidents and near misses perhaps attributable to ATC personnel working while fatigued. He noted that the NTSB had long been concerned with the effects of fatigue in persons involved in critical functions and the dangers to safety that arose as a consequence. He also documented the large number of suggestions that the NTSB had made to the FAA over the years with the aim of improving the situation and noted that few of them appeared to have been acted upon. In the beginning of his letter, Chairman Rosenker discussed a recent (8/27/2006) fatal air crash at Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe airplane had been cleared by air traffic control (ATC) for takeoff on runway 22, which is 7,003 feet long and equipped with high-intensity runway lights; however, the crew mistakenly taxied onto runway 26, which is 3,500 feet long and unlighted, and attempted to take off. The airplane ran off the end of runway 26, impacted the airport perimeter fence and trees, and crashed. Of the 47 passengers and 3 crew members on board the airplane, 49 were killed, and one received serious injuries… During its ongoing investigation of this accident, the Safety Board has learned that the air traffic controller who cleared the accident airplane for takeoff had worked a shift from 0630 to 1430 the day before the accident, then returned 9 hours later to work the accident shift from 2330 until the time of the accident at 0607 the next morning. The controller stated that his only sleep in the 24 hours before the accident was a 2-hour nap the previous afternoon between these 2 shifts.\r\n\r\nThe NTSB chairman also gave four examples of near misses from Chicago (3/23/2006), Los Angeles (8/19/2004), Denver (9/25/2001), and Seattle (7/8/2001), all potentially involving fatigued ATCs. In all four cases, a loss of situational awareness may have been to blame. In three cases, the ATC put two planes on a collision course on the same runway; in the fourth, the controller failed to notice that the pilot had selected the wrong runway (which was closed for repair). Here is the Los Angeles example.\r\n\r\nA controller cleared a Boeing 737 passenger airplane to taxi onto and take off from runway 24L at the same time that another passenger airplane, a Boeing 747, had been cleared to land on the same runway and was on a short final approach. The pilots in the landing airplane saw the 737 taxi onto the runway and discontinued their approach about 12 seconds before the impending collision would have occurred, passing approximately 200 feet above the 737 during the go-around. The investigation determined that when the controller began working the local control position, he received a correct position-relief briefing that the 747 was approaching runway 24L. The controller later indicated that he subsequently developed a mistaken belief that the 747 was landing on the adjacent parallel runway 24R. The investigation determined that the controller had worked a shift the previous evening from 1530 until 2330, then went home and slept between 5 and 6 hours before returning to work the incident shift, which began at 0730. The controller described the portion of his shift before the incident as a “hard day” and attributed his error, in part, to fatigue.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem may concern shift work and overtime, both of which can have a potentially negative impact on the amount of sleep obtained. It is perhaps no coincidence that all 5 incidents occurred immediately after a short return, i.e., a break of only 9 hours between the end of one shift and the start of another. Short returns have been cited as the major problem with regard to backward (phase advance) rotating shifts.9 Such issues can often be worsened by a shortage of qualified personnel to fill positions and an aging workforce. Many in the FAA undoubtedly care deeply about the ATC fatigue issue, and there has been some FAA research activity in this regard and have been a few attempts at employee education. However, as the NTSB letter notes, “The findings that controllers have minimal recollection of the FAA's previously disseminated fatigue-related information and poor awareness of fatigue-related issues and that they inconsistently apply personal strategies for maximizing restorative sleep suggest that safety could be improved by providing more intensive training to controllers on shift-work and fatigue-related issues.”\r\n\r\nThe examples given in the NTSB letter reinforce the need for the sleep community to continue to study the issue of insufficient sleep leading to a loss of situational awareness, even though such experiments may be difficult to design and execute. The NTSB letter also suggests a useful roadmap by which elected officials, the FAA, their employees, other government agencies and the traveling public can be better educated regarding the negative consequences of fatigue and the various ways in which such negative consequences can be ameliorated or avoided. The sleep community is ideally suited to take an active role in this endeavor by ensuring the development and implementation of scientifically accurate education and outreach tools.",

It is a question of characterizing bruxism in connection with not only dental problems but also sleep disorders.

Bruxism would be caused by central factors (neuropathic or psycho-emotional) involving the central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic (ANS) modulated among other things by sleep and the psychic state. In addition, certain local factors can maintain the parafunction: breathing disorders and sleep parasomnia in particular revealing a pattern of intricate cause-consequences.

      "title": "The condition of insomnia: Etiopathogenetic considerations and their impact on treatment practices",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.",

      "title": "Arousal in Nocturnal Consciousness: How Dream- and Sleep-Experiences May Inform Us of Poor Sleep Quality, Stress, and Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "The term \"sleep experiences\", coined by Watson (2001), denotes an array of unusual nocturnal consciousness phenomena; for example, nightmares, vivid or recurrent dreams, hypnagogic hallucinations, dreams of falling or flying, confusional arousals, and lucid dreams. Excluding the latter, these experiences reflect a single factor of atypical oneiric cognitions (\"general sleep experiences\"). The current study is an opinionated mini-review on the associations of this factor—measured with the Iowa sleep experiences survey (ISES, Watson, 2001)—with psychopathological symptoms and stress. Findings support a strong relation between psychological distress and general sleep experiences. It is suggested that that they should be viewed as a sleep disturbance; they seem to represent involuntary intrusions of wakefulness into sleep, resulting in aroused sleep. These intrusions may stem from excessively thin boundaries between consciousness states (e.g., \"transliminality\"), or, conversely, they may follow an attempt at disconnecting mental elements (e.g., dissociation), which paradoxically results in a \"rebound effect\". The extent to which unusual dreaming is experienced as intrusive, rather than controlled, may explain why general sleep experiences are related to psychopathology, whereas lucid dreams are related to psychological resilience. In conclusion, the exploration of the interplay between psychopathology and sleep should be expanded from focusing almost exclusively on quantitative aspects (e.g., sleep efficiency, latency) to including qualitative conscious experiences which may reflect poor sleep quality. Taking into account nocturnal consciousness—including unusual dreaming and permeable sleep-wake boundaries—may unveil rich information on night-time emotional states and broaden our definition of poor sleep quality.",

      "title": "A Comparative Study of Anxiety Level of Enuretic and Non-Enuretic Children",
      "abstract": "Enuresis is more commonly known as bed-wetting. Enuresis is diagnosed when children repeatedly urinate in inappropriate places, such as clothing (during the day) or the bed (during the night). In most cases, the child’s urination problem is involuntary in nature, and is perceived by the child as an unavoidable loss of urinary control. This condition is most likely a symptom of psychological stress, although physiological causes, such as bladder infection, should not be ruled out. In general, the causes of bedwetting are related to anxiety, life stress, and possibly trauma, both inside and outside the home. Psychological factors such as a stressful life situation (death of a parent) or birth of a new sibling, disturbed family patterns, and delay toilet training, personality characteristics, parenting style, anxiety or presence of other emotional problems may predispose factors of enuresis. Many Children with enuresis experience significant distress or impairment in their social, academic, or everyday lives and the disorder can also drastically affect their families. The aim of the study is to find out the Anxiety level of Enuretic and Non-Enuretic Children.Test Anxiety Scale for Children (TASC) questionnaire made by A. kumar to determine anxiety level administered over 80 (Boys and girls) children of enuretic and non-enuretic. Result showed that there is significant difference in anxiety level of enuretic and non-enuretic children (p&lt;.01).",

It discusses the prevention of sleep loss through the use of sleep-promoting medications. However, much insomnia secondary to medical illness and primary sleep disorders appear to have physiological and behavioral effects similar to those of sleep deprivation. Sleepiness is an inevitable result of sleep deprivation, and when the magnitude of sleepiness is high, the risk of inattention, poor performance, negative mood, and accidents is great. Jet lag was discussed under transient insomnia as sleep disruptive. However, it is the circadian-mediated sleepiness during desired or required waking hours that is often the most problematic component of the jet lag syndrome. Evidence that treatment of transient insomnia reduces or eliminates the sequelae of acute sleep deprivation outside of a laboratory environment is lacking. The frequent predictability of transient insomnia provides opportunity for prevention.",

      "title": "Daytime functioning and quality of life in chronic insomnia: a multi-method, multi-level approach",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is characterised by difficulties with initiating and/or maintaining sleep. Similar to most psychiatric and mental health conditions, insomnia is defined according to subjective complaint, and achieves disorder ‘status’ when associated daytime functioning impairment is present. Yet, ironically, it is these two cornerstones of insomnia disorder, combined, that have achieved relatively minimal attention in the literature. That is, perhaps surprisingly, the subjective experience, and impact of insomnia, at least from the patient (‘expert’) perspective, has been under-researched. Night-time symptoms and sleep parameters have typically been the target of both treatment and non-treatment (clinical, epidemiological, mechanistic) research.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, a multi-method, multi-level approach is adopted to better understand the daytime experience of those with chronically disturbed sleep. First, a brief overview (chapter one) of insomnia is provided to familiarise the reader with the ‘problem of insomnia’. A narrative review (chapter two) then sets the scene in relation to the assessment and measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and daytime functioning. This work reveals several inadequacies and limitations of existing work, and outlines a prospective research agenda. \r\n\r\nChapter three describes the first ever phenomenological study carried out in primary insomnia patients. Here, two qualitative methodologies, focus groups and audio-diaries, are combined to help better understand the proximal and distal impairments attributed to chronic sleep disturbance. Chapter four builds on this work by describing the creation of two new clinical scales, developed to quantify, in both valid and novel ways, the impact of poor sleep on aspects of daytime functioning and insomnia-related quality of life.\r\n\r\nChapter five combines the aforementioned qualitative and questionnaire approaches to explore the experience of an effective behavioural intervention for insomnia, sleep restriction therapy (SRT). The application of these refined methods provided insight into the effects of SRT on both sleep and daytime functioning, but also permitted exploration of treatment-related issues - such as adherence, side-effects, and mechanisms of action - that have otherwise been difficult to probe using traditional quantitative methodologies.\r\n\r\nChapter six tackles the issue of objective daytime impairment, typically assessed using computerised reaction time tasks. Through ‘mining’ an existing brain and behavioural database, and applying an algorithm to select poor and normal sleepers, it was possible to investigate cognitive functioning at two broad stages of processing – event-related potentials generated from the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), and performance output using neuropsychological testing. The results provide some interesting hypotheses concerning possible cognition-arousal and -effort interactions. Importantly, as a by-product of this work, a methodological template for the future standardized assessment of brain and behavioural function in insomnia is considered.\r\n\r\nFinally, chapter seven synthesises the results of each preceding experimental chapter, with particular emphasis on how this work will advance research, measurement and understanding of insomnia-related functioning. Immediate clinical implications and relevance to other areas of insomnia research are also briefly considered.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population and are associated with adverse effects such as motor vehicle collisions, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized into three groups: people with problems falling asleep, people with behavior and movement disturbances during sleep, and people with excessive daytime sleepiness. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is defined by difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or both, resulting in daytime consequences. Insomnia is diagnosed by history and is treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without medications. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in patients acting out their dreams with potentially harmful effects. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is diagnosed by polysomnography and treated with melatonin or clonazepam. Restless legs syndrome is defined by an urge to move the legs that worsens when at rest. Restless legs syndrome is treated with gabapentin or dopamine agonists, depending on the severity. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep hallucinations. Diagnosis is suggested by the history and can be confirmed with polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test the following day. Narcolepsy is treated with behavior modifications and medications such as stimulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sodium oxybate, and pitolisant. Obstructive sleep apnea may be diagnosed in patients with excessive snoring and witnessed apneas and can be diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Treatment consists of positive airway pressure therapy while sleeping in conjunction with weight loss.",

Using correlational studies and structural analyses, evidence is provided that unusual sleep experiences, dissociation, and schizotypy belong to a common domain. It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue). The paper also outlines the methodological limitations of the existing evidence and makes suggestions for future research. Finally, three models for the overlap of daytime and nighttime symptoms are reviewed, including biological abnormalities, trauma, and personality traits. Although further research is needed, it is suggested that daytime and nighttime symptoms result from problems with sleep-wake state boundaries, which may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition, association between daytime and nighttime symptoms can be attributed to the higher order personality trait of Oddity.",

There are multifactorial causes involved in the aetiology of childhood insomnia. In order to understand and diagnose insomnia in childhood it is necessary to have a good knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the genesis of sleeping and waking. We must also take the possible existence of other types of disorders into consideration. Insomnia appears as an imbalance between the systems that maintain the waking state and those that are in charge of activating sleep generating systems. In children, this imbalance depends on the state of functional immaturity peculiar to each age. Rather than a shortage of sleep, childhood insomnia takes the form of a lack of matching between the child s own rhythm or need to sleep and his or her family or social environment. Insomnia is most frequently caused by environmental, behavioural and psychological factors. A correct diagnosis of childhood insomnia has to be based on determining a procedure to differentiate it from parasomnias or motor disorders affecting waking and sleep.Identifying the causes of childhood insomnia, differentiating it from real insomnia and other sleep disorders, and resolving it are no simple matter because of the influence exerted by the environment and the child s behaviour on how he or she sleeps.",

      "title": "Ask About Daytime Sleepiness!",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is being recognized increasingly as a significant public health problem.1 Sleep loss or inadequate sleep time is the most common cause of EDS in the general population.1–3 Primary sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, and periodic leg movements in sleep are prevalent, particularly among older persons, and can contribute to EDS.4 Other medical conditions, such as cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, psychiatric illness, chronic pain syndromes, and several neurologic and neurodegenerative disorders, can disrupt sleep and lead to EDS. Moreover, widely prescribed medications, including diuretics, antihypertensives, sympathomimetic agents, corticosteroids, sedative-hypnotics, analgesics, and certain antidepressants, can cause EDS by interfering with sleep continuity and/or by having a direct sedating effect in the daytime. The adverse consequences of EDS are numerous. Irrespective of the underlying cause, hypersomnolence is associated with neurocognitive deficits, including decrements in attention, vigilance, and memory.5 Evidence also supports a strong association between EDS and an increased risk for domestic, work-related, and motor vehicle accidents.6,7 Impaired general health status and limitations in activities of daily living are yet other common sequela.8,9 Furthermore, landmark epidemiologic studies such as the Honolulu Heart Program and the Cardiovascular Health Study have associated EDS with a higher prevalence of heart disease, congestive heart failure, and dementia.10,11 The important report by Newman et al. in this issue extends our understanding by documenting an independent association between EDS and incident cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. In addition, the gender differences noted in the current investigation are consistent with previous reports of the high prevalence of sleep complaints among women and with the association of sleep disordered breathing with increased mortality in women in the nursing home setting.12 The causal pathway between EDS and morbid events, including cognitive dysfunction, accidents, and impaired quality of life, is readily envisioned. The occurrence of brief “microsleeps” and even prolonged sleep episodes in the daytime can decrease vigilance and lead to compromised performance at home, work, or during safety-sensitive tasks such as driving. Moreover, the inability to maintain wakefulness during the day can have a deleterious influence on social functioning and can lower one's sense of well-being. See also p 115 Yet unresolved, however, are the mechanisms through which EDS relates independently to cardiovascular end-points and mortality. At least three different causal pathways are proposed. First, it is possible that the increased morbidity and mortality associated with EDS are a function of underlying sleep disorders that cause EDS. It is well established that sleep-disordered breathing is prevalent in the general population. In middle-aged adults the prevalence is estimated to be at least 2 to 4%, and in certain subgroups it may be much higher.13 Several investigators have shown that the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing increases with age, with estimates that perhaps 30 to 40% of older individuals may have this chronic disorder.12,14,15 Recent work indicates that the frequency of disordered breathing events, severity of associated oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and degree of sleep fragmentation contribute independently to the occurrence of EDS.16 Clinic- and population-based studies have also shown an association between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension and prevalent cardiovascular disease independent of the effects of age, gender, smoking, and obesity.17 Therefore, in this setting, morbidity and mortality caused by EDS reflect underlying primary sleep disorders that are, in turn, associated with cardiovascular end-points and mortality. Second, many of the chronic medical conditions that are prevalent in older people, such as coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, emphysema, and depression, can be related indirectly to EDS through their interference with nocturnal sleep quality. It is now appreciated that congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease can predispose to sleep-disordered breathing, which can potentially exacerbate the predisposing condition.18,19 As with the occurrence of a primary sleep disorder, EDS in this setting is merely a surrogate marker for these chronic ailments, Third, it is possible that EDS has a direct role, through an undefined mechanism, in increasing morbidity and mortality, independent of either underlying primary sleep disorders or other recognized chronic medical illnesses. Experimental sleep deprivation studies in normal volunteers demonstrate a heightened sympathetic drive with elevated levels of circulating catecholamines.20,21 Extensive data indicate that sleep deprivation is also linked with significant alterations in the neuroendocrine axis characterized by an increase in serum Cortisol levels and a slower rate of daylong decline following the early morning circadian elevation.21,22 In the context of multiple chronic illnesses that are common among older adults, such neurohumoral alterations can increase further the probability of precipitating adverse events and require further delineation. Daytime sleepiness is assessed either objectively or subjectively. Objective methods include the multiple sleep latency test and the maintenance of wakefulness test.21–24 The former is used commonly in the clinical setting and many consider it to be the gold standard for the assessment of sleepiness. Subjective methods utilize self-report to identify sleep propensity and include validated questionnaires such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale.24,25 Since patients often underestimate their own degree of sleepiness, validated questionnaires addressing the likelihood of feeling drowsy or falling asleep during specific activities are more effective than general inquiries regarding the presence or absence of EDS. Moreover, questions about specific sleep-wake habits and input from family members, bed partners, and/or caregivers can provide a more accurate estimate of the degree and functional impact of EDS. In their study, Newman et al. use a general inquiry for identifying sleep-related problems and daytime sleepiness, raising the possibility of some degree of misclassification in their exposure variable (i.e., daytime sleepiness). In another recent prospective population-based study, the presence of self-reported snoring and general EDS was associated with total death rate and cardiovascular mortality. This effect was age-dependent and persisted after adjustment for body mass index, history of hypertension, cardiac disease, and diabetes. Interestingly, isolated snoring or hypersomnolence were not associated with increased mortality.26 In each of these investigations, the use of validated questionnaires to assess EDS and information regarding the presence of documented sleep-related disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing) would have been invaluable in examining the true independent effect of EDS on cardiovascular endpoints and all-cause mortality and the pathogenesis of this relationship. Newer initiatives sponsored by the National Institutes of Health have addressed some of the limitations of these important initial studies. The Sleep Heart Health Study, a multi-site longitudinal cohort study, is investigating the links between sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular endpoints.27 Until such prospective data clarify these relationships, we believe that currently available evidence supports the simple, noninvasive measure of asking our patients about their sleep and, in particular, about the presence of inappropriate hypersomnolence. All healthcare professionals have an important role in recognizing EDS as a sign and symptom that is amenable to effective treatment, The time-honored notion that somnolence is an expected (and accepted) concomitant of normal aging requires reevaluation: EDS that intrudes on daytime function not only compromises the quality of life but may also threaten lifespan. Despite the high prevalence of primary and secondary sleep problems among older persons, health professionals have often not prioritized the sleep history essential to recognition of potentially treatable conditions, and an important opportunity for health promotion is lost.28 We can and must do better.",

Because these disorders manifest themselves highly variably among children of any given age, and even in an individual affected child, they need an appropriate diagnostic evaluation so that the many environmental and background factors that may be relevant to the further course of the problem can be assessed.Extensive data were obtained on approximately 1400 children who were tested before beginning school in 2005 by means of a special sleep questionnaire and another screening instrument that is used to assess behavioral strengths and difficulties (the SDQ, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire).Five percent of the children were found to have difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or nocturnal awakening. Less frequent problems included parasomnias such as pavor nocturnus (0.5%), sleepwalking (0.1%), and frequent nightmares (1.7%).Sleep disorders increase the risk of daytime fatigue and of psychological problems in general, including both hyperactivity and excessive emotional stress.

      "title": "Sleep Paralysis",
      "abstract": "Sleep paralysis is a fairly common, yet often unrecognized and underreported condition, experienced by up to 10% of the general population at some point in their lives. This rapid eye movement (REM)-intrusion phenomenon occurs when the muscle atonia from REM sleep pervades into wakefulness. Patients often experience a conscious awareness of their surroundings, coupled with a sense of suffocation and significant clinical distress, usually lasting for seconds up to several minutes. Though it is often associated with narcolepsy, sleep paralysis can be seen in any condition where there is sleep disruption and is most commonly seen in younger patients who have significant sleep deprivation or insufficient sleep. It is also associated with other common sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, and can be part of the differential diagnosis for numerous other related conditions such as nightmares, sleep terrors, and nocturnal panic attacks. Obtaining a comprehensive sleep history is essential in accurately characterizing episodes, and for determining the underlying etiology. Treatment of sleep paralysis is largely focused on preventing sleep disruption, and with reassurance and education. Pharmacologic therapy with tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be considered in severe and refractory cases.",

      "abstract": "Disordered sleep affects daytime health and behavioral functioning in a variety of neurologic and psychiatric conditions. Sleep disorders lead to a multitude of secondary behavioral effects that affect both the individual and the family (1). Daytime sleepiness resulting from disrupted sleep often manifests itself in typically developing children as hyperactivity, inattention, and aggression (2). Those with autism, a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by difficulties in language and social communication with restricted and repetitive behaviors, may be at even higher risk for sleep disorders given the overlap of autism with sleep. In turn, behaviors inherent to autism, such as impairments in communication and stereotypies, may be exacerbated by sleepiness and interfere with the child's ability to function optimally, thereby affecting quality of life in autism. Aggression and hyperactivity, two problematic behaviors frequently associated with autism, may be further exacerbated by lack of sleep in the child with autism. This chapter will review our current understanding of the neurobiology of autism, especially in reference to sleep-related aspects of this disorder. Sleep disorders in autism, including prevalence, etiology, evaluation, and treatment, will then be characterized. The impact of sleep disorders on daytime behavior and on quality of life in individuals affected with autism and their families will then be discussed. Our chapter will conclude with future research directions for advancing our knowledge in this field.",

People suffering from impaired sleep are often unaware of the problem. Along with poor knowledge of sleep pathologies on the part of medical staff, this leads to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of sleep disorders. One of the symptoms indicating sleep abnormality is complaint of fatigue, which can represent: physical weakness, mental fatigue, or sleepiness. The latter type is associated with several sleep disorders, among which are: obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movement in sleep, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. To provide accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, medical education programs should offer the students a deeper knowledge of sleep medicine.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human behavioral and physiological processes are under the dual control of circadian rhythmicity and sleep‐wake homeostasis. In mammalian species, the underlying mechanism for the generation of most circadian rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Sleep‐wake homeostasis is an hourglass‐like mechanism relating sleep propensity and intensity to the duration of prior wakefulness. Studies under “constant routine conditions” have facilitated the detection of circadian and sleep regulation and have delineated the temporal variations over the 24‐hr day of subjective alertness (or its antonym, subjective sleepiness), cognitive performance (i.e. objective alertness), and mood, as well as endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular function. Subjective and objective alertness vary in parallel, with detectable decreases starting around the usual bedtime until a minimum is reached in the early morning hours, and then increase during the daytime hours. Decreased sleep quality and sleep loss due to voluntary behavioral alterations or to pathological conditions are associated with disturbances of a variety of neurobehavioral, physiological parameters, as well as of subjective alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. Aging is commonly associated with pronounced alterations of both the homeostatic process and the circadian pacemaker. Strategies to improve sleep quality may have beneficial effects on mental and physical well‐being.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

Violent sleep-related behaviors have been reviewed in the context of automatic behavior in general, with many well-documented cases resulting from a wide variety of disorders. Conditions associated with sleep-period-related violence fall into two major categories: neurologic and psychiatric. Psychogenic dissociative disorders may arise exclusively or predominantly from the sleep period. Recent interest in the forensic aspects of parasomnias provides sleep medicine professionals with an opportunity to educate and assist the legal profession in cases of sleep-related violence.

Despite a growing amount of evidence, the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for SIDS is still largely incomplete. We will review the most recent epidemiological, electrophysiological, genetic and pathological research on this topic. From these data, a comprehensive model for SIDS has been proposed: the death would result from the combination of three factors (a prenatal vulnerability, a critical developmental period and an exogenous postnatal stress) and three potential mechanisms (deficiencies in breathing, autonomic and sleep-wake controls). As arousal represents the last chance of survival when an infant is exposed to a life-threatening challenge during sleep, failure to arouse could be involved in the final pathway of SIDS. An infant could be vulnerable to SIDS because of a deficiency in cardio-respiratory or in sleep/wake behaviour controls during sleep. Genetic, metabolic, nutritional or toxic prenatal brainstem injury could be responsible for these deficits. The infant s vulnerability lies latent until he/she enters the critical developmental period from 2 to 6 months when significant changes in sleep-wake, breathing and autonomic controls occur. The accident has a greater probability of occurring when the infant is exposed to an infection, or an unfavourable environmental factor which enhances the immature cardio respiratory and sleep/wake behaviours of the infant.

The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

      "abstract": "Comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA) is a common condition which results in additive impairments to patients' sleep and quality of life, difficult diagnostic decisions for treating clinicians, and problems with treatment adherence and effectiveness. 1 Although the co-occurrence of insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was first reported by Guilleminaut and colleagues in 1973, 2 there was a lack of research interest in the field until two articles were published in 1999 3 and 2001, 4 reporting that 50% of patients with OSA report clinically significant insomnia symptoms, and 43% of those with insomnia fulfill minimum diagnostic criteria for OSA.][7] Despite this increased interest in COMISA, there has a been a surprising lack of research investigating the validity of current measures of insomnia in the presence of co-occurring OSA.Insomnia and OSA result in many shared symptoms that can complicate the measurement and diagnosis of each disorder in the presence of the other. 5For example, a diagnosis of insomnia is indicated according to the frequency, severity, timing, and chronicity of trouble falling asleep or night time awakenings, and associated daytime functional impairments. 8However, OSA commonly manifests in similar symptoms; including perceptions of nonrestorative sleep, frequent (postapneic) night time awakenings, and daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and depressive symptoms.Additionally, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders lists \"insomnia\" among criteria to indicate a diagnosis of OSA in the presence of an apnea-hypopnea index of 5-15 events/h. 8These shared symptoms therefore complicate the measurement and diagnosis of COMISA, and highlight the need for research investigating the validity of current insomnia measures in patients with OSA.The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) 9 is a concise and useful self-report measure of insomnia, which has been used in several hundred cross-sectional and treatment studies.However, there has previously been a lack of data examining the validity of the",

They wax and wane spontaneously over time and look like fragments of normal movements. Their frequency may increase in situations of stress or challenge and during emotional excitement. The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

A significant proportion is related to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, either diffuse or focal (e.g., stroke). Neonatal brain injury is recognized clinically by a characteristic encephalopathy that evolves over days in the newborn period. This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births. More than 95% of infants with neonatal stroke survive to adulthood, and many have some form of motor or cognitive disability.",

The pathophysiology of NE is not fully understood. It has been suggested that NE is the result of a combination of osmoregulatory or urodynamic disturbances, disorders of arousal and genetic factors. The evaluation of a child with minctional disorders begins with a good history and a physical examination. Then laboratory analysis and instrumental investigations can be used. There are pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for NE. The role of drugs is a short-term possibility that allows the child to recover confidence, or a temporary measure to tide him/her over nights spent away from home. For too long, NE has not been recognised as a severe condition, because there was no specific education at medical school and a poor involvement by the practitioners.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

Results indicate that modafinil is efficacious for sustaining/restoring objective performance and alertness during sleep deprivation with few adverse effects. At appropriate dosages, modafinil restores performance and alertness to non-sleep deprived levels. Modafinil also impairs post-sleep deprivation recovery sleep, but from the few studies available addressing this issue, it is unclear whether these sleep impairments translate into post-sleep performance impairments. Further research is needed to determine whether modafinil restores performance on simple cognitive tasks only or whether modafinil additionally restores executive functions (e.g., abstract thought, critical reasoning, planning, decision-making, situational awareness, and effective judgment) which are critical in most modern operational settings. In addition, studies are needed to determine whether modafinil use during sleep deprivation is preferable to that of other available controlled stimulants (such as dextroamphetamine) or non-controlled stimulants (such as caffeine).

      "abstract": "Insomnia is frequently associated with different medical disorders. This may be due to a variety of reasons: repercussions on sleep of the symptoms pertaining to these illnesses, e.g. pain, dyspnoea, nycturia, reduced motility, pruritus; anxiety or even depressive moods induced by the handicap, a failure to understand the course of illness, sometimes the risk to life itself; the adverse effects of certain medications used. This chapter will deal with the sleep disorders encountered in heart, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, renal, rheumatic, endocrine and metabolic conditions. For insomnias related to neurological diseases, the reader should refer to chapter 57 \"Sleep and lesions in the CNS\" and for insomnia within a framework of fibromyalgia, to chapter 60 \"Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of sleep disturbances\". As a general rule, the treatment of sleep disturbances associated with medical disorders comes under the treatment of the diseases themselves. Nevertheless it is important to take account of the associated psychological factors, such as anxiety brought on by the illness, stress provoked by a stay in hospital, the possible pain involved in explorations, a scheduled surgical operation, which quite naturally lead to proposing anxiolytic or hypnotic treatment. But there may be drawbacks to prescribing such treatment: it may have a detrimental effect on the immediate course of illness, as in the effect of benzodiazepines on respiratory failure, for example; a risk of tolerance or dependency due to the chronic nature of the underlying illness, not to mention a lack of understanding of the hypnotic effects or non-effects on the sleep of subjects affected by various types of illness.",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "‘Disorders of dreaming’ looks at the way in which the brain systems mediating dreaming can become exaggerated or distorted, with unwelcome consequences. Nightmares and night terrors are explained: night terrors are pure emotional experiences that occur on awakening from sleep and are typically associated with non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Nightmares are more likely to occur in REM sleep and, however unpleasant, are normal events suggesting that the maintenance of these emotional systems of the brain, which ensure our survival, may be one of the functions of brain activation in sleep. Sleep walking, sleep talking, tooth grinding, post-traumatic dreams, and REM sleep behaviour disorder are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It is suggested that psychotherapeutic treatment during pregnancy can help a disturbed woman achieve better integration of internal resources and self-representations, thereby preventing postnatal maternal distress. The need for psychotherapeutic intervention related to childbearing is discussed and some special features of psychotherapy with pregnant women are described, including common phase-related themes, unusual therapeutic structure, transference/counter-transference issues for both individual and group work. Key therapeutic situations are indicated by delineating three somewhat overlapping subgroups of women, who may be particularly at risk during pregnancy due to factors in their current or past experience which constitute stressors when interacting with resensitized areas of intrapsychic vulnerability. Risk-indicators specified are: Conflicted pregnancies - including unplanned, untimely and 'wrong' (such as those resulting from incest or rape). Emotional sensitization - expectant mothers who for a variety of predisposing reasons (own or maternal obstetric history, previous stillbirth or neonatal loss) or neurotic disorders, are prone to emotional difficulties such as over-or undervaluation of foetus/baby, pregnancy and/or birth. Complicated pregnancies - examining some of the possible concurrent physical conditions (maternal illness, substance abuse or eating disorders, AIDS-imperilled babies, threatened miscarriage or maternal disability), life-events (bereavement, eviction, negative test results), socioeconomic difficulties (unemployment, housing problems, poor social support), emotionally impoverished marital relationship and unsupported women on their own.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

      "title": "Is ‘Poor Sleep’ Too Vague a Concept for Rational Treatment?",
      "abstract": "Poor sleep is a common complaint, accounting for 4-5% of all general practitioner consultations. Disorders of initiating sleep are overrated by patients compared with disorders of maintaining sleep, despite the greater effect of the latter on daytime performance. There is frequently a discrepancy between subjective observations and objective measurements of sleep. General practitioners should pay attention to sleep disorders lasting more than three weeks and should bear in mind that poor sleep is a symptom, the underlying cause of which needs to be determined. Good coordination of endogenous biorhythms and external life and working circumstances can positively influence sleeping patterns. Sleep onset latency determines the amount of deep sleep and, thus, the duration and stability of core sleep. General practitioners usually prescribe a single type of benzodiazepine drug with a half-life of 5-10 h for sleep disorders. Such drugs cause the patient to fall asleep quickly, to have a considerable period of uninterrupted sleep with little waking and to wake in the morning with a subjective feeling of having slept well. A number of less desirable changes can occur, however, that may produce, for example, anxiety dreams, increased snoring and sleep apnoea periods at night, and weakness of muscles during the day. The third generation of hypnotic agents produce less undesirable changes than the second generation. Zolpidem (an imidazoypridine), one such agent, seems to provide an effective treatment for insomnia without inducing undesirable side-effects.",

Additionally 4 cases from our own experience were presented with neurophysiological and clinical aspects.Discussion on REM and NREM sleep, its phases and alternating share according to child's age was conducted. Sleep disorders were in accordance with their international classification. Parasomnias, occupying most of the space, were divided in two groups: primary and secondary. Among primary parasomnias disorders associated with falling asleep (sleep myoclonus, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rhythmic movement disorder, restless legs syndrome) are important. Another disorders are parasomians associated with light NREM sleep (bruxism, periodic limb movement disorder) and with deeper NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnabulism, night terrors), with REM sleep (nightmares, REM sleep behavior disorder) and associated with NREM and REM sleep (catathrenia, sleep enuresis, sleep talking). Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and epileptic seizures occurring during sleep also play an important role. Frontal lobe epilepsy and Panayiotopoulos syndrome should be considered in the first place in such cases. Our 4 cases document these diagnostic difficulties, requiring video/polysomnography examination 2 of them illustrate frontal lobe epilepsy and single ones myoclonic epilepsy graphy in children is a difficult technique and requires special device, local and trained personnel.

A wide variety of sleep abnormalities have been reported in the mentally retarded. Some of these sleep disturbances are common to many of the mental retardation syndromes. Other sleep disturbances are associated with specific syndromes. For example, Prader-Willi Syndrome is associatedwith excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and rapid eyemovement (REM) sleep abnormalities, both ofwhich are thought to be due to hypothalamic dysfunction.Mentally retarded childrenwith sleep difficulties aremore likely to show behavioral disturbance compared with those who sleep well (2).",

Sleep dlisorders of older adults seem to be caused by functional or organic changes in one or more of the three systems, and are roughly classified into two categories: (i) normal age-related, and (ii) pathological. The former includes decreased amplitude and advanced phase of circadian rhythms (body temperature, melatonin secretion, and sleep-waking), as well as reduced sleep duration, sleep fragmentation, and a decrease of slow-wave sleep in sleep architecture. Pathological sleep disorders include medical and psychiatric diseases (e.g., lifestyle-related diseases, dementia, delirium, and depression) and primary age-related sleep disorders (e.g., REM sleep behavior disorder and periodic limb move- ment disorders).

It can be associated with other dramatic symptoms of a psychotic nature likely to cause diagnostic uncertainty. Methods and results: These points are illustrated by the case of a young man with a severe bipolar affective disorder who independently developed terrifying visual, auditory and somatic hallucinatory episodes at sleep onset, associated with a sense of evil influence and presence. The episodes were not obviously related to his psychiatric disorder. Past diagnoses included nightmares and night terrors. Review provided no convincing evidence of various other sleep disorders nor physical conditions in which hallucinatory experiences can occur. A diagnosis of predormital isolated sleep paralysis was made and appropriate treatment recommended. Conclusions: Sleep paralysis, common in the general population, can be associated with dramatic auxiliary symptoms suggestive of a psychotic state. Less common forms are either part of the narcolepsy syndrome or (rarely) they are familial in type. Interestingly, sleep paralysis (especially breathing difficulty) features prominently in the folklore of various countries.",

Obstructive sleep apnea in children has many different clinical features, compared with adults. In children, obstructive sleep apnea is mainly caused by enlarged tonsils and adenoids. Other conditions such as obesity, craniofacial abnormality, and neuromuscular disease are also relevant predisposing factors. Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is associated with various secondary sequelae such as cognitive dysfunction, behavioral problem, attention deficit, reduced sleep-related quality of life and so on. The objective diagnostic test, standard polysomnograhy is often needed to diagnose and stratify the severity of obstructive sleep apnea, because subjective symptoms and signs related to obstructive sleep apnea are not always consistent with the severity of respiratory disturbance. Childhood obstructive sleep apnea should be diagnosed and treated, if clinically suspected, because various symptoms, signs and consequences can be improved with proper management. Adenotonsillectomy is the first-line treatment modality in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. In addition, continuous positive airway pressure, rapid maxillary expansion, weight control, topical steroids, and antileukotrienes may be considered as adjuvant treatment options.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

The mainstay of current treatment is adapting a conservative approach towards reversing the systemic effects and optimizing the mechanics of defecation through the use of laxatives and irrigation approaches. When successful, this approach improves both evacuation and incontinence symptoms, with associated improvements in quality of life and independence. Future therapies may be directed at modulating pelvic innervation through electrical stimulation. Stoma formation remains an option for patients refractory to other approaches.",

We present the case of a 32-year-old Caucasian woman with the classical features of PH. Her condition has progressed over the years and she sleeps for days on end or until aroused. She has been treated with multiple stimulants, with limited success. This case highlights the clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria and treatment modalities of this rare condition.",

Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

      "title": "1001 A Case of Unusual Nocturnal Movements Consistent with Paroxysmal Hypnogenic Dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) is a rare subset of paroxysmal dyskinesias characterized by recurring involuntary dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that occur during sleep or immediately after an arousal from sleep. These episodes often occur without loss of consciousness or trigger and lack association with epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Report of case(s) A 61-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea compliant with PAP was referred for abnormal nighttime movements for the past 9 years. The episodes were characterized by stereotyped involuntary dystonic posturing involving his upper extremities or his entire body lasting up to 15 seconds. The onset of the events occurred invariable during nighttime sleep and resulted in awakenings from sleep. He denied dream enactment as well as other symptoms suggestive of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. Sleep deprived EEG demonstrated left temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness and captured a typical event that occurred during NREM stage II sleep and had no ictal correlate. An MRI of the brain was unremarkable. During overnight polysomnogram, his current PAP settings were found to be effective, and three episodes of body stiffening consistent with his typical events were captured. These episodes were found to occur after awakening from REM sleep and lasted less than 10 seconds each. There was no EEG correlate, and REM atonia was preserved throughout. The patient was started on oxcarbazepine for the nocturnal movements, which reduced the frequency of events from 12 to 4 events per night. Oxcarbazepine was tapered and discontinued due to side effects and incomplete control of the events. Genetic testing for epilepsy syndromes is pending. Conclusion PHD is a rare syndrome of involuntary movements which begin during sleep or cause awakenings from sleep and can be misdiagnosed as a sleep disorder. It is crucial for the sleep physician to be aware of possible neurological causes of sleep-related movement disorders. Furthermore, our patient’s partial response to oxcarbazepine may further support that PHD may have an epileptic origin although not well characterized.

Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena.

Nine had fragmented sleep patterns, three had delayed sleep onset and three others had non‐specific sleep disturbance of unclear aetiology; all had failed to respond to conventional management. Nine patients had ocular or cortical visual impairment. The health, behavioural and social benefits of treatment were significant, and there were no adverse side‐effects. While the response was not always complete, the study clearly showed that melatonin has an important role in the treatment of certain types of chronic sleep disorders.

      "title": "[Sleep disorders and dementia].",
      "abstract": "A clinically relevant sleep-wake disturbance is found in up to half the patients with dementia, and the sundowning agitation is a common cause of institutionalisation of demented geriatric patients. The circadian rhythm of demented patients is levelled off with increased daytime sleep and disrupted night sleep. Particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and depression the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer's disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases. Greatly increased daytime sleepiness or striking insomnia at the very beginning of suspected dementia should thus prompt the search for other, possibly treatable causes of dementia. Neuropathological and neurophysiological studies support the hypothesis of a deteriorated hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (harbouring the biological clock) as a cause for the deranged circadian sleep-wake system in dementia. Management of sundowning behaviour includes restriction of daytime sleep, exposure to bright lights, and social interaction schedules during the day. The benzodiazepines and analogues usually not being sufficiently effectual, low doses of mild neuroleptics are often needed. Whether recent reports on efficacy of melatonin in elderly insomniacs also apply to demented patients is yet uncertain. The careful search and treatment of possible extracerebral physiologic factors causing reversible hypersomnia or insomnia is an important requisite. Polysomnographic studies are needed to recognise treatable sleep disturbance which could deteriorate or mimic dementia and sundowning. Particularly, a sleep-apnea-hypopnea syndrome must be searched for at the beginning of a suspected dementia, when successful treatment is still possible. Sleep studies should also identify periodic leg movements of sleep with restless legs and/or increased daytime sleepiness, and hyperkinetic parasomnias such as REM sleep behaviour disorder which may complicate or imitate sundowning.",

The child and adolescent presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms always needs a neuropsychiatric work-up comprising a psychiatric examination and a neurodevelopmental evaluation. Laboratory work-up of some kind is often required also as is a neuropsychological assessment. It is always difficult to draw the clinical line in deciding what is (and what is not) a ‘neuropsychiatric symptom’. Whenever there is a suspicion of a named disorder reflecting brain problems, a genetic disorder or when there are symptoms such as social withdrawal, empathy deficits, psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, confusion), pervasive attention deficits, learning problems, motor control problems, tics (motor or vocal), grossly disturbed eating behaviour, or significant weight loss in children or adolescents, a full neuropsychiatric work-up is always required. The neurodevelopmental work-up includes a detailed family history, review of the pregnancy and early developmental history, evaluation of social and academic settings and a developmental and neuromotor evaluation.",

Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

Insufficient sleep can have important effects on daytime function by increasing the need to nap, reducing cognitive ability including attention and memory, slowing response time, adversely affecting relationships with friends and family, and contributing to a general sense of being unwell. However, rather than aging per se, circadian rhythm shifts, primary sleep disorders, comorbid medical/psychiatric illnesses, and medication use cause sleep difficulties in older people, which psychosocial factors may also affect. Clinicians should ask elderly patients about satisfaction with sleep. Any sleep complaints warrant careful evaluation of contributing factors and appropriate treatment.",

Increasing evidence suggests that sleep disruption has a profound impact both on an individual and on a societal level. The etiology of sleep disorders is often multifactorial: biologicsocialand psychological factors play a role. This is especially true for insomniawhich is the most common sleep disorder in different populationsincluding patients on dialysis. Biochemical and metabolic changeslifestyle factorsdepressionanxietyand other underlying sleep disorders can all have an effect on the development and persistence of sleep disruptionleading to chronic insomnia. Insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleepor having nonrestorative sleep. It is also associated with daytime consequencessuch as sleepiness and fatigueand impaired daytime functioning. In most casesthe diagnosis of insomnia is based on the patient's historybut in some patients objective assessment of sleep pattern may be necessary. Optimally the treatment of insomnia involves the combination of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. In some cases acute insomnia resolves spontaneouslybut if left untreatedit may lead to chronic sleep problems. The treatment of chronic insomnia is often challenging. There are only a few studies specifically addressing the management of this sleep disorder in patients with chronic renal disease. Considering the polypharmacy and altered metabolism in this patient populationtreatment trials are clearly needed. This article reviews the diagnosis of sleep disorders with a focus on insomnia in patients on dialysis.",

Depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Depression should be recognized and diagnosed as early as possible in children and adolescents in order to start treatment on time. The most efficient treatment is a treatment that is not focused on depressive symptoms only, but also on functioning on daily bases in children.",

The more common disorders include insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Primary sleep disturbances are thought to be a disorder of hyperarousal. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction has also been confirmed. Secondary sleep disorders may occur as a result of the advanced disease or its treatments. It has been associated with a large number of potential causes, both physical and psychological. Chronic medication use, neurological or psychiatric disorders, and environmental factors can also contribute.

      "abstract": "A syndrome sometimes associated with sleeping late is identified in a student population. It is recognized as feelings of being worn-out, tired, lethargic, and irritable, with fuzzy thinking and difficulty in getting going. When it occurs, it tends to last for an average of 4.4 hr. This syndrome is particularly marked following sleep of 10 or more hr when the individual is not making up a sleep deficit. Under these conditions, the worn-out syndrome is more typical than feeling just great. These data suggest the testable hypothesis that optimal durations of sleep fall into a relatively narrow band and that disruptive psycho-physiological effects are sustained with both too much and too little sleep.",

      "title": "The Effects of Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders on Waking Performance",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSleep is a necessary and reversible behavioural state of perception, cognition, psyche and physical conditions.Abnormal sleep behaviours may include e.g.difficulties in falling asleep, breathing difficulties such as different kinds of apneas, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep onset-REM, leg movements, sleepwalking, sleep talking, tooth grinding and other physical activities.These anomalies involving sleep processes also include sleep itself, dream imagery or muscle weakness.Within sleep there are two separate states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eyes movement (REM).REM sleep is defined by EEG activation, muscle atony, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movement.NREM (non-REM) sleep is subdivided into four stages (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 -Rechtschaffen & Kales) or three stages (N1, N2 and N3 -AASM), which are defined by the electroencephalogram (EEG).The NREM stages are parallel to the depth of sleep continuum (lowest in stage 1 and highest in stage 4 sleep).NREM sleep and REM sleep continue to alternate through the night in cyclically.REM sleep episodes become longer across the night, stages 3 and 4 become shorter across the night.Sleep disorders have an impact on the structure and distribution of sleep.A distinction is important in diagnosis and in the choice of treatments.There are three very important sleep disorders: Insomnia, Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea Syndrome.Altogether, in Western Europe already suffer more than 10 % of the population from Sleep-Awake-Disturbances which has to be treated urgently; 800,000 from Sleep Apnea Syndromes and 25,000 from Narcolepsy (PETER et al. 1995).1. Insomnia is a sleeplessness and includes a decreased total sleep time, a poor sleep efficiency too little and a poor sleep quality caused by one or more of the following: trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep latency), waking up a lot during the night with trouble returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, and/or having unrefreshing sleep/not feeling well rested (even after sleeping 7 to 8 hours at night).Under this criterion the frequency is in the western industrial countries between 20-30 % in which about 10-15 % suffer under a very severe illness and 40 % of all depressions may be preceded by insomnia first.2. Narcolepsy is a genetic disorder and characterized by sleep onset REM sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.www.intechopen.comSleep Disorders 118 The exact prevalence of the general population is unknown.Great differences exist in its appearance frequency.So the frequency of Japan is 0.16 % and of Israel 0.0002 %.Central Europe (0.006 %) and the USA (0.06-0.1 %) are located in the middle.3. Sleep Apnea Syndromes (SAS) are common disorders, which are characterized by repeated oropharyngeal occlusions occurring during the sleep time (sleep-related breathing problems, intermittent hypoxemia) and may be associated with suppression of SWS sleep (disrupted and fragmentized sleep architecture).Due to intermittent hypoxemia and disrupted sleep architecture, SAS leads to impaired daytime functioning in various (neuro)psychological and affective domains and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, principally from adipositas, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.The prevalence of moderate SAS (AHI >15/h) is 9% in male and 4% in female, respectively.25-30 % Sleep Apnea Syndromes were described at patients with hypertension and 35-45 % with patients with on the left heart-failure.The SAS frequency increases with an advancing age and reaches their peak at the age from 50 to 70 years.80% of the patients suffer under excessive daytime sleepiness and a reduced sustained attention.Resulting from this it comes to performance losses both professional and in the ability to drive motor vehicles.Fragmentation of sleep and increased frequency of arousals occur in association with this three disorders and a number of other sleep disorders as well as with medical disorders involving physical pain or discomfort.In this chapter, the author will describe neuropsychological dysfunctions/courses and neuropsychiatric syndromes due sleep disorders which were characterized by 1. excessive daytime sleepiness 2. attention deficit, 3. memory dysfunction, 4. executive dysfunction, 5. driving difficulties, 6. motivation and emotional deficits, 7. psychiatric consequences (e.g.depression, anxiety) and 8. lack of ability to recognize the effects of behaviour.There are wide varieties of difficulties in assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and behavioural disability after sleep disorders.In our studies we used neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric methods in different patient groups in a sleep laboratory.Over the past five years we have been testing and treating more than 2000 patients with different sleep disorders and more than 5000 neurological patients.During admission to the clinic, all patients were selected according to their clinical diagnosis (ICD-10) and were examined neurologically, (neuro)psychologically, psychiatrically and medically.The test persons must not suffer from any severe psychiatric disorders.The study was carried out involving randomly selected patients with sleep disorders.

Other forms of reading retardation may be due to defects of vision, or hearing or to brain damage. Some children have specific difficulties in learning to read without any other abnormalities of intellect, though it is debatable whether dyslexia (a ‘specific syndrome wherein particular difficulty exists in learning the conventional meaning of verbal symbols, and of associating the sound with symbol in appropriate fashion’ 1 ) should be separated from other reading difficulties that may present similarly. 2 Unless treated it may persist throughout childhood and is often familial. 3 It is more common in boys than girls. It is occasionally associated with general clumsiness, but quite often with confusion in right-left differentiation in copying shapes and in spelling. Emotional disturbances, slow comprehension, lack of motivation, social deprivation and poor or interrupted schooling may also result in backwardness in reading.",

      "title": "REM sleep and emotion regulation",
      "abstract": "Despite substantial research focusing on the interaction between sleep and cognition, especially memory, the impact of sleep and sleep loss on affective and emotional regulation has comparatively attracted much less attention. This might be surprising considering that nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired mood express co-occurring abnormalities of sleep, and that many sleep disorders are accompanied by mood disturbances, thus suggesting an intimate relationship between sleep and emotion. Yet, recent studies evaluating subjective as well as objective measures of mood and affect, combined with insights from clinical observations and neuroimaging research, offer new evidence for the emerging role of sleep in regulating emotional brain function. In this chapter, we review clinical and neuroimaging data that support the existence of such complex interactions between sleep and emotion regulation. We report that (1) sleep disorders are frequently associated with affective symptoms; (2) patients with mood disorders often present with sleep disturbances; (3) sleep deprivation may transitorily alleviate depressive symptoms; (4) dream experiences may be highly emotional; (5) brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation, such as the limbic (e.g., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex) and ventromedial prefrontal regions, are strongly activated during REM sleep; (6) subjective mood assessments exhibit a circadian modulation. New data also show that some hypothalamic neuropeptides (hypocretin/orexin) play a dual role in the stabilization of sleep–wake states and on mesolimbic dopamine activity, with significant effects on neural plasticity related to emotional learning, reward processing, and addiction. Together, these seemingly disparate observations converge to indicate a physiological interplay between sleep–wake and emotional brain functions serving the modulation, the preparation, and the optimization of waking behavior.",

      "abstract": "The authors review the literature on the epidemiology, the clinical and electrophysiological symptoms of somnambulism. The disorder specified as \"nREM parasomnia with awakening disorder\" belongs to the nREM sleep (awakening) parasomnias. In most of the cases its occurence is familial with the highest prevalence at age 12 year. Above age 12 year most cases recover whereas 6% of prevalence is reported in adults. It is probable that most patients seek medical help only in severe cases associated with injuries, accidents or violence. Its etiology is unknown; in essence it is a sleep regulation disorder characterised by a dissociated state of partial awakening from nREM sleep: the motor system becomes awake while consciousness remains clouded. There are several medicines inducing somnambulism in patients otherwise free from this disorder. In somnambule patients the most important provoking factors are sleep deprivation as well as pathological states and circumstances evoking sleep loss. Somnambulism should be differentiated from complex partial epileptic seizures and REM behaviour disorder. As there is no specific treatment at the moment it is important to assure safe sleeping circumstances - ground flour, closed windows, and no fragile furniture. Clonazepam and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors prove sometimes effective, but the most effective methods in decreasing the frequency of somnambule episodes are the regular sleep-wakefulness schedule and the avoidance of sleep deprivation.",

      "title": "MASGUTOVA METHOD OF REFLEX INTEGRATION FOR CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY",
      "abstract": "Childhood Cerebral Palsy – the group of diseases concerned with motor disorders as the result of brain damage or dysfunction of certain brain centers – is usually acquired during the first years of life, at the time when the system of primary movement patterns is developing. Primary movements are genetically programmed for protection and survival, and also for the development of the conscious movement system. Developmentally their role is to support: - maturation of the nervous system (synaptogenesis, myelination, and brain plasticity) - brain function (cognitive development, emotional maturation) - sensory-motor integration. Dysfunctions of motor development and sensory-motor integration in the child with CP are a reflection of the type of neurological insult and the developmental stage of the infant/child when the neurological insult occurred. The developmental stages can be divided into prenatal (in utero); natal (during the birth process); or postnatal (after birth but during the first years of life). Each developmental stage is vulnerable to specific neurological insults. Prenatal palsy can be caused by infection, toxicity in the fetus, or compromised health in the pregnant mother. Some primary motor patterns and reflexes, such as Trunk Extension, Automatic Gait, Grasp, Swallowing and Sucking develop in utero. Prenatal brain damage will cause poor expression of these reflexes and adversely impact the next stage of development. Natal palsy is generally caused by neurological insult during birth: a consequence of premature birth, sudden deliveries, narrow pelvis of the mother, use of forceps during birth, etc. Natal trauma can negatively affect the activation of primary motor patterns and reflexes characteristic of a normal successful birth. In such cases the expression of these genetic programs will be abnormal. The primary movements and reflexes of childbirth, such as Head Righting, Perez, Tonic Labyrinthine (TLR) in extension, Bauer Crawling, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning, and Sucking may be dysfunctional. Postnatal palsy is often caused by an infection with encephalitic symptoms. Other causes include childhood cranial injury, central nervous system injury, and poor systemic health. Infant motor patterns and reflexes will be stressed by postnatal CP, and may develop dysfunctionally or pathologically. Dynamic reflexes (e.g., Grasp, Hands Pulling, Automatic Gait, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning); positional reflexes (e.g., Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [ATNR] Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [STNR], Babkin Palmomental, Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex",

Principles of good sleep hygiene are important for helping anyone to sleep well, but they are also valuable in combination with more specific treatments, depending on the cause of your insomnia. Sleeping tablets have a very limited part to play in the treatment of insomnia and can be harmful. They are no substitute for treating the underlying cause of not sleeping well. Coming off sleeping tablets can be troublesome and needs careful supervision. Sleeping aids bought over the counter are of doubtful value and can cause daytime problems. With professional supervision, psychological and behavioural treatments can be very effective. As already stressed, it is essential that the basic cause of insomnia is identified and treated, whenever possible. However, you probably do not need to see your doctor if your sleep problem has lasted for only a short time and is a normal understandable reaction to your circumstances—such as those mentioned earlier as causes of transient insomnia. Jet lag is one of the few exceptions to this rule where prescribed medication in the form of a short course of sleeping tablets (or possibly melatonin) can be justified (see Chapter 11).",

These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep).

Failure to awaken to the sensation of a full or contracting bladder suggesting a disorder of sleep arousal is central to the pathogenesis of nocturnal enuresis [1]. Urotherapy or biofeedback therapy is important for children with urge syndrome and dysfunctional voiding. Treatment with tolterodine or oxybutynin chloride might be helpful.

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

With age, there is an increase in periodic leg movements and sleep apnea; the most relevant parasomnia is the behavior disorder associated with REM sleep. There are also a series of problems, which although not specific to the elderly, have a greater impact on them because of their effect on sleep: lack of adaptation to emotional upsets, poor sleep habits, psychiatric affective disorders, organic disorders, use of drugs (psychotropic or others), nocturnal agitation and falls.

Insomnia has a close health relationship with other psychological illnesses such as mental disorders, anxiety disorders, and depression. This sleep disorder usually occurs when the body is unsatisfied with the duration or quality of sleep and has difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep patterns. Until now, this problem still occurs frequently, especially in teenagers who often do not have good sleep patterns. This can be caused by stress or mental disorders during the day or more often due to other medical or psychiatric disorders, such as depression. This research aims to determine the relationship between depression or anxiety disorders and sleep disorders (insomnia), as well as to find out whether there are other things related to depression that result in insomnia. The method used is a literature review. The criteria for articles used are those published in the last 10 years. Based on the research that has been collected, it has been found that there are factors that state that depression can affect sleep patterns. A study states that exercise can improve sleep quality and has many other health benefits as well. AbstrakGangguan tidur yang umum dikenal sebagai insomnia, merupakan salah satu masalah kesehatan masyarakat yang signifikan. Insomnia memiliki hubungan kesehatan yang erat dengan penyakit psikis lainnya seperti gangguan kejiwaan, gangguan kecemasan maupun depresi. Gangguan tidur ini biasanya terjadi saat tubuh tidak mendapatkan kepuasaan terhadap durasi atau kualitas tidur dan kesulitan dalam memulai ataupun mempertahankan pola tidur. Sampai saat ini masalah ini masih sering terjadi terutama terhadap anak remaja yang sering tidak memiliki pola tidur yang baik. Hal ini dapat disebabkan oleh tekanan atau gangguan pikiran pada siang hari atau yang lebih sering karena adanya gangguan medis atau kejiwaan lainnya, seperti gangguan depresi. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui gambaran hubungan gangguan depresi atau kecemasan dan gangguan tidur (insomnia), serta untuk mengetahui adanya hal lain yang berhubungan dengan depresi yang mengakibatkan insomnia. Metode yang digunakan ialah literature review. Adapun kriteria artikel yang digunakan adalah yang diterbitkan pada 10 tahun terakhir.

Sleep-related eating disorder, a parasomnia associated with binge eating during the sleep period, typically with minimal recollection or conscious control, is also associated with weight gain. In some instances, sleep eating episodes may be induced by arousals related to untreated OSA that occur during sleep. A 41-year old male veteran with a medical history of obesity, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol use disorder in remission, vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism and chronic pain, who was prescribed gabapentin, aripiprazole, prazosin, escitalopram, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, meloxicam, methocarbamol and nicotine supplements for these difficulties, presented with complaints of snoring, nightly sleep eating behaviors, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, non-restorative sleep and 40 pounds weight gain over 8 months. The patient’s main concern was sleep eating which had been occurring nightly, for at least two years. Behaviors were characterized by getting up, going to the kitchen and eating whatever was easily available, without preferences for certain types of foods. The patient did not have recollection for these events in the morning. Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrated severe OSA with an overall apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 108.3/hour. Titration of positive airway pressure (PAP) was tolerated well, and the patient was prescribed AutoCPAP 8–14 cmH2O. There was no sleep eating behavior or other parasomnia noted during the polysomnogram. This case highlights the possible associations between sleep eating behaviors and sleep disordered breathing. When these sleep disorders co-occur, it is often difficult to identify which disorder is causal. Longitudinal assessment is required to clarify the effects of positive airway pressure therapy on sleep eating, and whether such treatment has a direct impact on body habitus.",

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older.

At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal.

      "abstract": "The reciprocal interaction between sleep and pain has been reported by numerous studies. Patients with acute or chronic pain often complain of difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, shorter sleep duration, unrefreshing sleep, and poor sleep quality in general. According to the majority of the experimental human studies, sleep deprivation may produce hyperalgesic changes. The selective disruption of slow wave sleep has shown this effect more consistently, while results after selective REM sleep deprivation remain unclear. Patients with chronic pain have a marked alteration of sleep structure and continuity, such as frequent sleep-stage shifts, increased nocturnal awakenings, decreased slow wave sleep (SWS), decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and alpha-delta sleep. Many analgesic medications can alter sleep architecture in a manner similar to the effects of acute and chronic pain, suppressing SWS and REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "We present a case of recurrent fearful isolated sleep paralysis in a 52-year-old male of Indo-Caribbean ethnicity with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Recurrent sleep paralysis is a widely under-reported yet worrisome symptom of various sleep disorders. Although a benign condition in most cases, sleep paralysis in a minority of patients causes great distress. Some patients exhibit bedroom avoidance behavior, whereas others experience bedtime anxiety, making it difficult to fall asleep. This leads to poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, which can greatly impact a person's overall health. As in our case, this led to a vicious \"lack of sleep\" cycle where a patient who had bedtime anxiety and could not fall asleep, owing to his recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, also had poor quality sleep secondary to his OSA. This increases morbidity and has many potential consequences, which may include cardiovascular events, cognitive decline, and motor vehicular accidents. Sometimes, simply addressing the underlying medical condition cures the recurrent sleep paralysis as in this case where continuous positive airway pressure for OSA cured the recurrent sleep paralysis. One of our goals is to raise awareness of recurrent sleep paralysis so that patients can seek medical help and would not have to live with the anguish of the condition. Coming forward will also assist medical researchers in furthering their understanding of sleep paralysis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Disordered sleep affects daytime health and behavioral functioning in a variety of neurologic and psychiatric conditions, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are no exception. Treatment of sleep disorders in this population may not only improve sleep, but daytime behavior and autism symptoms as well. Furthermore, treatment of sleep problems in children with developmental disabilities and challenging daytime behavior may reduce parental stress and heighten their sense of control and ability to cope with their child's sleep. The causes of disrupted sleep in ASD are discussed in a separate chapter (chap. 24); this chapter will emphasize non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment options to promote sleep. Two points should be emphasized. First, defining the cause of the sleep disturbance is critical to appropriate intervention. For example insomnia due to poor sleep hygiene may be responsive to behavioral interventions, insomnia due to impaired circadian control of sleep may be responsive to treatment with supplemental melatonin or light, daytime sleepiness due to obstructive sleep apnea should respond to treatment with adenotonsillectomy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and nocturnal events due to epileptic seizures should be treated with antiepileptic drugs. Second, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments often go hand-in-hand in the treatment of sleep disturbances in ASD. Whenever possible, behavioral treatments, which provide the foundation for proper sleep, should precede pharmacologic treatments to minimize adverse effects and maximize benefits achieved from pharmacologic treatments (Table 1).",

      "abstract": "To describe the current state of the art about the main cognitive deficits that appear in patients affected with narcolepsy with cataplexy (NT1).The majority of the studies have found that the most impaired cognitive functions are attention (especially maintenance of attention or sustained attention), speed of information processing and executive functions (in particular, verbal fluency and resistance to the stimuli interference). These data indicate the difficulty to use the available cognitive resources of the patient. These alterations are similar to those present in other hypersomnias, although they might differ in intensity. Moreover, most of the studies emphasize a high prevalence of different depressive and anxious disorders. It has been suggested that predisposition to anxiety could be part of the characteristic phenotype of these patients. Anxiety could act either as a trigger for the disease or a consequence of the disease.Cognitive deficits in patients with NT1 appear in long lasting and/or monotonous tasks and in high cognitive demanding tasks. The presence of depressive symptomatology, together with excessive daytime sleepiness in these patients could affect their performance in neuropsychological test, and it might be related to their subjective perception of the cognitive deficits.Alteraciones neuropsicologicas en la narcolepsia con cataplejia: una revision.Objetivo. Describir el estado actual de conocimiento sobre los principales deficits cognitivos que presentan los pacientes con narcolepsia con cataplejia o narcolepsia de tipo 1. Desarrollo. La mayoria de los estudios ha encontrado que las funciones cognitivas mas afectadas son la atencion (especialmente el mantenimiento de la atencion o atencion sostenida), la velocidad de procesamiento de la informacion y las funciones ejecutivas (en particular, la fluidez verbal y la resistencia a la interferencia de estimulos). Estos datos indican una dificultad para utilizar los recursos cognitivos de los que dispone el sujeto. Estas alteraciones son similares a las presentes en otras hipersomnias, aunque difieren en la intensidad. Por otra parte, la mayoria de los estudios destaca una elevada prevalencia de diferentes trastornos depresivos y ansiosos. Se ha sugerido que la predisposicion a la ansiedad forma parte del fenotipo caracteristico de estos pacientes. La ansiedad podria actuar como un factor desencadenante de la enfermedad y ser asimismo una consecuencia de la enfermedad. Conclusiones. Los deficits cognitivos en los pacientes con narcolepsia de tipo 1 se manifiestan en tareas de larga duracion o monotonas y en tareas con alta demanda cognitiva, principalmente en tareas de atencion sostenida. La presencia de sintomatologia depresiva en estos pacientes, junto con la excesiva somnolencia diurna, parecen afectar a su rendimiento en las pruebas neuropsicologicas, y estar estrechamente relacionadas con la apreciacion subjetiva de dificultades cognitivas.",

We incidentally found an isolated, marked increase in REM sleep time (200 min, 40% of total sleep time, normative values: 18.2-20.3%) and in rapid eye movements density during REM sleep in a patient with a secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, associated with an anterior pontine demyelinating lesion on magnetic resonance imaging.

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

      "title": "Swallowing Disorders and Rehabilitation Techniques",
      "abstract": "Dysphagia may be defined as \"difficulty moving food from the mouth to the stomach\" (M. Donner, Dysphagia, 1, 1988) and encompasses impaired airway protection and problems with secretion management. There are a variety of neurological and neuromuscular conditions that can impair the oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phases of swallowing and cause dysphagia in infants and children. Neurologic conditions can be acute in onset (e.g. hemorrhagic, infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, cerebral infarctions) or chronic (e.g. cerebral palsy, genetic disorders, encephalopathy, myopathy, neuropathy). There are various conditions that will cause neurogenic dysphagia that are also progressive in nature and can worsen in adulthood (e.g. Arnold-Chiari malformation, intracranial malignancies, dystonia, metabolic disorders, degenerative cortical conditions). These various conditions can progress rapidly or may be subtle and slow in their emergence. Symptoms of dysphagia in infants and children include: failure to thrive, meal-time distress, spitting, vomiting, choking, coughing and gagging during meals, refusing food, excessive oral secretions, oral-tactile hypersensitivity, aspiration-related respiratory conditions, and gastroesophageal or pharyngeal reflux. The ability to swallow, suck and breathe are completely developed at birth. Recent ultrasound studies of the fetus indicate that suckling is present between the 18th and 24th week and that by 34 weeks in-utero a regular burst-pause pattern of swallow is present. This burst-pause pattern together with a stable airway are prerequisites for normal infant feeding. By the time a child is between 18 to 24 months of age, independent self-feeding for most foods is well established. The normal anatomical and physiological development of the infant swallow will be presented and contrasted with the adult swallow. Conditions that impair this normal pattern of swallow will be presented and their symptoms discussed as they relate to infants and children. When problems persist beyond 6 months of age \"intervention usually is required to resolve difficulties with spoon feeding, cupdrinking, chewing, self-feeding skills and suckling\" (Sheppard, 1997, p.57). Table Feeding disorders and dysphagia in infants and children can be both physiological or behavioral in nature. If the child is unable to eat successfully or displays negative and aversive behaviors during mealtimes, problems in parent-child interactions may emerge that place unusual stresses on the family. Stress may contribute to creation of persistent behavioral abnormalities and aversive meal-times reactions. Therefore it is important that swallowing intervention is initiated as early as possible to avoid the pervasive problems that may occur in children who are not eating normally. A thorough medical/behavioral history and clinical feeding evaluation must be conducted before starting treatment. This evaluation should be family-centered and include observations during feeding. Because management of these children may be complicated, multidisciplinary team evaluations should be conducted. The members of this team may include pediatricians, gastroenterologists, neurologists, speech-language pathologists, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, radiologists, otalaryngologists, pharmacists and psychologists to develop a diagnosis and plan of management. Provision of treatment of dysphagia is usually conducted by the speech-language pathologist trained in pediatric dysphagia and includes: therapeutic strategies for nonnutritive oral stimulation, airway and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) management, habilitation of feeding, drooling, nutritional and mealtime management techniques. For those children who have been intubated, management includes teaching techniques that will facilitate transitioning from nonoral to oral feeding. Successful rehabilitation of children with swallowing disorders requires knowledge of the parameters of normal and abnormal oral pharyngeal and esophageal swallowing plus skill in the integration of a variety of essential therapeutics techniques.",

      "title": "Mirtazapine in Primary Insomnia: Case report and Literature review",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or achieving restorative sleep, despite adequate opportunities. This condition often results in significant daytime impairments, including fatigue, concentration difficulties, and irritability. Insomnia can be primary or comorbid with other disorders such as anxiety or depression. Case Presentation: A 27-year-old woman presented with severe and chronic insomnia, persisting for 14 years with recent exacerbation. Her symptoms included significant difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in an average of only 3-4 hours of sleep per night and complete sleep deprivation for periods exceeding half an hour over the past 5 days. This sleep deficit led to pronounced emotional instability, physical discomfort, and reduced appetite, although suicidal ideation was absent. She had a past history of drug use for different psychiatric illnesses. She was started on mirtazipine 30mg and showed abrupt improvement in her symptoms. She was discharged afterwards. Discussion: The patient's chronic insomnia and its secondary effects necessitate a comprehensive treatment approach. Mirtazapine, an antidepressant with potent histamine receptor antagonism, has shown efficacy in improving sleep quality across diverse patient profiles. However, side effects like weight gain and sedation require careful monitoring. Combining mirtazapine with prolonged-release melatonin has demonstrated enhanced outcomes, particularly in perimenopausal women. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) remains the first-line treatment due to its efficacy and long-term benefits. Conclusion: Mirtazapine can be a valuable option in the therapeutic arsenal for primary insomnia, but ongoing research is needed to refine treatment strategies. Personalized treatment plans considering patient history and response are crucial for effectively managing primary insomnia and improving patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and napping are all highly prevalent among the elderly, reflecting changes in sleep architecture, sleep efficiency, sleep quality, and circadian sleep-wake cycles. Insomnia is sometimes associated with subjective daytime sleepiness, as well as other clinical and socioeconomic consequences. The daytime sleepiness will at times lead to napping. Although napping is viewed as a common age-related occurrence, little is known about its benefits or consequences. Factors reported to be contributors to daytime napping include sleep-maintenance difficulty and sleep fragmentation with consequent daytime sleepiness, nighttime use of long-acting sedating agents, daytime use of sedating medications, and dementia. However, a correlation between sleep disturbance and daytime napping has not been consistently observed. Whether napping is beneficial, neutral, or detrimental is an important issue, in light of conflicting findings regarding the impact of daytime napping on nighttime sleep and recent reports of an association between napping and adverse clinical outcomes, including increased mortality risk. Further research is needed to determine whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between napping and insomnia, and between napping and adverse clinical outcomes, and to explore the clinical implications of improving insomnia and reducing daytime napping. Clinical evaluations of hypnotic agents should assess efficacy for both improving insomnia symptoms (particularly sleep-maintenance difficulty, in the case of elderly patients) and reducing daytime sleepiness that would lead to inadvertent napping.",

      "title": "Night Eating Syndrome Presenting as Anorexia in an Athlete",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Night eating syndrome (NES) was first described by Stunkard in 1955 as \"morning anorexia, evening or nocturnal hyperphagia in a fully conscious state, and insomnia\" (21). Over time, the syndrome has been further characterized to distinguish it from other forms of nighttime eating. Although some debate still exists, NES encompasses a few key behaviors, including evening hyperphagia (or late night eating before initiating sleep) and eating after awakening from sleep (night eating) either in a fully or semi-conscious state (11). This is in contrast to binge eating disorder (BED), which describes episodes of consuming large quantities of food in discrete time periods without control (23), or sleep related eating disorder (SRED), which refers to involuntary nocturnal eating, often of bizarre foods or inedible items, that occurs after awakening (25). Late-night eating also can be found in other diagnoses, such as bulimia nervosa or dissociative disorders, but in these cases it is usually a part of a group of symptoms rather than the central problem. The hallmark of NES is a delay of caloric intake until the evening and night hours. Birketvedt revealed that night eaters consume 56% of their daily caloric intake between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., compared with 15% by control subjects (5). The foods consumed during episodes of evening hyperphagia and night eating tend to be carbohydrate-rich (7), with a high carbohydrate to protein ratio of 7:1. Nighttime awakenings are common among night eaters, and >50% of these episodes were associated with food intake, compared with 0% in control subjects (5). CASE PRESENTATION A 19-yr-old college softball player was referred to a sports medicine clinic by her team's strength staff and teammates for not eating during the daytime and a concern for possible anorexia nervosa. For most of the day, she reported a lack of appetite until approximately 3 p.m., when she ate her first meal. A teammate reported her to be seen pushing her food around the plate and not eating. She attempted to restrict calories during meals because of a bloated feeling in the morning. She denied binging or purging activities. She was seen 3 months earlier by another physician for a complaint of insomnia. She denied difficulty with initiating sleep, but experienced frequent nighttime awakenings, on average three to four times in one night. She had one roommate, and she denied excessive noise, poorly regulated temperature, or light disturbances. She did not discuss her nighttime eating with that physician. She also denied nightmares or night terrors. She had attempted over-the-counter sleep aids without improvement in her symptoms. She was started on zolpidem tartrate, which did not diminish the number of awakenings. Upon each awakening she would consume a snack, consisting of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as cookies or crackers, frequently more than 1000 calories over the night. Although she tried to refrain from eating, she felt unsatisfied and unable to reinitiate sleep until consuming food. Generally, she reported being conscious while eating. However, at times she only would become aware of the episodes by the food wrappers surrounding her bed the next morning. After eating she easily returned to sleep, but reawakened 1-2 h later. Her roommate reported having her personal food confiscated by the patient at night and engaging in conversations that the patient could not recall the following day. The following morning after an episode, she experienced a moderate amount of guilt related to her eating and modest weight gain of approximately 7 lb. She admitted to a mildly depressed mood and intermittent anhedonia. She reported anxiety related to increased life stressors over the past few months associated with softball, classes, and a new relationship. She denied having difficulty concentrating or a decline in academic work. However, she noticed decreased endurance and performance during softball practice and competitions, especially with morning activities during which she felt tired, bloated, and groggy. By not eating for most of the day, she often lacked enough energy to complete an entire afternoon practice. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. At the time of the visit about eating disorder concern, she was no longer taking any medication or supplements. She denied a personal or family history of eating disorders. A complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Upon examination, vital signs were normal; height was 5'6,\" and weight was 160 lb. The physical and psychiatric exams were unremarkable. Her Zung depression scale score was 24, and her night eating questionnaire score was 49. EPIDEMIOLOGY Although NES was described initially in the obesity literature, it is not limited to this demographic. The syndrome's prevalence among the general population is estimated at 1.5% (19). Up to 8.9% of obesity clinic patients meet the criteria for NES (16). However, the diagnostic patterns do not appear to be different for obese and non-obese individuals with NES (7). A recent study investigating familial aggregation showed that individuals with NES were more likely to have an affected first-degree relative than control subjects (OR = 4.9) (13). Recently, the link between psychiatric illness and NES has become of interest because of its association with stress and depression. Lundgren et al. found that 12.3% of patients in an outpatient psychiatric clinic met the diagnostic criteria for NES and that these patients had a higher rate of substance abuse and atypical antipsychotic use than patients without NES (12). DIAGNOSIS As NES is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV), variance in diagnostic criteria is widely seen in both past and present studies. In a recent evaluation of diagnostic criteria, Allison et al. report that the definition of night eating has ranged from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. to the more general \"after the evening meal,\" while the proportion of total calories consumed has varied from 25% to 50% (2). These inconsistencies create some difficulty in generalizing investigational results to the general population, as well as clearly identifying whether a patient meets criteria for the actual syndrome or is a variant of normal. In reality, many people have episodes of late-night eating, and in households that often spend evenings watching television, after-dinner snacking may be the norm. In addition, there is variation in the average dinnertime among cultures, with the average person in the United States eating between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., while the average person in Europe has dinner between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The question of whether to include NES in the DSM-V has prompted further investigation into the diagnostic tools and criteria currently used. In an attempt to assess two screening instruments, Vander Wal et al. found that use of a single simple screening question had adequate sensitivity but poor specificity to identify patients correctly with NES (24). Additionally, while the NEQ was correlated positively with increasing diagnostic detail, there was an inability to achieve both high sensitivity and specificity with varying cut points. Vander Wal concluded that the difference between eating late at night versus waking from sleep to eat might be the key to distinguishing NES as a true pathologic state. By evaluating several items from the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Allison et al. found that three items appear to be core aspects of the disorder: 1) evening hyperphagia and/or nocturnal eating, 2) initial insomnia, and 3) awakenings from sleep (4). Their analysis suggests that the presence of morning anorexia and a delayed morning meal added little additional information. The NEQ has evolved alongside research to characterize NES. Developed as a standardized screening tool for diagnosing NES, the current version is a 14-item questionnaire that addresses both behavioral and psychological aspects of the syndrome. The questions investigate the following aspects of NES: morning hunger and timing of first food consumption, cravings, control over eating before bedtime and during nighttime awakenings, percentage of post-dinner food consumption, initial insomnia, frequency of awakenings, associated food consumption during awakenings and awareness during these episodes, and mood disturbance (4). By varying the cut score, Allison et al. calculated that a positive predictive value of up to 77% can be attained (2). While the NEQ has been shown to be an efficient and valid measure of the severity of NES, its primary use is as a screening tool and it should not replace clinical interview for diagnosis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY In general, it has been recognized that the pattern of intake rather than the total calories ingested is different in NES subjects compared with controls (17). NES has been linked to changes in the circadian rhythm and disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Therefore, NES has been described as delayed circadian eating patterns superimposed upon normal sleep-wake cycles (17). An inpatient study by Allison et al. showed a decrease in overnight ghrelin levels, a stomach-derived appetite stimulant, compared with control subjects, whereas insulin and glucose increased at night (1). No difference was found in secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), melatonin, leptin, cortisol, or prolactin. In comparison, Birketvedt et al. found attenuated secretions of nocturnal leptin (an adipocyte-derived appetite suppressant) and melatonin, whereas cortisol was increased (5). In a small study comparing the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone among people with NES and control subjects, an attenuated response of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol release was observed, suggesting an overexpressed HPA (10). The authors interpret this finding to be a result of the constant stressful stimuli to which people with NES are exposed, but they note that, alternately, it may be a direct result of a fasting state. They hypothesize that the behaviors of disordered sleep and increased nighttime appetite may be related directly to the neurotransmitter alterations that are caused by an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Based upon the observed caloric intake and neuroendocrine assays in a study of 15 women with NES and 14 control subjects, Goel et al. theorized that NES might represent dissociation between a central timing mechanism in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other presumed regulator systems in the central nervous system, stomach, or liver (9). Again, the question of causality arises in interpreting whether the observed differences in ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, insulin, and glucose amplitudes and timing are altered independently compared with control subjects or are results of the abnormal behaviors of nocturnal waking and eating. TREATMENT Researchers have explored several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic options for NES, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, topiramate, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation training, and light therapy. Lundgren et al. demonstrated elevated binding of midbrain serotonin transporters, which may amplify the reuptake of serotonin and impair postsynaptic serotonin transmission (14). This theory can explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are useful in treating individuals with NES. Early studies and case reports related reduction in night eating episodes and decrease in overall caloric intake to both short-term (2 wk) (15) and long-term (6-15 months) (20) SSRI use. In an 8-wk randomized, placebo-controlled study of sertraline for NES, 12/17 in the sertraline group responded to therapy compared with 3/17 in the control group (16). Seven of the 12 responders in the sertraline group had a remission or complete resolution of symptoms, compared with one of the three responders in the control group. This study was different than previous SSRI trials because it included a small number of normal weight subjects. Of these, two of the three in the sertraline group responded, compared with zero of three in the control group. Participants in the study group had a 30% chance of responding at 2 wk and a 50% chance of responding between weeks 4 and 8. Overall, the sertraline group had a significant reduction in the symptoms of NES, including a reduction in nocturnal ingestions (80%), lower caloric intake after the evening meal (32.5%), and weight loss (approximately 1 lb·wk−1). The changes in night eating did not correlate with changes in depressive symptoms, which were modest at baseline. Because individuals with NES report greater levels of depression and anxiety in addition to displaying evidence of elevated stress (increased cortisol and CRH), Pawlow et al. designed a study to evaluate effects of relaxation training (18). The study focused upon the short-term effects on a group (N = 10) randomized to abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation technique (APRT) compared with control subjects (N = 10). Participants in the APRT group reported lower levels of anxiety and stress and higher levels of relaxation immediately after a session, which correlated to lower levels of salivary cortisol. After 7 d of home practice, the significant decrease in levels of anxiety and stress persisted in the APRT group compared with control subjects. The relaxation group also had a significant increase in morning appetite and decrease in evening appetite rating, but had a nonsignificant decrease in days with post-bedtime eating. Bright-light therapy has been suggested as a therapy for weight loss in obese subjects (6). A case report of an obese woman with NES demonstrated resolution of night eating symptoms when exposed to light therapy, in addition to decreased depression scores (8). NES symptoms recurred when light therapy was discontinued. Light therapy's ability to alter the circadian pattern changes seen in NES may explain this therapeutic observation. DISCUSSION We used the following provisional criteria outlined by Birketvedt (1999) (5) to diagnose our athlete with NES: 1) morning anorexia, even if breakfast is eaten; 2) evening hyperphagia, in which >50% of daily energy intake is consumed after the evening meal; 3) awakenings at least once per night; 4) consumption of snacks during awakenings; 5) repetition of provisional criteria longer than 3 months; and 6) does not meet the criteria for bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder. To our knowledge, there have been no studies or case reports focusing upon NES in the athletic population. However, there is a well-accepted association between sports participation and eating disorders. While determining the true prevalence in athletes has been difficult, one Norwegian study estimated that 13.5% of elite athletes have eating disorders, defined as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified, compared with 4.6% in the control population (22). Our patient was diagnosed before the Allison et al. (2009) proposed diagnostic criteria for night eating syndrome (3). Our patient fulfilled these criteria as well as the older Birketvedt criteria. With regard to NES, there are specific issues to consider in the athletic population. First, although morning anorexia may exist, athletes may force themselves to eat breakfast to meet the energy demands of early morning practice or competition. Similarly, athletes may appear to have a normal percentage of preevening meal calories, but their calorie requirements may far exceed their intake. As in our athlete, symptoms of underperformance as a result of a negative energy balance and inadequate sleep may be the driving factor to seek medical attention. Finally, although some athletes may notice weight gain, overall they are less likely to be clinically overweight or obese given the intense training required to perform at a high level. Our athlete's initial complaint was of insomnia, and she was instructed initially in basic sleep-hygiene practices. Her nighttime eating was not mentioned on the first visit, and the prescription of a sleep aid may have exacerbated her problem. Once NES was diagnosed, she was started on sertraline (50 mg daily). She was titrated gradually up to a dose of 200 mg daily over the next 6 wk. She was simultaneously sent to the college mental health center for cognitive-behavioral therapy. She went for four visits and reported a significant reduction in symptoms with the treatments. Although she awoke on average once per night, down from the previous three to four times each night, she was usually able to return to sleep almost immediately without eating. She developed regular eating patterns, consuming three regular meals per day with one to two snacks. Her mood improved and anhedonia also resolved. She continued softball participation throughout her treatment, with noticeable improvements and increased consistency in performance once her night eating resolved.",

It describes epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic options for each of the excessive somnolence disorder. Hypersomnia may be caused by an underlying medical or neurological disease. Secondary hypersomnias described in the chapter include Parkinson's disease, genetic disorders, endocrine disorders and psychiatric disorders. Multiple chemical substances, especially organic solvents with chronic exposure, may cause hypersomnia. Pancreatic, adrenal or renal insufficiency, and hepatic encephalopathy are other causes. Hypersomnia may occur as a side effect of many drugs, due either to the soporific effects of the drug or to the effect of the drug on reducing night-time sleep.",

Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnias occur from deep NREM sleep and often involve complex behaviours that may appear purposeful but are not conscious or under deliberate control. There are a number of different types/presentations of NREM parasomnias. These may range from common manifestations such as sleeptalking, sleepwalking or night terrors, to the rarer sleep-related eating disorder or sexsomnia. Clinical features can facilitate the differential diagnosis, but polysomnography may be needed, particularly to assess potential concomitant sleep disorders that might represent precipitating factors. Medical treatment is often not indicated, but clonazepam or antidepressants may be used in more severe cases.

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders and Headache",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, difficulty with falling or staying asleep, is the most common sleep complaint among patients with frequent headaches. Insomnia can be related to conditions common among headache patients, such as depression, anxiety, lack of exercise, and medications that make good sleep harder to achieve. Patients with chronic migraine, which includes headache 15 or more days per month, report having almost twice the rates of insomnia as those with less frequent headaches. Rates of sleepiness in the daytime and snoring are also more frequent in those with frequent headaches. Patients with chronic headaches are more likely to be depressed or anxious, which can further worsen sleep problems. Separating out all these issues is sometimes necessary, but also addressing all of the problems without just focusing on only one area is more likely to result in success. Clues to there being a primary sleep disorder in addition to a headache disorder include snoring, gasping during the night, falling asleep during the day, and not feeling rested upon awakening. The overwhelming need to move one's legs when trying to sleep can further disrupt sleep, and is frequently associated with restless legs syndrome. Before a doctor visit to address a possible sleep disorder, it is useful to have a sleep diary in hand. Write down the activities in the hour before bed, the time it takes to get to sleep, the number of awakenings, the total sleep time, and the impression of being rested or tired the next day for each day of the week. Include evening meal times, exercise, and activity in the 4 hours prior to falling asleep. Caffeine intake, energy drinks, weight loss supplements, and any migraine medications, especially those containing caffeine, need to be recorded. Bringing this diary to the office visit can sometimes lead to effective changes that do not involve taking another medicine, and targeted changes can enhance well-being and function throughout the day. Many find that if they can improve sleep time and quality of sleep, headaches do improve. If the sleep log seems to suggest possible sleep apnea, restless legs, or another sleep disorder that requires monitoring for a definitive diagnosis, a formal sleep evaluation will be recommended. While sleeping, the patient is monitored for irregular breathing, temporary obstruction of the airway while relaxed, levels of oxygen, or involuntary movement of the arms or legs while sleeping. Based on these findings, behavioral changes, airway devices, or medicines may be recommended. Many times, consistent behavioral changes are needed for those with headaches and sleep problems. Those with chronic headache tend to cut back on physical activity because exercise temporarily seems to worsen headaches. People with frequent headaches often spend more time resting, lying down, or sitting. This in turn results in being less tired at night. Naps during the day are common. Lack of activity and exercise can worsen depression and anxiety, further adding to difficultly falling and staying asleep. Engaging in restful and non-stress producing activities before going to sleep can set the stage for a better night's sleep. Computer activities, mobile phone devices, and stress-producing work should be avoided in the hour before sleep. The aim is to set aside enough time for 7-8 hours of sleep. This is better achieved by going to bed within an hour of the same time every night, and getting up at similar times. A not uncommon migraine problem is sleeping in on weekends after a long week of not getting quite enough sleep. Catching up on sleep often leads to a wake-up weekend headache, which is frustrating, as this is the time people want to be with their families, run errands, and have fun. This headache coming on after stress has decreased is called let-down headache, and it is unfortunately common. Also common is wake-up headache. The most common time for migraine to occur is in the early morning, and many times people will sleep through the time when a headache is beginning to emerge. By missing the best time to take migraine medicines, which is early in the headache, the medicines are less likely to be effective. Individuals who take their pain and headache medications too frequently, that is, have medication overuse headache, can experience their medications wearing off during the night, triggering a headache. Most over-the-counter and narcotic pain medications wear off in 4-8 hours, making people most vulnerable during the early morning, particularly if overusing these medications. There are unusual headache disorders closely timed to sleep hours. For instance, cluster headache is often called the alarm clock headache, as it will wake a sufferer at a similar time every night with excruciating pain. There may be a link between cluster headache and sleep apnea, with the drop of oxygen while sleeping possibly triggering an attack. Another headache disorder linked to sleep, typically occurring a few hours after falling asleep, is hypnic headache, mostly affecting the elderly. This is sometimes treated with a dose of caffeine before bed, which is sort of a paradox. For most people, frequent intake of caffeine leads to a worsening of a sleep disorder. The caffeine wears off during the night, resulting in a caffeine withdrawal headache. If caffeine is taken too close to bedtime, it can worsen insomnia with trouble falling asleep and restless awakenings. Many over-the-counter migraine medications, as well as butalbital combination tablets, contain caffeine, leading to rebound headaches, withdrawal headaches, and insomnia. If behavioral changes are insufficient, medications can be helpful. It is best to go with a medication that is not habit forming, and will not have side effects the next day. The sleep-inducing effect of some medications wears off over time, so these would not be best for long-term use (Table). In summary, headaches and sleep disorders can be closely linked. Examine your activities as you prepare for sleep, exercise habits, intake of caffeine, and other stimulants. Keep a log of your sleep patterns and your headaches, and bring it in to discuss with your provider. Note whether you snore or gasp at night. Behavioral changes are safe and can lead to better health. Medications, carefully chosen, can improve sleep if behavioral changes are not fully effective.",

      "title": "Insomnia disorder: State of the science and challenges for the future",
      "abstract": "Summary Insomnia disorder comprises symptoms during night and day that strongly affect quality of life and wellbeing. Prolonged sleep latency, difficulties to maintain sleep and early morning wakening characterize sleep complaints, whereas fatigue, reduced attention, impaired cognitive functioning, irritability, anxiety and low mood are key daytime impairments. Insomnia disorder is well acknowledged in all relevant diagnostic systems: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, 5th revision, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd version, and International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision. Insomnia disorder as a chronic condition is frequent (up to 10% of the adult population, with a preponderance of females), and signifies an important and independent risk factor for physical and, especially, mental health. Insomnia disorder diagnosis primarily rests on self‐report. Objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the routine diagnostic canon, but play an important role in research. Disease concepts of insomnia range from cognitive‐behavioural models to (epi‐) genetics and psychoneurobiological approaches. The latter is derived from knowledge about basic sleep–wake regulation and encompass theories like rapid eye movement sleep instability/restless rapid eye movement sleep. Cognitive‐behavioural models of insomnia led to the conceptualization of cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia, which is now considered as first‐line treatment for insomnia worldwide. Future research strategies will include the combination of experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and may benefit from more attention to dysfunctional overnight alleviation of distress in insomnia. With respect to therapy, cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia merits widespread implementation, and digital cognitive‐behavioural therapy may assist delivery along treatment guidelines. However, given the still considerable proportion of patients responding insufficiently to cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia, fundamental studies are highly necessary to better understand the brain and behavioural mechanisms underlying insomnia. Mediators and moderators of treatment response/non‐response and the associated development of tailored and novel interventions also require investigation. Recent studies suggest that treatment of insomnia may prove to add significantly as a preventive strategy to combat the global burden of mental disorders.",

      "title": "Functional (Psychogenic) Cognitive Disorders: A Perspective from the Neurology Clinic",
      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "abstract": "Every illness represents in some way a threat and increases the sense of vulnerability. The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "title": "Two Cases of Narcolepsy Patient Portraying a Tendency of a Dull Learning Ability and Mistaken as an Idle Student",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sleepiness is associated with many different conditions and, as a neglected topic, it can be the cause of serious psychologica l and social disadvantages. In the aspect of learning, additional pro blems may arise from poor progress in school caused by the effe ct of sleepiness on concentration, memory, and other cognitive functi ons. Narcolepsy is by no means the most common cause of excessive sleepiness. Nonetheless, it is not a rarity, especial ly in young people. The non-specific nature of early features o f narcolepsy, combined with very limited awareness that the condition can start in various ways, leads to many misinterpretations. Misinterpretation of narcolepsy symptoms is not confined to the medical profession. Teachers may well be critical of a student with narcolepsy because of their perception of narcolepsy symptoms a s laziness, poor motivation, or difficult behavior and dull lea rning ability. Inappropriate reactions by parents, teachers, and peer s, based on misinterpretation of narcolepsy symptoms or the pat ient’s reactions to them, make a difficult situation worse. Especially in Korea, where schooling is focused on college entrance exami-nations, the problem is very serious and intensified by inappro priate or delayed diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, psychiatr ists should be aware that narcolepsy in young adolescents is not rar e and that they need to be familiar with its clinical features in both its classic and less obvious forms. Narcolepsy should be suspec ted if a adolescent’s excessive sleepiness can not be explained in other ways. Therefore, we report on two patients who portray the tendency o f dull learning ability and are mistaken as idle students. We diagnosed narcolepsy through polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing. We treated the students with methylphenidate and pemolin. The students showed improvement in learning a bility and were able to adapt better to school.",

      "title": "Insomnia in peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women and in some somatic diseases",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

      "abstract": "Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed on the basis of motor symptoms, including slowness of movement, tremor, rigidity and difficulties with balance and walking, now we are aware that non-motor symptoms are highly prevalent, since they can anticipate motor symptoms and can cause severe consequences. Several studies have shown that non-motor symptoms, such as depression, anxiety and apathy, psychosis (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), sleep disturbance, and pain may have a greater adverse impact on quality of life and health economics compared with motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms can be divided into four domains: neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression, anxiety, apathy, hallucinations, dementia), autonomic (e.g., constipation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary changes, sweating abnormalities), sleep (e.g., insomnia, sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement, sleep behavioural disorder, restless leg syndrome), and sensory dysfunction (e.g., pain, olfactory dysfunction). This review addresses diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. The causative mechanisms remain complex, since they reflect the widespread brainstem and cortical pathology of PD, with involvement of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. The diagnosis is often challenging, especially for psychiatric disorders, and in particular affective disorders, because somatic features of psychopathology may overlap with the movement disorder itself. Treatments used are limited and psychiatric drugs may not be as effective as in general population. Evidence based medicine is quite poor and it still requires well-designed clinical studies.",

      "abstract": "A review of the sleep of 31 patients 45 years old or older undergoing nocturnal penile tumescence studies showed that 19 had a previously undiagnosed sleep disorder. Of the patients 9 had periodic leg movements in sleep, 9 had sleep apnea and 1 had both disorders. In 10 of these patients the sleep disorders affected nocturnal penile tumescence by disrupting sleep and causing brief periods of detumescence, movement artifacts and delays in the tumescing phase of nocturnal penile tumescence. These disruptions resulted in an apparently abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence that appeared as if the patient had difficulty in achieving or maintaining an erection. The nocturnal penile tumescence disruptions may have reflected only a disruption of the necessary conditions for normal nocturnal penile tumescence to occur, namely adequate sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. The results strongly suggest that failure to measure concurrent sleep parameters and screen for occult sleep disorders could result in the incorrect diagnosis of abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Circadian rhythm (CR) dysfunction is a prominent feature in bipolar disorder (BD) and sleep disturbances are characteristic, although not essential to the diagnosis. Objectives To review the literature regarding the CR dysfunction and its impact on the onset and clinical course of BD. Methods We conducted a MEDLINE search using bipolar disorder, circadian rhythm and sleep as keywords, selecting studies written in English. Results CR dysfunction is a trait marker of BD. It’s known that during depressive episodes insomnia is present, with difficulty falling asleep/ maintaining sleep and early awakening. Regarding mania, decreased need for sleep is a critical marker. During the euthymic period significant alterations in sleep pattern have been described. It’s also known that changes in the sleep pattern occur prior to those in mood patterns, indicating that sleep dysregulation may trigger the onset of mood episodes or relapses. Therefore, CR disruption may be associated with the pathophysiology of BD and some factors have already been identified: irregularity of the sleep-wake rhythm, eveningness chronotype, abnormality of melatonin secretion, vulnerability of clock genes and the irregularity of social zeitgeber. Conclusions Disturbances of sleep are pervasive, and an essential feature of BD, worse during mood episodes, but still present during euthymic periods. It remains to determine whether circadian rhythm dysfunction is a trait marker or mood state dependent. Further studies are warranted to clarify this association.

      "abstract": "El insomnio es una de los principales desordenes del sueño más prevalentes, este se define como la dificultad para conciliar el sueño (insomnio inicial), permanecer dormido durante la noche o despertarse muy temprano en la mañana antes de lo planeado (insomnio terminal). Según el tiempo de evolución se puede clasificar en agudo si dura menos de 4 semanas, subagudo entre 4 semanas pero menos de 3 a 6 meses y crónico mayor a 3 a 6 meses. Esta afección es causada por diferentes etiologías donde están el insomnio primario, el estrés, ansiedad, depresión, alteraciones del ritmo cardiaco. Actualmente se indican diferentes medicamentos para el manejo a corto plazo del insomnio, ya que su uso a largo plazo está asociado a toda una serie de efectos secundarios principalmente a nivel del sistema nervioso central, riesgo de farmacodependencia e inclusive riesgo de suicidio. Esta situación abre la oportunidad a la búsqueda de otras opciones terapéuticas más seguras y efectivas en especial de origen natural como la fitoterapia. Hoy en día existen publicados más de 134 estudios en Pubmed, relacionados con desordenes en la iniciación y mantenimiento del sueño (insomnio) y la fitoterapia, con 6 meta-análisis publicados en donde se resaltan plantas con gran soporte científico como la valeriana officinalis. Para la estratificación del grado de alteración del sueño, se cuentan con múltiples escalas validadas las cuales van desde la medición de estados alterados de la conducta hasta trastornos en la personalidad, escalas que miden la calidad de vida en pacientes con cáncer, así como las que miden estados afectivos. Durante estos 6 años de práctica clínica como médico especialista en medicina alternativa, he venido formulando una preparación Fito terapéutica magistral Tranquilizante, fabricada por el laboratorio LABFARVE, que está compuesta de una relación 1/1 de parte aérea de Justicia polygonoides, hojas de Passiflora mollisima, las hojas de Scutellaria coccinea y rizomas, raíces y tallos de Valeriana pavonni, a partes iguales en etanol al 36% (Ver ficha técnica extracto), cuya indicación esta para alteraciones o desordenes del sueño como el insomnio , en especial asociado a alteraciones emocionales como el estrés, ansiedad y depresión. Su dosificación para el caso de los adultos son 40 gotas en un vaso de agua vía oral 30 minutos antes de ir a la cama. La respuesta terapéutica a la fecha en mi percepción ha sido muy buena y es aquí donde considere la oportunidad de evaluar esta percepción de una manera más objetiva por medio de una serie de casos clínicos, usando como instrumento de medición una auto encuesta por parte del paciente debidamente validada, para medir la respuesta de la fórmula magistral antes y después de su prescripción.",

      "abstract": "Two situations, which may of course interfere, are described in the field of psychological and psychiatric emergencies in child and adolescent: 1) therapeutic emergencies, true emergencies, linked to acute mental suffering or even distress in the child which it is important to relieve quickly. They are not always the object of an acute request for medical care, and when such a request is made, it is rarely based on what the child feels, but much more on noisy or troublesome behaviour or somatic manifestations of the latter, this last possibility producing a masked psychiatric emergency very characteristic of this age; 2) environmental emergencies represent a second form of emergency, defined by a situation which appears when the child's family or tutors suddenly decide that they can no longer face such a behaviour or such symptoms in the child. Intolerance then appears, or even rejection of the child from his home. The authors were led to determine this double dimension, concentrating their attention on the first few years of life, childhood from 4 to 5 years to 11 or 12 years and adolescence. Insisting on the dual necessity, even in emergency cases, of sufficient reflexion and necessary concentration of interest on problems as they are presented by the family, the authors describe the various stages of an emergency: entering into contact, evaluation of the situation, choice of the emergency procedure: gaining time or admission to hospital in a specialized unit. They end by taking into consideration the fact that one is never sufficiently attentive to the child himself and to his own way of dealing with the situation.",

Meta-analysis was performed when two or more studies of the same substance could be analyzed in a subpopulation of participants (i.e., with the same illness).\r\nRelevance to Nursing\r\nFatigue is the most commonly reported symptom in individuals who have cancer and also is highly prevalent in populations with progressive life-threatening conditions. Fatigue presents a challenge for healthcare professionals because it can be nonspecific to treatment or illness, ongoing, subjective, and disabling to patients. In addition, the actual causes of fatigue are difficult to isolate, particularly in the person who is receiving palliative care because the symptom usually overlaps with concurrent disease-related problems such as malnutrition, sleep disturbances, pain, depression, asthenia, infections, and anemia. No consensus exists on the definition of fatigue or a standardized method of assessment. The working diagnosis used for the purpose of this review was “fatigue is a subjective feeling of tiredness, weakness or lack of energy” (Radbruch et al., 2008, p. 15).\r\nIn the context of palliative and advanced disease, fatigue can be viewed as an inevitable characteristic of the last phase of life. However, several pharmacologic treatments have been studied in an attempt to reduce the severity of the symptom and thereby improve the overall quality of life. Knowledge of effective medical treatments will be of particular interest to nurses who care for patients who frequently experience debilitating fatigue.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

We report the first case of CWS, in whom neuropsychological functions, extension of the underlying lesion, and sleep architecture changes were assessed. A 73‐year‐old woman reported a total dream loss after acute, bilateral occipital artery infarction (including the right inferior lingual gyrus), which lasted for over 3 months. In the absence of sleep–wake complaints and (other) neuropsychological deficits, polysomnography demonstrated an essentially normal sleep architecture with preservation of REM sleep. Dreaming was denied also after repeated awakenings from REM sleep. This observation suggests that CWS (1) can represent a distinct and isolated neuropsychological manifestation of deep occipital lobe damage, and (2) may occur in the absence of detectable REM sleep abnormalities.

      "abstract": "Fear of the dark is a common complaint of pre-teenage children. 1 2 It should not be confused with night terrors or panics, in which a child becomes acutely agitated and terror-struck at night, appearing to be awake while in fact asleep and unable to be woken. 3 4 In contrast, fear of the dark can be experienced by the conscious child in dimly lit or dark conditions.When such fear is excessive it is often attributed to attention seeking behaviour or assumed to be an irrational fear that will abate with time.Most people can see a little in very dim lighting conditions after a short period of adaptation.However, a child with no visual problem obvious to the parents and who can see normally in well lit conditions can present as being unable to see at all in the dark even after a period for adaptation.In a child who cannot yet talk this may simply appear as fear of the dark.We describe two patients with congenital stationary night blindness, a diagnosis which may be missed without appropriate history taking from the parents, particularly if there is no family history of visual problems.",

      "title": "Micturition reflex epilepsy with tonic seizures – A rare semiology with insights from magnetoencephalography",
      "abstract": "Reflex epilepsy is a condition, wherein epileptic seizures are triggered by specific stimuli such as flashing lights, music, reading etc. Stimuli may be exogenous (sensory) or endogenous (e.g.: praxis induced, solving calculations). Very rarely, the act of urination can set off seizures and this may often be confused with micturition syncope, when loss of consciousness occurs early. Our patient is a 5-year-old boy who was born to non-consanguineous parents by normal delivery. He had a smooth perinatal transit and an unremarkable first year of life. He had delay in acquisition of language milestones and began to speak bi-syllables by 2.5 years of life. Development in other domains was relatively normal. At the age of 4 years, he was noticed to have brief episodes of posturing of his upper limbs with up-rolling of eyes during sleep. These events lasted for a few seconds and occurred 5–6 times during the night. The child was treated with sodium valproate (SVA) and levetiracetam (LEV) at weight appropriate doses elsewhere. Despite good compliance, he continued to suffer from daily nocturnal brief tonic seizures. About 4 months into the illness, he developed another symptom. When the child commences to urinate, he loses consciousness and slumps to the floor. His mother reported that his limbs appeared to be tightly held in extension and his eyes looked to the right. This phenomenon occurred when child urinated in both sitting and standing position. The possibilities considered were micturition induced reflex seizures vs. micturition syncope. In view of pre-existing developmental delay and co-existing nocturnal seizures, the former differential diagnosis appeared to be more likely. His scalp EEG showed a posterior dominant rhythm of 4−5 Hz. He had frequent spikes in the right temporal (F8, T4) and frontocentral (FC) regions (F4,C4) and rare spikes in the left FC leads (F3,C3). To precisely characterize the nature of his symptoms, he underwent video-EEG telemetry. A total of 6 stereotyped events were recorded, all during micturition. Within a few seconds of starting to urinate, the child had slow neck flexion, looked to the right side with eye version to the right and had posturing of his upper limbs (right in extension and left in flexion). Its counterpart ictal EEG showed low amplitude fast activity in the midline centroparietal leads which increased in amplitude and culminated into bilateral centroparietal slowing towards the end of the attack. He regained consciousness 10 s after the cessation of ictal activity (Fig. 2). EKG recording during the ictus did not show any alteration in rhythm. It is likely that these seizures were originating from near the midline, possibly from the left hemisphere. Given that the micturition centers are also in the mesial frontal regions, this finding is not surprising. MRI done with a 3 T scanner was normal and PET-MRI did not show any areas of focal hypometabolism (Fig. 1a, ). Interictal MEG showed equivalent current dipoles clustered in the left midline posterior parietal region just above the corpus callosum (Fig. 1b). Though this is an interictal finding, it appears to be concordant with the hypothesis generated from VEEG. LEV was tapered and was prescribed lamotrigine (3 mg/kg) along with SVA (25 mg/kg). There was complete cessation of both reflex and non-reflex nocturnal seizures for the past 9 months.Fig. 2Clinical semiology and ictal EEG.Show full captiona. Clinical semiology b.

Micturition is a complex physiological process which is controlled by the spinal cord, brainstem and the cortex. The higher centers for micturition lie in the pons, periaqueductal grey, mesial frontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortex. Though the exact mechanism of reflex seizures during urination has not been elucidated, one might intuitively assume that mesial frontal activation could set off seizures in susceptible individuals. An ictal EEG and ictal PET study from Japan [[1]Okumura A. Kondo Y. Tsuji T. Ikuta T. Negoro T. Kato K. et al.Micturition induced seizures: ictal EEG and subtraction ictal SPECT findings.Epilepsy Res. 2007; 73: 119-121https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2006.09.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar] observed changes in the mesial frontal region in the ictal PET scan. Clinical semiology was also suggestive of ictal onset from the left supplementary motor area. Only a handful of cases have been reported in literature, whose clinical features have been reviewed [[2]Jang H.-J. Kwon M.J. Cho K.-O. Central Regulation of Micturition and Its Association With Epilepsy.Int Neurourol J. 2018; 22: 2-8https://doi.org/10.5213/inj.1836040.020Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar]. Interestingly most patients have co-existing neuro-developmental issues. Seizure onset though commonly is seen in the midline in EEGs, case reports have mentioned other areas of EEG changes namely frontotemporal and occipital regions. Semiology and ictal EEG similar to our patient has been reported from another center in southern India [[3]Rathore C. Teaching Video NeuroImage: Electroclinical characteristics of micturition-induced reflex epilepsy.Neurology. 2008; 70: 20https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000312283.88683.0dCrossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar]. In another study, urodynamic testing during the ictus identified detrusor over activity [[4]Seth J.H. McLaughlin C. Eriksson S. Fowler C.J. Walker M.C. Panicker J.N. Blackouts in the toilet: a case of micturition-induced reflex epilepsy.Pract Neurol. 2014; 14: 261-263https://doi.org/10.1136/practneurol-2013-000733Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. To the best of our knowledge, no MEG data in this type of reflex epilepsy is currently available in literature. The MEG cluster has localized to the midline left parietal region, which is posterior to the 'known micturition center' in the frontal region. The interictal MEG corresponds fairly to the region ictal EEG onset. It may only be hypothesized that this region is closely networked with the frontal micturition center. This case highlights an unusual semiology of asymmetric tonic seizures during micturition in a child with mild developmental delay and normal imaging. Overall, VEEG and MEG has suggested the role of midline structures possibly in the left parietal region. The importance of video-telemetry is emphasized, as it can help differentiate between epileptic seizures vs non-epileptic conditions. Lamotrigine and valproate combination resulted in sustained seizure freedom for 9 months. Further studies are required to elucidate treatment algorithms for these patients, but may be cumbersome as this condition is exceedingly rare.",

Perhaps the result of chronic use, a significant deterioration in sleep is apparent over the first 3 weeks of abstinence, with no indication of recovery. Interestingly, the diminished sleep is not accompanied by subjective reports of poor or worsening sleep. Rather, subjective reports actually improve over abstinence, while sleep-related cognitive performance declines. A mechanistic understanding of the apparent difference in objective and subjective measures is currently lacking. Here we review the relevant literature on cocaine use and sleep, and discuss the possible relevance of this sleep disturbance in relationship to the underlying disorder and its treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "title": "Nightmares",
      "abstract": "Nightmares are reported to occur 2–8% in the general population (American Academy of Sleep Medicine. International classification of sleep disorders, 3rd ed. Darien, IL: American Academy of Sleep Medicine; 2014). While they may be dismissed as \"bad dreams,\" nightmares may be indicative of another disorder occurring in sleep. Nightmares are part of a category of sleep disorders referred to as parasomnias—\"undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousal from sleep\" (American Academy of Sleep Medicine. International classification of sleep disorders, 3rd ed. Darien, IL: American Academy of Sleep Medicine; 2014). Parasomnias are categorized by the stage of sleep in which they occur: NREM sleep—typically observed in the first half of the night, versus REM sleep—associated with the latter half of the sleep period. NREM parasomnias are also referred to as \"disorders of arousal\" and include sleep terrors, sleepwalking, and confusional arousals. REM sleep parasomnias include REM behavior disorder (RBD) and nightmares (dreams with negative content that may cause awakening). It is important to identify what kind of parasomnia the \"nightmare\" represents, as there may be serious consequences such as injury to ones' self or others that can occur. Additionally, as in the case of RBD, it may be a potential sign of another neurodegenerative process, such as parkinsonism. Polysomnogram is often utilized in the evaluation of parasomnias and can also be helpful to exclude other disorders, which may mimic these conditions.",

      "title": "Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",
      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

They are associated with a decline in overall health status and perception of poor health and can have negative personal and social consequences. The term insomnia is defined in different ways and can describe a symptom and/or a disorder. It involves dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality and is associated with one or more of the following subjective complaints like difficulty with sleep initiation, difficulty maintaining sleep, or early morning waking with inability to return to sleep. In DSM- V ‘Insomnia Disorder’ is described under the heading of ‘Sleep-Wake Disorders’. It classifies insomnia under an umbrella term “insomnia disorders” where both primary and secondary insomnia are combined.

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

      "title": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep–Wake Disorders I",
      "abstract": "Abstract Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is debilitating and the most common circadian rhythm disorder. It is defined as having a sleep pattern delayed by at least 2–3 hours from conventional timing, with great difficulty sleeping at conventional sleep times despite the frequent desire to do so. It is assumed to be caused by a delay of the endogenous circadian rhythm. Although it has its own diagnostic criteria, it lies on a continuum spanning from intermediate to moderate and extreme evening chronotypes to DSWPD and to non-24-hour phase disorder. This continuum is mainly driven by endogenous circadian period length varying from just over 24 hours to an extreme of 25 hours. Behavioral, psychological, and societal variables also contribute to the difficulty adhering to conventional sleep times. The recent novel findings of many DSWPD patients who do not have a substantial circadian rhythm delay suggest the contribution of non-circadian factors to the intransigence of a late timed sleep period; there is considerable evidence of the association of mental and physical health risks with the apparent inability to synchronize with the earth’s 24-hour period of rotation. Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder is defined as having a sleep pattern timed earlier than desired or conventional. Attempts to delay bedtime to a more conventional time are difficult and result in reduced total sleep time since wake times remain early. This condition is relatively rare, affecting 0.0%–0.33% of the population, and infrequently presents for treatment.",

In the first part of this review, the relationship between sleep and anxiety is discussed in terms of adaptive response to stress. Recent studies suggested that the corticotropin-releasing hormone system and the locus ceruleus-autonomic nervous system may play major roles in the arousal response to stress. It has been suggested that these systems may be particularly vulnerable to prolonged or repeated stress, further leading to a dysfunctional arousal state and pathological anxiety states, Polysomnographic studies documented limited alteration of sleep in anxiety disorders. There is some indication for alteration in sleep maintenance in generalized anxiety disorder and for both sleep initiation and maintenance in panic disorder; no clear picture emerges for obsessive-compulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder. Finally, an unequivocal sleep architecture profile that could specifically relate to a particular anxiety disorder could not be evidenced; in contrast, conflicting results are often found for the same disorder. Discrepancies between studies could have been related to illness severity, diagnostic comorbidity, and duration of illness. A brief treatment approach for each anxiety disorder is also suggested with a special focus on sleep.",

Narcolepsy is about as prevalent as multiple sclerosis, and can be as disabling in its consequences, yet it is underrecognized and underdiagnosed. Because (narcoleptic) undesired sleep episodes can occur at any time, they have severe detrimental effects on daily functions, safety, and work. Patients may fall asleep involuntarily while at work or school, during social activities, or while driving or operating hazardous machinery.

Notably, animal studies show disruptions of the circadian molecular system in different models of epilepsy, along with altered rest-activity and other circadian rhythms. So far, studies of molecular circadian systems in people with epilepsy are lacking, prompting further research. Seizures-the primary and most debilitating symptom of epilepsy-and interictal activity disrupt regular sleep and sleep-wake rhythms. Alterations in one's sleep structure are seen in both drug-naïve and drug-resistant patients with epilepsy. In particular, low sleep efficiency, a reduction in total sleep time, and changes in sleep stages were found in both homogenous and mixed samples of epilepsy patients. Both ictal and interictal activity were also shown to be associated with changes in peripheral circadian phase biomarkers such as melatonin and cortisol. Moreover, epilepsy comorbidities, antiseizure medications, and a variety of syndromes can be a cause of sleep problems or even sleep disorders. Sleep disorders vary depending on various comorbidities and syndromes, and encompass all major groups of sleep disorders defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Controversial findings on the effects of various antiseizure medications were found in the literature. However, medications such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and barbiturates are particularly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Overall, a sleep evaluation must be included in the management of every patient with epilepsy.",

      "title": "Alterations of Circadian Rhythmicity and Sleep in Aging: Endocrine Consequences",
      "abstract": "All 24-hour endocrine rhythms partially reflect the interaction of circadian rhythmicity with sleep-wake homeostasis but their relative contributions vary from one system to another. In older adults, many 24-hour rhythms are dampened and/or advanced, including those of cortisol and GH. Amplitude reduction and phase advance of 24-hour rhythms may represent age-related changes in the central nervous systems underlying circadian rhythmicity and sleep-wake homeostasis. Age-related alterations in circadian function could also reflect decreased exposure and/or responsivity to the synchronizing effects of both photic (e.g. light exposure) and nonphotic (e.g. social cues) inputs. There are pronounced age-related alterations in sleep quality in aging which consist primarily of a marked reduction of slow-wave sleep, a reduction in REM stages and a marked increase in the number and duration of awakenings interrupting sleep. Alterations in slow-wave sleep occur abruptly in young adulthood (30–40 years of age) whereas disturbances in amounts of REM and wake appear more gradually. This article reviews evidence indicating that deficits in characteristics of sleep-wake homeostasis and circadian function may mediate age-related alterations in somatotropic and corticotropic function. Because sleep loss in young subjects results in endocrine disturbances which mimic those observed in aging, it is conceivable that the decrease in sleep quality which characterizes aging may contribute to age-related alterations in hormonal function and their metabolic consequences.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "title": "The Morbidity of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders and related diseases are becoming increasingly relevant for the health and wellbeing of the general and working populations. Sleep disorders affect all aspects of health, showing a bi-directionality with health conditions and comorbidity with several diseases. Consequently, sleep disorders may have severe negative consequences both for the individual and the enterprise, as well as for society on the whole, in terms of health, productivity and social costs. When considering the disturbances of the sleep/wake cycle, it is important to distinguish between those connected with endogenous biological factors from those related to socio-environmental conditions, including work, and those associated with mental and physical diseases, that are often associated and interact with each other. Many sleep disorders are still underestimated and under-valued in clinical practice and, to a much greater extent, in workers' health surveillance. The present paper is aimed at drawing the attention of the occupational health physician to some key issues, particularly regarding excessive daytime sleepiness, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and shift and night work, as well as their implications in terms of health and occupational consequences. Information on the main aspects of clinical diagnosis and health surveillance, as well as risk management and prevention at the workplace, are provided.",

      "abstract": "Daniella Meytin1 1Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Academy of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Abstract Bulimia nervosa is one of the most common eating disorders. The disease manifests in episodes of binge eating, accompanied by attempts to get rid of the food eaten by vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals, along with excessive concerns, regarding weight and appearance. The disease is more common in the Western culture, among women, especially among younger aged (usually beginning in late adolescence). The onset of the disease is influenced by biological and environmental factors. Due to laxative use, hypokalemia and arrhythmias may develop; due to vomiting – enamel damage and voice changes. Bulimia nervosa is diagnosed, if, during the last 3 months, the patient had at least 1 episode of binge eating per week, accompanied by compensatory actions (vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals). Treatment is started with psychotherapy, if it does not help or the patient is additionally diagnosed with depression, SSRI or SNRI treatment is added. 80% of treated patients achieve remission of the disease. Aim: to determine the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. Methods: a systematic review of the literature was performed using the PubMed medical database. Selected articles examining the etiology, epidemiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. English word combinations were used for search: bulimia nervosa, eating disorder, bulimia, bulimia diagnostics, bulimia treatment. Conclusions: after systematic literature review was conducted, the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa were presented.

      "abstract": "Sleep problems with behavioral origins occur in 20 to 30 percent of children and are especially common in children with medical, neurodevelopmental, or psychiatric disorders. Insomnia related to learned sleep onset associations is most common in infants and toddlers and is characterized by prolonged night waking, requiring parental intervention to restore sleep. It occurs when the child learns to associate falling asleep with specific experiences, such as being rocked or fed. Insomnia related to inadequate limit-setting is a disorder most common in children who are preschool-aged and older and is characterized by active resistance, verbal protests, and repeated demands at bedtime. Guidance to parents about healthy sleep practices helps to prevent sleep problems and is also an important first step in treatment. An integral part of the bedtime routine is the institution of a bedtime and sleep schedule that ensures a developmentally appropriate amount of sleep. A consistent nightly bedtime will help to set the circadian clock and enable the child to fall asleep more easily. Treatment of primary insomnia in older children and adolescents usually involves behavioral interventions that resemble those used in adults. Establishing a consistent sleep schedule is also important for older children and adolescents for whom poor sleep hygiene is a common cause of sleep problems. Pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of childhood insomnia is not a first-line treatment and should always be combined with behavioral therapy.",

      "title": "Sleep Bruxism in Children: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": ": Sleep bruxism, characterized by involuntary grinding or clenching of the teeth and/or by bracing or thrusting of the mandible during sleep, is common in children. Sleep bruxism occurs while the patient is asleep. As such, diagnosis can be difficult as the affected child is usually unaware of the tooth grinding sounds. : This article aims to familiarize physicians with the diagnosis and management of sleep bruxism in children. : A search was conducted in May 2023 in PubMed Clinical Queries using the key terms “Bruxism” OR “Teeth grinding” AND “sleep”. The search strategy included all observational studies, clinical trials, and reviews published within the past 10 years. Only papers published in the English literature were included in this review. : According to the International classification of sleep disorders, the minimum criteria for the diagnosis of sleep bruxism are (1) the presence of frequent or regular (at least three nights per week for at least three months) tooth grinding sounds during sleep and (2) at least one or more of the following (a) abnormal tooth wear; (b) transient morning jaw muscle fatigue or pain; (c) temporary headache; or (d) jaw locking on awaking. According to the International Consensus on the assessment of bruxism, “possible” sleep bruxism can be diagnosed based on self-report or report from family members of tooth-grinding sounds during sleep; “probable” sleep bruxism based on self-report or report from family members of tooth-grinding sounds during sleep plus clinical findings suggestive of bruxism (e.g., abnormal tooth wear, hypertrophy and/or tenderness of masseter muscles, or tongue/lip indentation); and “definite” sleep bruxism based on the history and clinical findings and confirmation by polysomnography, preferably combined with video and audio recording. Although polysomnography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep bruxism, because of the high cost, lengthy time involvement, and the need for high levels of technical competence, polysomnography is not available for use in most clinical settings. On the other hand, since sleep bruxism occurs while the patient is asleep, diagnosis can be difficult as the affected child is usually unaware of the tooth grinding sounds. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of sleep bruxism is often based on the history (e.g., reports of grinding noises during sleep) and clinical findings (e.g., tooth wear, hypertrophy and/or tenderness of masseter muscles). : In childhood, sleep-bruxism is typically self-limited and does not require specific treatment. Causative or triggering factors should be eliminated if possible. The importance of sleep hygiene cannot be over-emphasized. Bedtime should be relaxed and enjoyable. Mental stimulation and physical activity should be limited before going to bed. For adults with frequent and severe sleep bruxism who do not respond to the above measures, oral devices can be considered to protect teeth from further damage during bruxism episodes. As the orofacial structures are still developing in the pediatric age group, the benefits and risks of using oral devices should be taken into consideration. Pharmacotherapy is not a favorable option and is rarely used in children. Current evidence on the effective interventions for the management of sleep bruxism in children is inconclusive. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for specific treatment at this time.",

Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause.

Although sub-clinical sleep disturbances (insufficient sleep duration or inadequate sleep quality) may be difficult to assess with conceptual and/or methodological clarity, this review attempts to summarize and synthesize these findings. First, the concept of sleep disturbance in a public health context is introduced, to provide context and rationale. Second, operational definitions of 'cardiometabolic disease' and 'sleep disturbance' are offered, to address many unclear operationalizations. Third, the extant literature is summarized regarding short or long sleep duration and/or insufficient sleep, insomnia and insomnia symptoms, general (non-specific sleep disturbances), circadian rhythm abnormalities that result in sleep disturbances, and, briefly, sleep-disordered breathing. Fourth, the review highlights the social/behavioural context of sleep, including discussions of sleep and race/ethnicity, socio-economic position, and other social/environmental factors, in order to place these findings in a social-environmental context relevant to public health. Fifth, the review highlights the issue of sleep as a domain of health behaviour and addresses issues regarding development of healthy sleep interventions. Finally, a research agenda of future directions is proposed.",

      "abstract": "The correlations between sleep and prolonged epileptic activity are discussed on the basis of the status classification of Gastaut (1983). Little information is available on the interrelation of sleep and the status of tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal status). Most important is the therapeutical management of these cases. Tonic seizures have been reported to occur in large numbers during NREM sleep in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A status-like increase is possible. Tonic seizures occur almost exclusively during sleep. Myoclonic status epilepticus arising (a) in the course of primary generalized epilepsy and (b) in the course of encephalopathies, are usually markedly attenuated during sleep. In absence status (petit mal status) synchronized sleep generally fragments the continuous discharge which is replaced by isolated bursts of polyspikes, or polyspike and wave complexes. The absence status can recur upon awaking during the night or in the morning. The abnormal EEG activity of a petit mal status can, however, occasionally persist during the whole night. Improvement as well as activation during sleep have been observed in elementary (= simple) partial status epilepticus; improvement seems to be more frequent. Epilepsia partialis continua may persist or decrease during sleep. An increase as well as decrease of motor phenomena has been observed during the REM stages. 'Epileptic aphasia' of childhood is associated with subclinical bioelectric status epilepticus during sleep. The electrical status epilepticus must be delineated as a separate group. The term encephalopathy related to electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep (ESES) has been proposed on the basis of associated psychic syndromes. This form of status epilepticus disappears during the waking state and during REM sleep. Cases with hypsarrhythmia without clinical signs may also be classified under the group of electrical or bioelectrical status. In some cases, a continuous hypsarrhythmia is observed only during sleep. In this context, one must also mention those patients who demonstrate continuous activation of spikes, or spike and wave potentials (without clinical seizures) during eye closure.",

Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

Cerca de 50% de la poblacion lo padece, y es un problema que se asocia con una serie de alteraciones: disminucion de la capacidad fisica, problemas de concentracion y atencion, multiples patologias se exacerban, lo que acaba produciendo una disminucion de la calidad de vida de la personas. Asi mismo se interrelaciona con multiples problemas tanto fisicos, como psicologicos y sociales que pueden agravar o ser causa a su vez de las alteraciones del sueno. Reconocer los problemas del sueno y clasificarlos adecuadamente permite determinar la necesidad o no de estudios complementarios, seleccionar el manejo mas adecuado en forma individual, recomendar el manejo no farmacologico (terapia cognitivo conductual, manejo del ambiente), y si fuera necesario, determinar el tipo de farmaco mas adecuado en funcion de la asociacion existente con otras patologias (enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva cronica [EPOC], depresion, ansiedad, sindrome de piernas inquietas, etc.). La pequena revision que se presenta tiene como objetivo presentar al medico general las bases para enfrentarse al paciente adulto mayor que padece de alteraciones del sueno. Sin pasar por alto que existen cambios producidos por el envejecimiento que ya de por si modifican el ciclo sueno-vigilia, ademas de considerar los cambios psicosociales que se presentan",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a clinical syndrome with a high degree of morbidity that may follow a traumatic event. PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "abstract": "textabstractThe term migraine stems from hemicrania, describing a periodic disorder consisting of\nparoxysmal unilateral headache, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia and/or\nphonophobia. Hemicrania was later changed to Latin words - hemigranea and migranea;\neventually the French cognate, migraine, gained acceptance in the eighteenth century and has\nprevailed ever since. A working definition of migraine is benign recurring headache and/or\nneurological dysfunction usually attended by pain-free interludes and often provoked by\nstereotyped stimuli (1). Migraine may be triggered by certain factors (red wine, menses, hunger,\nlack of sleep, glare, perfumes, periods of let down) and relieved by others (sleep, pregnancy).\nPremonitory symptoms occur hours to a day or two before a migraine attack with or without\naura. Migraine is more common in females, with a hereditary predisposition towards attacks and\nthe cranial circulatory phenomenon appears to be secondary to a primary central nervous system\n(CNS) disorder.\nThe Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS)\npublished the classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders in 1988 (Table 1.1) (2).\nThe terms “common migraine” and “classical migraine” have been replaced by “migraine\nwithout aura” and “migraine with aura”, respectively. These operational criteria have been\nvalidated by different approaches and have enabled us to distinguish different headache entities\nin a reliable manner (3-6). In recent years, the IHS criteria have been used world-wide in several\nmulticentre double-blind drug trials, which have shown a reasonably consistent response rate to\ntriptans (7), reflecting a consensus in the defined migraine group. In a recent MAZE survey, the\nMigraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire has been used to assess the impact\nof migraine on work, home and social lives. MIDAS scores confirmed the debilitating effect of\nmigraine; >50% of respondents had a MIDAS grade of III or IV, indicating moderate or severe\ndisability. Less than one-third of patients reported that their current medication was consistently\neffective and only 36% were 'very satisfied' with their current therapy (8). These results show\nthat migraine patients world-wide are still not receiving adequate treatment and a significant\nunmet need in migraine care still remains.",

      "title": "Report from the <scp>WPA</scp> Section on Psychiatry and Sleep‐Wakefulness Disorders",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, which is considered a psychiatric disorder itself, is the most common sleep-related complaint in the general population. Furthermore, complaints about sleep and wakefulness are among the most common and impairing symptoms in psychiatric patients. Disturbed sleep frequently precedes the onset of several mental disorders, exacerbates as mental disorders progress, and frequently presents as a residual and treatment-resistant symptom. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in sleep research and the treatment of sleep and wakefulness disorders in psychiatry, although many questions remain to be answered1. We still do not know exactly the causative link(s) between the various psychiatric disorders and sleep complaints, although it would be important to know, for instance, whether early treatment of sleep disturbances can prevent the development of depressive disorders. Moreover, the relationship between subjective complaints of insomnia patients and objective polysomnographic results remains elusive, and we do not know whether the health consequences of insomnia, for example on metabolic systems, are related to subjective or objective measures of sleep, or both. Besides objective methods for assessing sleep and wakefulness – such as polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, multiple sleep latency test, and maintenance of wakefulness test – there is now considerable literature on various biomarkers for sleep disorders. For insomnia, the measures with the highest performance include PSG-derived cyclic alternating patterns, actigraphy, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. These are followed by heart rate around sleep onset, deficient melatonin rhythm, and specific neuroimaging patterns, mainly reflecting the activity of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia2. For central disorders of hypersomnolence, novel measures derived from quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), high-density EEG, cognitive testing, structural and functional neuroimaging, and pupillometry have been proposed3. Significant progress has also been made in the assessment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. In addition to established laboratory protocols, circadian rhythms can now be assessed through long-term ambulatory monitoring of activity, skin temperature, heart rate, and light exposure4. Significant progress has also been made in the treatment of insomnia, emphasizing not only the role of appropriate pharmacotherapy but, above all, non-pharmacological treatment options. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is currently recommended as the evidence-based psychotherapy for chronic insomnia, also in patients with comorbidities5. This treatment includes techniques such as sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep education and hygiene, relaxation techniques, and cognitive restructuring. These techniques help strengthen the basic sleep-regulating mechanisms, including the homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm, and reduce sleep-related anxiety and arousal6. The treatment of insomnia in psychiatry should be based on an integration of pharmacotherapy (including novel medications, such as orexin antagonists) and non-pharmacological interventions, to address psychological and behavioral factors that contribute to the development or persistence of insomnia. It is particularly important to emphasize the need to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, getting up at the same time every day, even after a night of poor sleep, and to exercise regularly. Additionally, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and limiting naps and rest periods during the day are essential. To prevent insomnia, it is also important to limit screen time during the day and avoid screens (phones, tablets, TVs) at least one hour before bed. Several new wakefulness-promoting agents have been introduced for the treatment of central disorders of hypersomnolence7. Moreover, it is now well recognized that effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with mental disorders is critical for improving their response to treatment, quality of life, and overall health7. As the prevalence of sleep and wakefulness disorders has further increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in deterioration of mental health and increased alcohol and hypnotic use8, it is evident that mental health professionals require effective training in diagnosing and treating disrupted sleep. People with mental disorders can greatly benefit from mental health services that incorporate routine assessment and treatment of sleep and wakefulness disorders within standard care pathways. Consequently, the main aim of the WPA Section on Psychiatry and Sleep-Wakefulness Disorders is to educate psychiatrists in recognizing and giving appropriate attention to sleep disturbances (such as insomnia and hypersomnolence) and in being able to provide guidance to their patients on the importance of basic sleep hygiene rules. The education of psychiatrists should also include awareness on obstructive sleep apnea, which can manifest with psychiatric symptoms, including increased daytime sleepiness, fatigue or loss of energy, loss of interest or pleasure, irritability, mood swings, emotional instability, and cognitive dysfunction such as impaired memory, attention and executive functions. These psychiatric manifestations highlight the importance of diagnosing and treating sleep apnea promptly, as managing the sleep disorder can improve overall well-being and quality of life. Moreover, since 30-40% of patients with chronic insomnia fulfill diagnostic criteria for obstructive sleep apnea, screening for this condition should be performed before initiating any hypnotic medication. This is crucial, because medications such as benzodiazepines are contraindicated in patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea. Such screening can be performed with short questionnaires such as the STOP-BANG. This questionnaire consists of eight yes-or-no questions, focusing on snoring, tiredness, observed apneas, pressure (high blood pressure), body mass index, age, neck circumference, and gender (male). Each \"yes\" answer scores one point. A higher total score indicates a greater risk of obstructive sleep apnea9. Our WPA Section has been active for many years. Its activities have been focused on providing information about sleep and sleep-related disorders to clinical health professionals, as well as optimizing the diagnosis and therapy of sleep disturbances in patients with mental disorders. Since sleep is an interdisciplinary field, one of our main goals is to connect sleep specialists from around the world. We believe that our Section can mediate between basic researchers, clinicians, educational institutions, scientific professional societies, health care institutions, and governmental authorities, in order to improve the recognition and treatment of sleep disorders. Our Section's action plan for 2023-2026 includes several goals. A primary one is advancing research and knowledge about disturbances of sleep and wakefulness in patients with mental disorders, by fostering collaboration between basic researchers, clinical scientists, and health care providers. Additionally, we will keep focusing on education and training on diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, by organizing workshops, webinars and scientific conferences with WPA involvement. Furthermore, we will be active in promoting clinical practice guidelines, to improve the quality and interdisciplinary nature of care in people with mental disorders suffering from disturbed sleep. A major goal also pertains to engaging in policy and advocacy, by calling for pertinent actions in support of research and public health initiatives to improve access of patients with mental disorders to sleep medicine services. We will also be supporting the building up of networking and collaboration, by fostering relationships with scientific societies to promote interdisciplinary research and clinical care. To this end, our Section has already organized a highly successful symposium, \"State of the Art in the Management of Insomnia\", during the World Congress of Psychiatry in 2023. Finally, we intend to develop public sleep health campaigns to educate the public on sleep hygiene, health consequences of poor sleep, and prevention of sleep disorders. By implementing this action plan, our Section can play a pivotal role in advancing the field, improving patient care, and promoting the importance of sleep health in the broader mental health context.",

      "abstract": "Hearing loss can result from disorders or damage to the ear (peripheral auditory system) or the brain (central auditory system). Here, the basic structure and function of the central auditory system will be highlighted as relevant to cases of permanent hearing loss where assistive devices (hearing aids) are called for. The parts of the brain used for hearing are altered in two basic ways in instances of hearing loss: (1) Damage to the ear can reduce the number and nature of input channels that the brainstem receives from the ear, causing plasticity of the central auditory system. This plasticity may partially compensate for the peripheral loss, or add new abnormalities such as distorted speech processing or tinnitus. (2) In some situations, damage to the brain can occur independently of the ear, as may occur in cases of head trauma, tumors or aging. Implications of deficits to the central auditory system for speech perception in noise, hearing aid use and future innovative circuit designs will be provided to set the stage for subsequent presentations in this special educational session.

      "title": "STXBP1 Encephalopathy with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

Søvnsygdomme giver imidlertid ofte søvnbesvær og er dermed en vigtig årsag til søvnproblemer, hvorfor en total adskillelse af de to er umulig. Man kan ej heller udelukke, at samtidig forekomst af søvnbesvær ved søvnsygdomme kan have forstærkende effekt (f.eks. søvnbesvær ved søvnapnø), hvilket komplicerer adskillelse af årsag og virkning.

      "abstract": "The syndrome of delirium is one of the most common manifestations of acute illness or drug toxicity in older patients. Controversy surrounds the definition of delirium, because its manifestations are pleomorphic and its mechanisms poorly understood. The American Psychiatric Association, in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV), emphasizes four key features (Table 60.1). The first of these is disturbance of consciousness. Patients with delirium characteristically are less aware of their surroundings and have difficulty focusing, sustaining, or shifting attention. They become easily distracted and have difficulty following commands or maintaining a conversation. Accompanying delirium is an impairment of cognition and perception not attributable to prior or progressing dementia. This is manifested by memory problems, disorientation, misperceptions, hallucinations, and language problems (e.g., dysnomia, dysgraphia). The course of delirium is acute (defined as hours to days) and fluctuating (patients may be lucid during morning rounds yet combative or confused at night). Finally, delirium in an individual patient has one or more underlying medical etiologies.1 KeywordsFemoral Neck FractureNeuroleptic Malignant SyndromeAcute Confusional StateDelirious PatientElderly Medical PatientThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Diagnosis includes consideration of the presence of physical or mental illness, drug and/or alcohol use or abuse, a primary sleep disorder such as sleep-disordered breathing or periodic limb movements during sleep, changes in circadian rhythms, or poor sleep hygiene.

      "abstract": "espanolLa enuresis nocturna (EN) hace referencia a la incontinencia urinaria nocturna que tiene lugar al menos una vez al mes durante tres meses en ninos de edad igual o superior a cinco anos. La EN es mas frecuente en varones y suele tratarse de una EN primaria y monosintomatica. La EN primaria es aquella en la que no se ha logrado continencia minima de seis meses de forma previa. La EN monosintomatica no se asocia a sintomas nefrourologicos diurnos. La EN suele relacionarse con comorbilidades como el estrenimiento, trastornos del sueno o el TDAH. La predisposicion genetica, los antecedentes personales nefrourologicos y los trastornos psicosociales son algunos de los factores de riesgo en la EN del nino. El diagnostico es clinico y se basa en una historia clinica detallada, exploracion fisica completa y diarios miccionales y de ingesta. El diagnostico diferencial es muy amplio, englobando otras patologias como diabetes mellitus, infeccion de orina, enfermedades nefrourologicas, oxiuros y alteraciones neurologicas. Las pruebas complementarias no estan indicadas de forma rutinaria si la exploracion fisica es normal y no existen signos de alarma. El tratamiento debe individualizarse e incluye educacion sanitaria, terapia motivacional, dispositivos de alarma y farmacos. Los dispositivos de alarma son de eleccion y requieren implicacion del paciente y la familia. La desmopresina se prefiere en ninos con menos de tres noches mojadas a la semana, volumen miccional maximo diurno (VMMD) superior al 75%, edad superior a 9 anos o fracaso del sistema de alarma. El pediatra tambien debera abordar los problemas psicologicos y sociales que puedan derivarse de la EN. EnglishNocturnal enuresis (NE) refers to nocturnal urinary incontinence that occurs at least once a month for three months in children aged five years old or older. NE is more common in males and is usually a primary and monosymptomatic NE. Primary NE is one in which a minimum continence of six months has not been achieved previously. Monosymptomatic NE is not associated with daytime nephro urological symptoms. NE is often associated with comorbidities such as constipation, sleep disorders or ADHD. Genetic predisposition, personal nephro urological history and psychosocial disorders are some of the risk factors for NE in children. Diagnosis is clinical and is based on a detailed medical history, complete physical examination, and voiding and drinking diaries. The differential diagnosis is very broad, encompassing other pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, nephro urological diseases, pinworms and neurological disorders. Complementary tests are not routinely indicated if the physical examination is normal and there are not warning signs. Treatment should be individualized and includes health education, motivational therapy, alarm devices, and drugs. Alarm devices are of choice and require patient and family involvement. Desmopressin is preferred in children with less than three wet nights per week, maximum voiding volume during day-time (MVVDT) greater than 75%, age greater than 9 years, or failure of the alarm system. The pediatrician will also need to solve psychological and social problems that may result from NE.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Fatigue Among Female Academicians",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

      "title": "Urinary Incontinence1",
      "abstract": "The extent, misery, and costs of urinary incontinence are well known to readers of the Journal. Although much has been accomplished, there are still formidable barriers to clinicians’ efforts to control incontinence. These include physician and patient acceptance of incontinence as an expected accompaniment of aging; a lack of detailed knowledge of the relationships of incontinence with associated conditions such as dementia, depression, urinary infections, and vaginitis; scant empirical information to evaluate symptoms and physical signs; and little knowledge of the operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value) of urodynamic tests. Excluding acute or transient incontinence caused by sudden, acute illness or environmental conditions,1 established incontinence is usually due to four types, largely distinguished by urological pathology.2 Sphincter weakness incontinence (SWI) or urethral incompetence (UI) is involuntary loss of urine caused by increases in intra-abdominal pressure without bladder muscle contractions. This is usually associated with stress incontinence, the symptom of incontinence with coughing or exertion. Detrusor instability (DI) or detrusor hyperactivity (DH) is caused by involuntary contractions of the detrusor or bladder muscle sufficient to cause incontinence and is frequently associated with the symptom of urge incontinence, the loss of urine associated with a strong desire to void. Overflow incontinence (OI) occurs when bladder pressure exceeds maximal urethral pressure, due either to bladder distension from a urethral obstruction or an atonic bladder. Functional incontinence occurs with and without other pathology in individuals who are unable to toilet themselves independently due to chronic physical, psychological, or neurological dysfunction. Unlike many other medical conditions, currently these diagnoses can not be made by a short history, physical exam, and easily performed laboratory tests. The existing “gold standards'” of incontinence diagnosis—urodynamic testing—reflect a number of different tests, are expensive, and require referral to subspecialists. However, most incontinence is and always will be treated by geriatricians, internists, nurse practitioners, and nurses in the community and longterm care. These professionals need clear, reliable, and reproducible data on the ability of history questions and clinical bedside tests to detect treatable urinary pathology that causes incontinence. It is clearly necessary to refer certain patients for urodynamics, but the data should suggest how those patients can be identified and delineate the risks of empirical treatment and steps necessary to avoid these risks. Decision rules3 and algorithms4,5 have been proposed, but as of yet little data from comprehensive studies of the incontinent elderly support them. In this issue of the Journal, Wells et al. present data on the clinical characteristics, urodynamics, and the diagnostic usefulness of common tests in a large sample of women with established incontinence. They reconfirm the dismal suspicion of most geriatricians that while incontinence is a chronic problem and many patients do seek care for it, few continue with long-term therapy. In this well-educated, largely upper middle class sample, chronic diseases were common (86%), and the incontinence was not associated with significant dementia, functional disability, or negative health status. Wells et al. identified more SWI or UI incompetency (77%), relatively less DI or DH (25%), and about half the number of patients with normal bladders (7%) and overflow (9%) than seen in other studies of incontinent women.5,6 This probably represents the relatively healthy population, although the use of three separate tests (radiological, clinical, and urodynamic) for urethral incompetence may have identified more of these patients than other studies with less intense evaluations. Clinical diagnoses, easily made by the nurse practitioner using both symptoms and a “bedside'” test, were compared to urodynamic diagnoses and found to be accurate in 55%, over all diagnoses. As a first step in validating decision rules or office procedures for diagnosis, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of incontinence symptoms, signs, and tests can be determined. These concepts are widely used7 in determining the applicability of clinical data to the diagnosis of disease. In this determination, the diagnoses are made with the best available standard—“the gold standard.'” Sensitivity refers to the percentage of patients with the diagnosis who have the characteristic (symptom, positive test) in question. Specificity refers to the fraction of patients without the diagnosis who do not have the characteristic. The positive predictive value is the fraction of patients with a characteristic who have the diagnosis. The negative predictive value is the fraction of patients without the characteristic who do not have the diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity are attributes of the test or the symptom being evaluated, but predictive values are the characteristics most clinicians rely on as they specify the probability that a particular patient with a positive (or negative) test or symptom does (or does not) have the diagnosis. For the same test or symptom, the predictive value changes with changes in the prevalence of the disease in the population. Consequently, the prevalence of the disease must be available or estimated. The sequence of diagnoses identified and whether an algorithm should aim to exclude diagnoses or confirm them, depend on the characteristics of the tests. Ideally, available procedures should be able to confirm a diagnosis with a high degree of certainty (a high positive predictive value); alternatively, the test may be able to exclude it with a high degree of confidence (a high negative predictive value). The consequences of misdiagnosis should also be considered and be minimal or, at least, risk-free. A decision rule for incontinence should address the four diagnoses of established incontinence, but practically, office procedures for diagnoses exist only for SWI, DI, and OI. Ouslander's test for DI,4 (slowly filling the bladder by catheter while watching for uninhibited contractions) is not empirically established. Patients with overflow or obstruction can have normal postvoid residual bladder volumes, making simple measurement of this characteristic in the office unreliable. However, sphincter weakness can be identified by an office examination, the stress test. Additionally, therapy for SWI—estrogens and alpha agonists,8 carries little risk to patients with other categories of urinary pathology if misdiagnoses are made, unlike therapy for DI (anticholinergics). Consequently, it would appear that the first step in a diagnostic algorithm should be identification of SWI. According to Wells et al., the standing stress test, an examination for urinary leakage while coughing or sneezing with a full bladder, is useful for the diagnosis of SWI. It can be confused with cough-induced DI, as detrusor contractions can be induced by the coughing and cause urinary leakage five to 15 seconds later. However, the results of Wells et al. show that the standing stress test, as conducted in the office, is 50% sensitive for a urodynamic diagnosis of SWI or mixed SWI and DI, and 76% specific, with a positive predictive value of 88%. In other words, using these results in a similar population, there is an 0.88 probability that a patient with a positive stress test in the office would have sphincter weakness later demonstrated at urodynamics. Thus, the risk of false positives is 12%. Using symptoms with the stress test yields a more sensitive test at 94%, but due to a much lower specificity (13%) the positive predictive value drops to 78%. Before these results can be used with complete confidence, they need careful confirmation and extension to other populations with a lower prevalence of SWI (where the positive predictive value would be lower) and to populations of incontinent men. Using similar tests in the office, if these results are confirmed, clinicians can expect to be able to accurately identify about 50% of women with SWI. The women with a negative test could have SWI, DI, obstructions, or atonic bladders. A bedside test for DI might be able to separate out a group of patients with a high probability of DI and allow them to be effectively treated without initial urodynamics. A postvoid residual measurement, if high, may identify many of the patients with overflow incontinence, who could be referred to urologists.3 Each of these steps, and the role of therapy for patients who do not show evidence of a specific diagnosis, need careful study and validation. These studies should include carefully defined, large populations, specific diagnostic criteria acceptable to experts in urodynamics, and careful attention to the analysis to provide the data and validated approaches clinicians need to treat incontinence. The work by Wells et al. begins this process.",

This term covers at least four types of sleep disorders: difficult falling asleep, frequent awakening, too early awakening and impairment of sleep quality--sleep quantitatively sufficient but failing to produce a feeling of rest. Insomnia may be sporadic, short-lasting and chronic. The last type requires particularly medical assistance since impairment of sleep quality can lead to drug dependence. In every case of insomnia it should be tried to explain its cause /neurosis, depression, somatic diseases with symptoms leading to sleep disturbances, toxic factors such as alcohol, drugs, inappropriate sleep hygiene etc./. In the treatment the basic role is played by removal of causes and better observation of sleep hygiene. Hypnotic drugs are indicated in sporadic and short-lasting insomnia, but in chronic insomnia they should be used cautiously and not continuously. Barbiturates have been abandoned recently and benzodiazepines have replaced them. They are, however, fraught with numerous faults. Cyclopyrolones /Zolpidem, Zopiklon/ are the new generation of hypnotic drugs in which the negative features of benzodiazepines have been partly excluded. Their half-life is short, they cause no rebound effect, adverse effects are better tolerated and are less frequent, drug dependence is not produced.",

      "title": "The Effectiveness of Ablution Therapy in Reducing Insomnia inAdolescents Who Experience Relationship Failure",
      "abstract": "The inability to fall asleep or stay asleep, despite the opportunity, is known as insomnia. In addition to feelingdissatisfied with their sleep, insomniacs often exhibit one or more of the following symptoms: fatigue, poor energy,difficulty concentrating, mood swings, and decreased productivity. Acute insomnia is temporary and often caused byexternal factors. Sleep disorders that last at least three months and occur at least three nights a week are called chronicinsomnia. There are many causes of persistent insomnia difficulties. Many medications, such as benzodiazepines andantidepressants, are part of the treatment and consuming milk high in melatonin has also been shown to be beneficial.The aim of researchers to raise this phenomenon is to see the effectiveness of ablution in helping teenagers who areexperiencing failed relationships to sleep better at night. The research uses qualitative methods with participantobservation and in-depth interview procedures. According to research findings applying ablution before bed mayexperience less anxiety and better sleep quality. This is because the act of washing using ablution water has a calmingand spiritual impact. The importance of including religious therapy as a technique to help teenagers overcome sleepdifficulties caused by psychological stress due to failed relationships has a good effect in this research.",

      "title": "863 When sleep takes you to unwanted places?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Somnambulism is a parasomnia occurring in non-rapid eye movement sleep, and is characterized by ambulation as a disorder of arousal regulation. Sleep deprivation, alcohol abuse, fragmented sleep and certain medications can increase the risk of sleep walking. Report of case(s) Here we present a 35-year-old man with multiple triggers for sleep walking, resulting in recurrent parasomnia events over fifteen years. He had a history of bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic insomnia, moderate untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), anxiety with violent daytime behaviors, and prior alcohol abuse status post six years of sobriety. He was sent to our clinic due to increased frequency and severity of events, with nightly events for the last five years. Episodes were characterized by walking around the home, leaving the home, and driving on occasion. He reported at least one minor car accident as a result of sleep driving. He also reported an injury resulting from a fall in his home while sleep walking. Several security measures were implemented, including door gates, door alarms, and hiding car keys. His family slept in different bedrooms with locked doors for safety. The patient’s chronic insomnia improved with cognitive behavioral therapy, leading to an average sleep time of five hours per night with no reported hypersomnia or daytime fatigue. After his initial evaluation, he was referred for a mandibular advancement device for treatment of his OSA, due to prior poor compliance with positive airway pressure therapy related to his PTSD. Optimizing his OSA helped decrease arousals that might trigger sleep walking events. He also maintained close follow up with mental health for pharmacotherapy and psychological therapy. Treatment with clonazepam 0.25 mg at bedtime was initiated given the severity of his somnambulism. Conclusion The use of a benzodiazepine can reduce slow wave sleep duration by its effect on the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). Our patient had multiple risk factors for parasomnias, with severe, frequent episodes of sleepwalking leading to self-injury. His treatment involved both pharmacotherapy as well as optimization of underlying triggers. Support (if any):",

      "title": "1043 A Rare Case of Non-24-hour Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder in A Sighted Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder which causes failure of endogenous circadian rhythm cycles to synchronize to a 24-hour day. Despite an unknown prevalence in sighted people, it's thought to be rare. We present a case of a sighted patient with concurrent bipolar disorder who presented with excessive sleepiness since preadolescence, and was later found to have N24SWD. Report of case(s) A 29 year old woman with bipolar disorder presented with excessive daytime sleepiness and irregular sleep schedule since age 12. During her teenage years she often fell asleep at school, and she felt the sleepiness could be associated with psychotropic medication. As she grew up, despite her bipolar disorder was well-controlled, the daytime sleepiness persisted, which caused great challenge concentrating at work and difficulty holding a job. She denies cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or restless legs syndrome symptoms. She had no history of shift work or abnormal movements during sleep. Her bedtime advanced and cycled through a 24-hour period according to sleep diary. Her rise time maintains a consistent interval with her bedtime. Previously she had multiple sleep latency test and polysomnogram, after which she was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia. She was treated with several stimulants without much improvement. She was offered CBT-I but hasn’t gone. She failed trial of a standardized schedule and found it stressful. She tried melatonin and light therapy for a short time without much of success, she was subsequently started on tasimelteon and the clinical response is to be followed. Conclusion N24SWD is reportedly rare in the sighted population, with a possible different mechanism from that of the blind population. Behavioral and environmental factors might contribute to the dysynchrony between a normal central circadian pacemaker and a non-24-hour sleep-wake behavioral pattern. Our patient's sleepiness persisted despite her psychiatric disorders were in remission. Altered circadian rhythms are not uncommon in patients with psychiatric disorders, and circadian rhythm dysfunction may be a trait marker of bipolar disease. Some antidepressant are also found to cause potential iatrogenic circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Psychosocial interventions that target stabilizing daily rhythms in patients with concurrent psychiatric illness can be helpful. Support (if any)",

      "title": "Prevention and treatment",
      "abstract": "Preventive activity in the field of the biopsychosocial disorders of childhood can, like other forms of medical prevention, be classified as follows.♦ Primary prevention: action taken to prevent the development of the disorder in the first place, usually by removing the cause.♦ Secondary prevention: action taken to identify the disorder at its onset, or as early as possible thereafter, so as to prevent extension and to minimise duration.♦ Tertiary prevention: action taken to limit further avoidable disability arising from an established condition.Rational prevention is made easier if there is good understanding of the factors that may be related to the development of disorders. The presence of a risk factor implies that the individual has an increased likelihood of developing a disorder. Protective factors are those that reduce an individual’s likelihood of developing the disorder in the presence of a risk factor (or conversely those that enhance resilience), and vulnerability factors are those that increase likelihood of disorder. Thus, for example, the presence of parental marital disharmony is a risk factor for conduct disorder. If a child at risk for this reason has a good relationship with an adult outside the family, this can act as a protective factor, and if the child is educationally delayed, this may increase the child’s vulnerability to develop such a disorder. Therefore action to reduce risk and vulnerability factors, and to enhance protective factors and resilience, may result in successful prevention. Although perhaps the major responsibility for prevention lies in social and educational policy areas, as far as health professionals are concerned the onus for prevention in this field is largely, although not entirely, on those working in primary health care, such as general practitioners, community health doctors, and health visitors. Therefore emphasis in this section will be on activities that these professionals can undertake. However, those involved in secondary care, such as paediatricians, psychologists, and psychiatrists can also undertake activities of major preventive significance, particularly if there is a focus on high-risk groups (Boyle and Offord 1990). Social policy measures of potential preventive significance will be discussed first.Treatment methods in child and family psychiatry are scientifically less well established than in some, but by no means all, other branches of medicine. In particular, knowledge concerning the effectiveness of different types of treatment for particular disorders is often uncertain. Consequently, it is not surprising that treatment practice still varies quite widely from centre to centre. Nevertheless, much useful knowledge is available and the evidence base is increasing steadily (Hoagwood et al. 2001). This is as true for what does not work, as for what does (Turk 2005b). Further, although there is a need for far more evaluation of treatment methods in this field, there is already a substantial amount of evidence available concerning the effectiveness of different psychotherapy techniques for specific disorders (Fonagy et al., 2002a; Target and Fonagy, 2005; Weisz and Jensen 2001). In the following sections a number of methods of treatment are described, although it must be appreciated that many practitioners often use different forms of therapy in combination. In each case an attempt has been made to describe the form the treatment takes, the principles underlying it, indications and contraindications for its use, and evidence for its effectiveness. Some examples are given of its application in different types of facility: primary care, paediatric and psychiatric. For brevity, the case examples do not contain all relevant information. Names of children described, and some identifying data, have been altered to preserve anonymity.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose of Review: This article provides a review of disturbances of sleep comorbid with common neurologic disorders. Recent Findings: A wide variety of neurologic disorders are frequently complicated by comorbid sleep disturbances. In many cases, a bidirectional relationship appears to occur between sleep function and the neurologic disease, such that treatment of comorbid sleep disturbances may improve the symptoms of the neurologic disease. Summary: Neurologic disorders are often associated with abnormalities of sleep. Sleep influences the severity of both epilepsy and headache, and treatment of comorbid sleep disorders may improve seizure and headache frequency. Alzheimer disease is characterized by circadian phase delay and poor nighttime sleep and is strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Parkinson disease is associated with several sleep disorders, including insomnia, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, daytime hypersomnia, and sleep-disordered breathing. Hypoventilation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neuromuscular disorders often presents initially with sleep problems, and treatment with noninvasive ventilation improves survival and quality of life.",

      "title": "A possible link between circadian rhythm disorders and mood disorders",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm disorders are problems with your circadian rhythm, the internal body that keeps your biological processes in step. This cycle lasts about 24 hours. The term circadian comes from Latin words that mean “around the day.” Patterns of brain waves, hormone production, cell regrowth, and other activities are linked to this cycle. Your circadian rhythm plays a key role in things like when you sleep and when you wake. Your normal circadian clock is set by the cycle of light and dark over 24 hours. People with circadian rhythm disorders may have problems: Falling asleep, Staying asleep, Waking up too early and not being able to go back to sleep, Getting sleep but not feeling refreshed by it. Things that can cause circadian rhythm disorders include Shift work, Pregnancy, Time zone changes, Medications, Changes in routine, such as staying up late or sleeping in, Medical problems including Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, Mental health problems, Menopause. Various Circadian Rhythm Disorders include Jet lag, or rapid time zone change syndrome: This involves symptoms like too much sleepiness and a lack of daytime alertness in people who travel across time zones. It gets worse with each time zone crossed, especially when traveling toward the east. Shift work sleep disorder: This sleep disorder affects people who frequently rotate shifts or work at night. A conflict between someone’s circadian rhythm and the time of their shift can mean they get up to 4 hours less sleep than the average person. Delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS): This is a disorder of sleep timing. People with DSPS tend to fall asleep very late at night and have a hard time waking up in time for work, school, or social activities. It’s especially common in teens and young adults. Advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS): This is a disorder in which a person goes to sleep earlier and wakes earlier than they wanted. For example, they might fall asleep between 6 and 9 p.m. and wake up between 1 and 5 a.m. Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder: This disorder often affects people who are blind because the circadian clock is set by the light-dark cycle. With this condition, that cycle is disturbed. It can cause a serious lack of sleep time and quality at night and sleepiness during daylight hours. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder: With this disorder, people’s circadian rhythms are jumbled. They may sleep in a series of naps over 24 hours. Seasonal affective disorder and all the circadian rhythm disorders are related to a discrepancy between the duration of the solar day and the circadian cycle. The circadian cycle of humans and other mammals is close to one hour longer than the 24 hours period from sunrise to sunrise. Interestingly, birds show a circadian cycle of less than 24 hours and close to 23 hours. Terrestrial invertebrates, the insects provide the key to understanding this discrepancy. The earliest identifiably mammalian fossils are from the Permian era strata. Insect orders that first appeared in the Permian era include the Hemiptera (bugs), Orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers), Coleoptera (beetles) and the Neuroptera (lacewings). All of whose modern survivors show a circadian cycle longer than 24 hours in at least some stage of the life cycle. The insects whose ancestors first appeared in Mesozoic strata with the birds include Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Their modern survivors, like the birds, demonstrate a circadian rhythm shorter than 24 hours. It is proposed here that the duration of these animal classes circadian day may reflect the duration of the solar day at the time of their origin. There is now evidence for three large meteorite impacts on Pangea near the end of the Permian era, one in Wilkes Land of Antarctica, one near the Falkland Islands, and one just west of Australia. The eastward movement of the Australian, African, and Eurasian continent/plate and the southeastward movement of the Antarctic continents/plates suggest that those meteorites were moving eastwards and struck the planet obliquely. Having done so, they might have imparted momentum to the planet’s rotation and so accelerated it. This may mean that circadian rhythm disorders are the consequence of a change in the duration of the solar day due to a disaster and that daytime lethargy and depression may have had adaptive value to the mammals who survived that disaster. If this is true, it adds context to our treatment of these disorders with bright light and melatonin",

The elderly usually go to bed in early evening and wake up in early morning, and they also take several naps in the day time. The polyphasic sleep is one of the typical sleep patterns found in the elderly. Comparing the sleep of the elderly with that of young adults by the method of polysomnography, the characteristics of the sleep of the elderly are in the prolongation of sleep latency, shortening of total sleep time, increase of Stage W and Stage 1, decrease of Stage 3 and 4, and also decrease of Stage REM and the advance of REM phase. Insomnia is a frequently observed symptom in the elderly. The so-called psychophysiological insomnia due to transient psychological or situational stress is common in the elderly. However, insomnia following the mental disturbance (depression), chronic use of drug or alcohol, dementia (vascular or Alzheimer type) are also important in the elderly. Sleep apnea syndrome is recently found as an important cause of insomnia. Concerning the treatment and prevention of insomnia, it is necessary to exclude the causes of insomnia, to improve the environmental conditions and to keep the regular rhythm of sleep-wake cycle. It is also important to carefully select and use the adequate hypnotics considering the pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of the drugs in the elderly.",

Infant sleep apnea includes three entities: (1) apnea of prematurity, (2), apparent life threatening episodes with apnea and (3) obstructive sleep apnea. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome can be associated with other autonomic system illness, such as Hirschsprung disease (Haddad syndrome) and neuroblastoma. The implementation of the supine sleep position and smoking free homes has diminished the frequency of sudden infant death syndrome.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a disease but a symptom arising from multiple environmental, medical, and mental disorders. Insomnia can be transient, short-term, or chronic in its presentation. Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related personal discomfort. Chronic insomnia can be caused by neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders starting or persisting during sleep that hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity. Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation. Agrypnia excitata (AE) is the term which aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome, whose pathogenetic mechanism consists in an intralimbic disconnection releasing the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation from corticolimbic control.",

      "abstract": "(1) Most sleep complaints involve difficulties in getting to sleep or staying asleep, or not feeling refreshed on awakening. Misconceptions and worrying over the lack of sleep and its consequences can contribute to reinforcing these disorders; (2) How can patients who complain of poor-quality sleep be helped, without resorting to treatments that can have adverse effects? To answer this question, we conducted a systematic review of the literature based on the standard Prescrire procedure; (3) One effective approach is to explain the basic physiology of sleep, to discuss misconceptions, and to adopt a strategy of \"stimulus control\". This method has a similar efficacy to prescribing a benzodiazepine. and the effect is longer lasting; (4) Moderate, regular physical exercise, especially in the morning, seems to help some patients, but the evidence is weak; (5) Some clinical trials of phytotherapy have shown a positive risk-benefit balance of weak aqueous or hydroalcoholic valerian extracts. Efficacy is limited, however; (6) A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials showed that benzodiazepines and related drugs increase the duration of sleep and help patients to fall asleep sooner. However, none of these trials provides comparative data spanning periods of more than two weeks. Efficacy is uncertain in the longer term, as patients quickly develop a tolerance to the hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines; (7) The adverse effects of benzodiazepines include frequent memory disorders, daytime drowsiness, falls, fractures and road accidents, and a withdrawal syndrome after treatment cessation. Related drugs such as zolpidem and zopiclone provoke similar adverse effects; (8) Sedative antihistamines have not been as well-evaluated as benzodiazepines in this setting. Small comparative trials of doxylamine and diphenhydramine showed no major difference in efficacy versus benzodiazepines and related drugs. The main adverse effects of sedative antihistamines are daytime drowsiness and altered vigilance, and atropinic effects; (9) Case-control studies showed a statistical link between benzodiazepine use in early pregnancy and birth defects such as cleft lip. In contrast, data on the use of doxylamine during pregnancy are reassuring; (10) Other sedative psychotropics have not been adequately tested in this setting or have been shown to have a negative risk-benefit balance; (11) In practice, patients who complain of poor-quality sleep should be given appropriate information on the mechanisms of normal sleep and related misconceptions, on the best methods for getting to sleep, and on the dangers of sedative psychotropics (dependence, withdrawal syndrome). When prescribing or dispensing a benzodiazepine to a woman of child-bearing age, the risk of birth defects, although not clearly demonstrated, must be mentioned.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia, a more or less chronic sleep disturbance, is a very common symptom in psychiatric patients but also relatively freguent in the general population to a lesser degree. Two broad types of insomnia may often be distinguished: (1) difficulty falling asleep and frequent wakening, characteristic of anxiety states or obsessive worrying; and (2) early morning wakening, sometimes in a panic, suggestive of endogenous depression. The first group of patients respond well to minor tranquilizers and psychotherapy, whereas the second do well with tricyclic anti-depressants. Many studies in sleep laboratories have declineated the stages and cycles of sleep physiology and pathology, especially the importance of REM or dreaming sleep. The clinician should be cautious in the use of hypnotics like barbiturates which suppress REM sleep and produce a rebound increase on withdrawal, as well as problems of dependence of habituation. Flurazepam and chloral hydrate are considerably safer in this respect. Understanding sleep neurophysiology and biochemistry permits appropriate individual clinical management for both psychiatric patients and medical patients with conditions like peptic ulcer and nocturnal angina pectoris.",

ILesults suggested that at some stage during childhood, particularly under 8 years of age, the majority of children with autism will experience sleep problems. These problems are likely to be severe in many cases and will generally include one or more of. extreme sleep latencies; lengthy periods of night waking; shortened night sleep; and early morning waking. Such problems may have some specificity for autism as they appear to be rare in non-handicapped children and in children with mild degrees of intellectual handicap. It is likely that sleep problems in early childhood are related to the severe social difl:culties present in autism and the consequent inability of these children to use social cues to synchronise their sleep/wake cycle. Continued sleep dilticulties at older ages and with higher IQ may also be related to arousal and anxiety factors.",

There has been a lack of clarity regarding the definition of DNS, as many sleep-related symptoms and conditions disrupt sleep quality in narcolepsy (eg, hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, nightmares, restless legs syndrome/periodic leg movements, nocturnal eating, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety). In addition, the intrinsic sleep instability of narcolepsy results in frequent spontaneous wakings and sleep stage transitions, contributing to DNS. Sleep instability likely emerges in the setting of orexin insufficiency/deficiency, but its exact pathophysiology remains unknown. DNS impairs quality of life among people with narcolepsy, and more research is needed to determine its contributions to cardiovascular risk. Multimodal treatment is appropriate for DNS management, including behavioral therapies, counseling on sleep hygiene, and/or medication. There is strong evidence showing improvement in self-reported sleep quality and objective sleep stability measures with sodium oxybate, but rigorous clinical trials with other pharmacotherapies are needed. Treatment may be complicated by comorbidities, concomitant medications, and mood disorders.DNS is a common symptom of narcolepsy deserving consideration in clinical care and future research.Maski K, Mignot E, Plazzi G, Dauvilliers Y.

In this case, the insomnia developed during a life situation with social stress and continued over 30 years with a gradual sleep reduction to 2-4 hours. Our sleep recordings confirmed a total sleep time of nearly 3 hours, a marked rhythmicity of sleep and day-time activities, fragmentation of sleep, and psychogenic extrasystoles, all symptoms having been reported by the subject previously. Autonomic functions indicated a good efficiency of NREM sleep, whereas a first night effect with subsequent adaptation revealed a good regulatory function of the sleep-waking-system. In addition to a detailed documentation of this extraordinary case, an interpretation is undertaken in order to explain, how the insomnia developed and continued.

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

      "title": "The role of depression in coronary artery disease",
      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

Obesity or anatomic changes with aging affecting the upper airway may cause obstructive sleep apneas, which are associated with the development of cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric disorders. Symptoms of restless legs are also prevalent in the elderly, resulting in sleep-onset insomnia or frequent nocturnal awakenings.

      "title": "Pathophysiology and treatment of enuresis: Focus on sleep",
      "abstract": "Currently, nocturnal polyuria as a result of desmopressin deficiency, nocturnal detrusor overactivity and high arousal threshold is considered to be central to the pathogenesis of enuresis.1 The sleep of enuretic children might be deep, but possibly disturbed (by obstructed airways or by a distended or contracting bladder). Because both detrusor contractions and bladder distension are recognized as strong arousal stimuli,2 many investigators have speculated that there must be something amiss with the enuretic children's arousal mechanisms.1 A striking report came from Yeung et al., who demonstrated, using polysomnography and continuous cystometry, that the signals from an overactive bladder cause increased arousal during sleep, and that the sleep of enuretic children might in fact be disturbed by frequent, inefficient arousal reactions (an interaction between bladder overactivity and cortical arousability: a “bladder–brain dialogue”).3 They suggested that the transition from light sleep to awakening was suppressed by long-term overstimulation by signals from the bladder to the brain. Further studies had not been reported until Dhondt et al. found, using video-polysomnography, concomitant increased sleep fragmentation and abnormally increased “periodic limb movements” during sleep in treatment-resistant enuresis.4 In this issue of the Journal, Tsuji et al. report lower sleep efficiency assessed using a novel contactless biomotion sensor in enuretic children, and that this remained unchanged after successful treatment with enuresis alarm,5 although we might take into consideration the possibility that the Tsuji et al. patients were not polyuric at night-time (because those patients were treated with alarm, not by desmopressin). Recently, the Japanese Society on Enuresis issued clinical guidelines in which they proposed first-line therapy for monosymptomatic enuresis consisting of desmopressin and enuresis alarm,6 in accordance with the recommendation from the International Children's Continence Society.7 Desmopressin diminishes nocturnal polyuria, and the alarm can be presumed to act on sleep and arousal, but whether this occurs through some form of conditioning or resetting of the arousal thresholds is unclear.1 Nearly 15–20% of patients do not respond to the first-line therapy, and additional treatment involving anticholinergics or antidepressants is proposed for them. Anticholinergics can decrease detrusor overactivity, whereas antidepressants presumably have multiple noradrenergic and serotoninergic effects, acting on the central nervous system and/or the bladder.1 Still some enuretic patients are refractory to this second- or third-line treatment. Several preliminary anti-enuretic results have been reported recently for the following medications, which modulate the sleep condition of enuretic patients: melatonin,8-10 clonidine,11 and yokukansan.12 To clarify the mechanisms by which these drugs have a beneficial effect on enuresis, additional studies on patient sleep states using up-to-date methods, including the one reported by Tsuji et al.,5 are necessary.

Typically, individuals report less sleep and more wakefulness across a given sleep opportunity compared to that captured via objective methods (e.g. polysomnography) [1–3]. Many different terms have been used to describe this phenomenon since the 1970s [4], including but not limited to the following: sleep misperception [5], sleep-state misperception [6], sleep-state discrepancy [7], subjective-objective sleep discrepancy [3], sleep misestimation [8], and paradoxical- [9] and pseudo-insomnia [4]. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not yet well understood [2] and require future research to inform developments in the diagnosis and treatment (or management) of the disorder. The aim of this letter is to facilitate such work by highlighting recent findings and proposing a new nomenclature to become standard practice for describing this phenomenon. Insomnia is regarded as a “subjective” disorder, for which individuals’ perceptions of sleep and daytime functioning form the basis of its assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. However, objective measurements of sleep may also hold an important role. Clinicians have anecdotally reported that discussing the discrepancy between perceived and objectively measured sleep can be therapeutic. Preliminary findings [10] support this anecdotal evidence, suggesting that personalized feedback about the discrepancy between self-report (sleep diary) and objectively measured (actigraphy) sleep reduced the discrepancy on subsequent nights in a group of 40 individuals with insomnia when compared to those who received no feedback [10]. However, there is limited knowledge about the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon and the implications for the diagnosis and management of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are not only defining features, but also diagnostic criteria for most psychiatric disorders. Recently, researchers have proposed a theoretic role for sleep disturbances in emotion dysregulation, subsequently linking neurobiological processes and psychopathology. Most prior research examining the potential role for sleep disturbance in emotion dysregulation is from a neurophysiological or clinical perspective, or primarily focused on maintaining processes. Less well understood are how sleep disturbances may be involved at the levels of predisposition, precipitation, and perpetuation of emotion dysregulation concurrently and over time.This dissertation presents findings from three studies that were designed to expand on what is known about sleep disturbance in the predisposition, precipitation, and perpetuation of emotion dysregulation. Study 1 examined the long-term relation between sleep-onset problems and neuroticism over twenty-years. Adolescent sleep-onset posed risk (predisposition) for neuroticism in midlife, not vice versa. Study 2 investigated the effects of 3-nights partial sleep deprivation (5-hours total time in bed) on the positive and negative affect and emotions of otherwise healthy adults. Following partial sleep deprivation, people reported significant reductions in positive affect and emotions compared to rested people (precipitation). The only impact on negative emotions was on the discrete level. Sleep deprived peo-ple reported significantly more irritability, loathing, hostility, and shakiness compared to controls. Study 3 measured adolescent sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, and catastrophic worry. In addition to direct risk, sleep disturbances posed a non-gender specific risk for depressive symptoms one-year later through catastrophic worry (perpetuation). Overall, the results provide support for the role of sleep disturbances in the predis-position, precipitation, and perpetuation of emotion dysregulation. An implication is that sleep disturbances and catastrophic worry are two po-tentially modifiable markers of risk for emotion dysregulation.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is common: its cardinal symptoms can give rise to confusion with epilepsy \n\nNarcolepsy is a distinctive but underdiagnosed disorder of sleep and waking. Its cardinal manifestations are: ( a ) excessive daytime sleepiness, with a tendency to nap repeatedly through the day; ( b ) cataplexy, a loss of muscle tone triggered by emotion, causing immobility for seconds to minutes; ( c ) hypnagogic hallucinations, vivid visual or auditory phenomena, experienced at the onset of sleep; and ( d ) sleep paralysis, an inability to move on first awakening.1\n\nWhen a patient describes all these symptoms the diagnosis should be straightforward. Diagnostic difficulty arises when patients present with isolated symptoms, or if their story suggests some more familiar diagnosis. We report on three patients recently encountered in whom narcolepsy was initially mistaken for epilepsy. Indeed, Gelineau, the French physician who coined the term “narcolepsy” in 1880, was at pains to distinguish his novel disorder of sleep (narco from the Greek for “sleep” and “lepsy” for taken hold by) from epilepsy, with which he thought it might be confused. 2 3\n\nCase 1— A 26 year old woman was found in the bath “unable to move, speak, or get out.” Her husband reported flickering of the eyelids and muscle twitching. Her speech was slurred as she recovered, over minutes. The referral letter noted a history of short periods of apparent daytime sleep, sometimes at inappropriate moments—for example, during meals—and a tendency to “go weak and limp … if she is having a carry-on or laughing heartily.” The diagnosis at referral was of complex partial seizures; sodium valproate had been prescribed. It emerged that she had clear recall of her period of immobility in the bath: it resembled her episodes of weakness on laughing.

Some of these events can be violent and result in injuries to self or others, and some may even result in disability or death. There are no predictors to determine if a parasomnia will result in violence; hence, it is importance to learn to identify parasomnias in general and intervene when necessary. A detailed patient history is required to identify parasomnias. Video polysomnography is the recommended test to use, and additional electromyogram leads can be added to identify movement and correlate events with sleep or wakefulness. The polysomnogram is also helpful to determine presence of obstructive sleep apnea, which is a known precipitating factor for parasomnias. Other precipitating and predisposing factors are fragmented sleep, deprivation of sleep, alcohol, medications, disorders of sleep (eg, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, narcolepsy), and environmental triggers such as sudden noise, flickering light, or bed partner's snoring. Violent parasomnias that result in harm can be adjudicated to criminal courts, where investigation attempts to determine the presence of consciousness in the patient during the episode, indicating intent.

A 25-day trial is discussed here. 18 endogenous depressives who proved to be refractory to tricyclic antidepressive therapy were treated with periodic sleep deprivation (5 sleep deprivation treatments in the second half of the night at 5-day intervals) under continued drug therapy. The combined treatment led to a better result than would have been expected from drug therapy alone. Some of the sleep deprivation treatments effected an accelerated remission without the efficacy of treatment subsiding. In individual cases recovery occurred after one or a few partial sleep deprivation sessions. Whether in other respects sleep deprivation shortens the course of depressive phases is still unproven.",

Insomnia is a common sleep disorder, particularly among older adults, and is often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric conditions. Psychological factors play a critical role in onset and maintenance of chronic insomnia, such that cognitions and behaviors that occur in response to difficulty sleeping inadvertently condition arousal when attempting to sleep. In most cases, assessment of insomnia in clinical settings occurs via interview and self-monitoring using daily sleep diaries. The most well-established interventions for insomnia include cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic medications. CBT-I focuses on altering behaviors and cognitions that maintain insomnia using stimulus control and sleep restriction, among other strategies. CBT-I is considered the initial treatment of choice due to its strong efficacy and lower risk of adverse events as compared with pharmacotherapy.",

      "title": "Parasomnias",
      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical and/or experiential phenomena accompanying sleep that involve skeletal muscle activity (movements, behaviours), autonomic nervous system changes, and/or emotional-perceptual events. Parasomnias can emerge during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from any stage of sleep; therefore, all of sleep carries a vulnerability for parasomnias. Parasomnias can be objectively diagnosed by means of polysomnography (i.e. the physiologic monitoring of sleep—figures 4.14.4.1, 4.14.4.2), and can be successfully treated in the majority of cases. Understanding of the parasomnias, based on polysomnographic documentation, has expanded greatly over the past two decades, as new disorders have been identified, and as known disorders have been recognized to occur more frequently, across a broader age group, and with more serious consequences than previously understood. Parasomnias demonstrate how our instinctual behaviours, such as locomotion, feeding, sex, and aggression, can be released during sleep, itself a basic instinct. There are at least eight reasons why parasomnias should be of interest and importance to psychiatrists: 1 Parasomnias can be misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated as a psychiatric disorder. 2 Parasomnias can be a direct manifestation of a psychiatric disorder, e.g. dissociative disorder, nocturnal bulimia nervosa. 3 The emergence and/or recurrence of a parasomnia can be triggered by stress. 4 Psychotropic medications can induce the initial emergence of a parasomnia, or aggravate a preexisting parasomnia. 5 Parasomnias can cause psychological distress or can induce or reactivate a psychiatric disorder in the patient or bed partner on account of repeated loss of self-control during sleep and sleep-related injuries. 6 Familiarity with the parasomnias will allow psychiatrists to be more fully aware of the various medical and neuro-logical disorders, and their therapies, that can be associated with disturbed (sleep-related) behaviour and disturbed dreaming. 7 Parasomnias present a special opportunity for interlinking animal basic science research (including parasomnia animal models) with human (sleep) behavioural disorders. 8 Parasomnias carry forensic implications, as exemplified by the newly-recognized entity of ‘Parasomnia Pseudo-suicide.’ Also, psychiatrists are often asked to render an expert opinion in medicolegal cases pertaining to sleep-related violence.",

Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

Other medical issues which may affect sleep quality are common in childhood, and conditions such as asthma, anxiety, epilepsy, gastro-oesophageal reflux, eczema, constipation, hay fever and many more, can cause significant sleep disruption. These should be actively considered as part of the diagnostic evaluation and treatment optimised.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a common disorder among the general population, which has a chronic course and a heavy burden on patients and the health care system. Epidemiological papers on sleep disorders show that a large number of people complain of sleep disorders. Today, there are several classifications and definitions for sleep disorders, and first of all for insomnia. Insufficient sleep can contribute to the occurrence of rapid fatigue during the daytime, reduced activity, attention and efficiency. Studies have shown that long-term and severe sleep disorders can lead to and/or exacerbate various somatic, neurological and mental diseases. Insomnia can contribute to cognitive impairment. Although both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions are available, drugs are more often prescribed due to greater availability. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first line treatment for adults of any age. Pharmacological intervention may be offered, if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is not enough effective or not available. At the same time, the pharmacotherapy for sleep disorders remains problematic despite a large number of sleeping pills. Sleeping agents that are widely used in medical practice both in terms of their mechanisms of action and final results such as their effect on sleep do not always contribute to the development of natural (or at least close to physiological) sleep. Benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, melatonin, and phytotherapeutic medicines can be used to treat insomnia.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated that up to 20–30% of children have complaints or difficulties related to sleep that are regarded as significant problems by their families (1). Many of these problems simply fall within the realm of behavioral difficulties and/or bad habits; nonetheless, even minor sleep problems can be a source of distress, conflict, and insufficient sleep for more than one family member. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that insufficient sleep from any combination of causes can impact negatively on learning, behavior, and emotions. From a clinical perspective, it is essential to understand that, within this wide range of common sleep problems, there are a subset of serious and treatable sleep disorders in children and adolescents. Thus, the primary care clinician must have the requisite knowledge and clinical skills both to manage effectively common behaviorally based sleep problems and to identify appropriately the children who require further evaluation and treatment.",

Sleep problems are frequently reported by parents of children with autism with prevalence estimates of 44-83% for sleep disorders in this population. To better understand sleep in autism, we surveyed sleep problems in 210 children with autism using a Likert-based questionnaire for parent report. The most frequently reported sleep problems included difficulty in falling asleep, restless sleep, not falling asleep in own bed, and frequent wakenings. Least frequently reported sleep problems were sleep walking, morning headaches, crying during sleep, apnea, and nightmares. When surveys were divided into mental retardation (MR)/not MR categories, no significant differences were identified in frequencies of reported sleep problems except for waking at night which occurred much more frequently in the MR group. There was also no difference in sleep problems related to age of the child other than nocturnal enuresis. An association was noted between certain medical problems and sleep problems. Vision problems, upper respiratory problems, and runny nose were associated with decreased nighttime sleep. Vision problems, poor appetite, and poor growth were associated with increased nighttime waking. Poor appetite and poor growth were associated with decreased willingness to fall asleep. This study confirms a high prevalence of sleep problems reported by parents of children with autism and points to the need for more systematic research as an initial step in developing treatment strategies.",

The muscle jerks are not associated with arousals or awakenings. Prevalence is unknown but is believed to be rare. There is no difference between genders. It has a self-limited course, with resolution by 6 months of age in most infants. No specific therapy is necessary. Pathogenesis has been postulated to involve a possible developmental abnormality of the reticular activating system. Video-electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) monitoring during polysomnography demonstrate muscle activity with a frequency of four to five jerks per second, occurring in clusters lasting 3 to 15 minutes. It is generally observed during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep but can sometimes occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. No seizure activity is present on EEG tracings.",

While the identification of sleep cycles and diagnosis of sleep disorders are limited to lab-based assessment via polysomnography, the development of activity-based devices estimating sleep patterns provides greater insight into the sleep behavior of athletes in ecological settings. Generally, small sleep quantity and/or poor quality appears to exist in many athletic populations, although this may be related to training and competition context. Typical sleep-affecting factors are the scheduling of training sessions and competitions, as well as impaired sleep onset as a result of increased arousal prior to competition or due to the use of electronic devices before bedtime. Further challenges are travel demands, which may be accompanied by jet-lag symptoms and disruption of sleep habits. Promotion of sleep may be approached via behavioral strategies such as sleep hygiene, extending nighttime sleep, or daytime napping. Pharmacological interventions should be limited to clinically induced treatments, as evidence among healthy and athletic populations is lacking. To optimize and manage sleep in athletes, it is recommended to implement routine sleep monitoring on an individual basis.",

      "abstract": "Introduction For generations, parents have experienced the stress and frustration of increased, inconsolable crying in their infants in the first three to five months of life. In its most extreme manifestations, this increased crying has been considered a clinical problem, often referred to as “colic.” The most extreme and dangerous consequence for the infant is abuse or neglect, and especially the specific form of abuse referred to as “shaken baby syndrome.” Many of the properties of crying are unique to the first few months, and therefore generate their own particular problems. Later in the first year of life, the amount of crying is much reduced. However, more stable individual differences between infants appear. Those infants who tend to be more reactive and to respond negatively (by crying) can be completely normal, but they are often thought of clinically as having a “difficult temperament.” If the crying is associated with difficulties feeding and sleeping, they are often thought of in clinical terms as having behavioural regulation problems (“regulatory disorder”). While the vast majority of these crying behaviours are not associated with disease or pathology, the meaning of the crying behaviour for the infants’ caregivers (“perceptual set”) is usually a determinant of its psychosocial consequences for the infant. Although many questions remain, research findings have changed our understanding of the nature and significance of this early behaviour.",

The quality of life during the wakeful stage is heavily dependent on the quality of REM and non-REM sleep experienced, whether during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. The most restorative sleep is delta sleep (slow wave sleep or deep sleep) that occurs in Stages 3 and 4 of non-REM sleep; it is during these stages that one is the most difficult to waken. Individuals waken during REM sleep, but the state of being awake is normally so brief that it is not recalled later when in the true wake state. Rapid eye movement and generalized muscle atonia are characteristic of REM sleep; diaphragmatic movements and erections are the only muscle movements not inhibited.",

      "abstract": "Verkehrsunfaelle koennen bei den Beteiligten zu lang andauernden psychischen Beschwerden fuehren. Viele Betroffene leiden unter einer posttraumatischen Belastungsstoerung (PTBS). Die Symptome einer PTBS werden wie folgt definiert: A. Die Betroffenen sind einem Ereignis oder Geschehen von aussergewoehnlichen Bedrohungen ausgesetzt, das nahezu bei jedem tiefgreifende Verzweiflung ausloesen wuerde. B. Erinnerungen halten an (zum Beispiel sich wiederholende Traeume). C. Der Belastung aehnelnde Umstaende werden tatsaechlich oder moeglichst vermieden. D. Entweder werden wichtige Aspekte der Belastung nicht erinnert, oder es treten anhaltende Symptome auf mit zum Beispiel folgenden Merkmalen: Ein- und Durchschlafstoerungen, Reizbarkeit, Konzentrationsschwierigkeiten, erhoehte Schreckhaftigkeit. E. Die Kriterien B, C und D treten innerhalb von 6 Monaten nach dem Belastungsereignis oder nach Ende einer Belastungsperiode auf. Da Unfallbeteiligte ihre Extremerlebnisse oft nicht aus eigener Kraft loesen koennen, bietet sich die Einrichtung von Anlaufstellen an, in denen Personen und Informationen verfuegbar sind, mit deren Hilfe die organisatorische und psychische Bewaeltigung von Unfallfolgen besser als bisher erfolgen kann. Seit den 80er Jahren wurde psychologische Unfallnachsorge entwickelt und seit Beginn der 90er Jahre praktisch durchgefuehrt. Das Behandlungskonzept wurde im Rahmen des Koelner Modells auch auf den Bereich des oeffentlichen Nahverkehrs uebertragen.

      "abstract": "Dans le quotidien, l'être humain associe intuitivement un sommeil de bonne qualité au bon fonctionnement physiologique et psychologique. D'autre part, la douleur entraîne souvent un sommeil de mauvaise qualité, voire de l'insomnie. Parmi les patients souffrant de douleur chronique (p. ex. lombalgie, douleur orofaciale, fibromyalgie ou arthrite rhumatoïde), près des deux tiers rapportent que leur sommeil n'est pas suffisamment récupérateur. La relation entre la douleur et le sommeil est soit unidirectionnelle soit bidirectionnelle-circulaire. Une crise de douleur aiguë, précédant le plus souvent une plainte de mauvais sommeil, suggère une relation unidirectionnelle. Toutefois, chez les patients souffrant de douleur chronique ou intense (p. ex. post-brûlure), à une mauvaise nuit de sommeil succède une exacerbation diurne de la douleur qui, à son tour, peut diminuer la qualité du sommeil suivant et ainsi de suite. Il s'agit alors d'un trouble bidirectionnel circulaire. Des études polysomnographiques ont mis en évidence certaines caractéristiques physiologiques chez le patient souffrant de douleur chronique. La plus fréquente est l'intrusion d'ondes alphadelta électroencéphalographiques dénotant une activité corticale rapide normalement associée à l'état d'éveil. Cette intrusion, d'une durée de 20 à 40 secondes, répétée de façon périodique au cours du sommeil, reflète l'expression de micro-éveils cérébraux et du système nerveux autonome cardio-sympathique. D'autre part, des études expérimentales ont permi de caractériser les effets de la douleur sur l'architecture du sommeil. En effet, on a noté que la douleur induisait des éveils prolongés importants pendant tous les stades de sommeil (léger, profond etparadoxal) contrairement à ce que l'on pense généralement.",

      "title": "The Forgotten Child.",
      "abstract": "About 10% to 20% of children and adolescents suffer from some kind of mental health disorder. Many adult psychiatric disorders have their origin in childhood and adolescence. (1) Inadequate or delayed treatment is associated not only with personal suffering, compromised normal emotional and social development, and impairment in multiple domains including education, occupation, interpersonal relationships and self-esteem, but also family and carer stress. Yu et al (2) draw our attention to the mental health of mothers whose preschool children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Provision of a child mental health service in Hong Kong is shared by the Hospital Authority, Department of Health, the educational system, Social Welfare Department, non-governmental organisations, and private sectors. The worldwide trend of rising service demand, increasing public expectations and resource limitations is also noted in Hong Kong. Only some of those in need receive proper mental health treatment and care. (3,4) The underlying reasons vary in different settings. Examples include underdiagnosis, misdiagnosis, inaccessibility of service, poorly coordinated and fragmented services, lack of expertise, lack of public (or professional) awareness, and other obstacles to service seeking, such as stigmatisation towards mental problems and mental health care. (5) Different strategies have been proposed and initiatives implemented in an attempt to tackle these challenges. Fung et al (6) describe and discuss the results of a knowledge contact--based anti-stigma campaign in a Chinese society. While mental health problems in some patients are more eye-catching, such as the patient described by Che (7) who readily caught the attention of mental health professionals, others may present with more subtle symptoms. There is always an important but forgotten group of children and adolescents who are in need of more attention and proper mental health assessment and/or intervention but sadly have little access to the existing system. Some are 'at risk' of future development of psychopathology and are simply not being recognised or ignored. Some are hesitant or reluctant to seek help because they fear being stigmatised. Some fail to reach the service 'threshold' for referral. Others simply fall through the cracks because they fulfil nobody's criteria for help. If we agree that we should identify this group of children who are being 'forgotten', where should we invest our effort? It is well documented that mental disorders run in families. Genetic factors play a significant aetiological role in many mental health problems. (8) Siblings of an affected child are at increased risk of psychopathology due to a complex interplay of gene-environmental factors. (9) Chan and Lai (10) explore the psychological adjustment of siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder in Hong Kong. Children of parents who had psychopathologies are another vulnerable group. (11) Peers of suicide completers and attempters are at risk of psychiatric disturbance and suicidal behaviour. (12) Those who have been referred to the mental health service, but subsequently disappear from the system may be a group who deserve extra attention. There is always a group who (the affected child and/or parents) are inadequately motivated to seek intervention or help, and this could be due to multiple different reasons. How much additional effort, given the limited resources (e.g. long waiting list for initial child psychiatric outpatient assessment and long waiting list for psychosocial intervention), are we willing to make to reach out to and engage this group? The dilemma is more obvious for non-priority cases who previously received 'conventional intervention' (e.g. no imminent risk of aggression, suicide, or child abuse). CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service) traditionally offers service for those at the severe end of the spectrum, through referral from primary and secondary mental health workers. …",

They may also characterize some frontal or temporal nocturnal seizures of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, or be considered as part of NREM parasomnias, especially sleepwalking, sexsomnia or sleep-related eating disorder, or REM-related behaviors such as REM behavior disorder or complex movements associated with pediatric narcolepsy type I. In most cases rhythmic movements, especially when complex and long in duration, are related to different levels of arousal from sleep with recurrence of ancestral motor sequences promoted by central pattern generators in the brainstem, generally activated by the arousal process. A differential diagnosis between physiological events and pathological movement disorders, and between the latter and sleep-related epilepsy is critical to provide optimal treatment and an accurate prognosis. Specific treatment options for the aforementioned disorders are beyond the scope of this article.",

They also had lifelong histories of more illnesses and somatic complaints, beginning with more childhood illnesses and more childhood problems related to eating and sleeping. During childhood, insomniacs reported more frequent discontent with their families, and prior to the onset of insomnia, they had less satisfying relationships with their parents as well as problems in other interpersonal relations and in their self-concepts. Currently, insomniacs felt considerably less satisfied with their lives, had lower self-concepts, and had greater difficulty with interpersonal relationships. Thus, stressful life events, mediated by certain predisposing factors of personal vulnerability, were found to be closely related to the onset of chronic insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Complex visual hallucinations may affect some normal individuals on going to sleep and are also seen in pathological states, often in association with a sleep disturbance. The content of these hallucinations is striking and relatively stereotyped, often involving animals and human figures in bright colours and dramatic settings. Conditions causing these hallucinations include narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome, peduncular hallucinosis, treated idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia without treatment, migraine coma, Charles Bonnet syndrome (visual hallucinations of the blind), schizophrenia, hallucinogen-induced states and epilepsy. We describe cases of hallucinosis due to several of these causes and expand on previous hypotheses to suggest three mechanisms underlying complex visual hallucinations. (i) Epileptic hallucinations are probably due to a direct irritative process acting on cortical centres integrating complex visual information. (ii) Visual pathway lesions cause defective visual input and may result in hallucinations from defective visual processing or an abnormal cortical release phenomenon. (iii) Brainstem lesions appear to affect ascending cholinergic and serotonergic pathways, and may also be implicated in Parkinson's disease. These brainstem abnormalities are often associated with disturbances of sleep. We discuss how these lesions, outside the primary visual system, may cause defective modulation of thalamocortical relationships leading to a release phenomenon. We suggest that perturbation of a distributed matrix may explain the production of similar, complex mental phenomena by relatively blunt insults at disparate sites.",

      "title": "Waking up to the importance of sleeping well for cardiovascular health",
      "abstract": "The potentially adverse impact of poor sleep quality, insomnia, and other sleep disorders on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been the subject of increasing exploration over the past decade. Obstructive sleep apnea has been the most extensively studied sleep disorder in relation to hypertension, and is thought to be causally related through mechanisms including heightened sympathetic nervous system activity and vascular endothelial dysfunction that are triggered by sleep-disordered breathing.1 A growing body of research evidence has also revealed relationships between insomnia and CVD. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder and is defined by subjective reports of difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking too early.2 With insomnia, both sleep quality and duration are often impaired. Although a diagnosis of insomnia disorder may be based on self-report alone, objectively assessed insomnia features using polysomnography reveals longer sleep onset latency, more frequent nocturnal awakenings, and prolonged periods of wakefulness during the sleep period relative to normal sleepers.3 Observational studies employing objective sleep measures show that individuals with insomnia are more likely to have CVD, even after controlling for comorbid sleep disorders, and other potentially confounding comorbidities.4 Short sleep duration has also been associated with an increased risk of heart disease, higher blood pressure (BP), metabolic syndrome, greater coronary calcification, and higher levels of stress hormones.5 An important pathway through which sleep may affect CVD risk is through its relationship with BP, with substantial support for an association between insomnia and incident hypertension.6, 7 For example, in a prospective study of 786 men and women from the Penn State Cohort, those with chronic insomnia, determined by polysomnographic study and subjective reports of sleep problems persisting for over a year, were at over twice the risk of developing hypertension over a 7.5-year follow-up period. Furthermore, chronic insomnia coupled with short sleep duration (<6 hours) was associated with a fourfold increased risk of developing hypertension.8 Other studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, have reported similar observations, reinforcing the perspective that insomnia, when coupled with short sleep duration, may be especially hazardous in terms of its association with hypertension and CVD.9-11 Poor sleep quality is a widespread problem, commonly reported by patients with a variety of medical and mental health conditions,12, 13 as well as among those with diagnosed sleep disorders. However, the potentially broad impact of poor self-reported sleep quality on CVD risk has received relatively little attention. In the current issue of the Journal of Clinical Hypertension, Lo and colleagues report14 an informative meta-analysis examining the association between subjective sleep quality and BP. The authors include data from studies based on over 45 000 participants spanning five continents and provide formal analyses of studies that assessed subjective sleep quality using the well-established and validated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.15, 16 Their analyses showed that poor subjective sleep quality was associated with higher BP and an increased likelihood of hypertension. The impact of poor sleep quality is perhaps likely to be most conspicuously reflected in BP during the nighttime sleep period. Ambulatory BP monitoring studies have established that BP typically exhibits a circadian rhythm characterized by a fall in pressure during the nighttime sleep period. Relative to daytime pressure, a nighttime dip in BP of ≥10% is considered normal and individuals with this level of BP dipping are referred to as BP dippers, whereas a nighttime BP dip of <10% describes nondippers.17 Lo and colleagues found that in the subset of studies in their meta-analysis, which used both the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and ambulatory BP monitoring, BP dippers were characterized by better sleep quality than nondippers. Other studies, using subjective as well as objective measures of sleep quality derived from polysomnography and actigraphy, also have shown poor sleep quality to be associated with a blunting of the normal nighttime dip in BP.18-22 The nondipping circadian BP profile is associated with target organ damage, including cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy and chronic kidney disease23, 24 and is a strong prognostic indicator of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for both patients with and those without hypertension.23, 25-28 This evidence underscores the importance of BP measured during the nighttime sleep period, reflecting its greater prognostic significance than clinic BP, or ambulatory BP assessed during the daytime.29 Nonetheless, the physiological mechanisms accounting for blunted nighttime BP dipping and elevated nighttime BP are not well understood.30 Sympathetic nervous system activity normally shows a substantial decline from daytime waking activities to nighttime sleep, but the magnitude of this decline is attenuated in the context of a nondipping nighttime BP profile.21, 31, 32 Heightened nighttime sympathetic nervous system activity would favor peripheral vascular constriction, resulting in abnormally elevated systemic vascular resistance during the sleep period.33 The contribution of vascular disease to a blunted nighttime BP dip is supported by observations that a nondipping circadian BP profile is approximately twice as common in patients with coronary heart disease compared with age-matched healthy controls.34, 35 Blunted BP dipping has also been associated with impaired vascular endothelial function in women with untreated hypertension.35 As might be anticipated, in a study of men and women with hypertension, the hemodynamic mechanism related to a nondipping BP profile was a failure for systemic vascular resistance to show a normal decline during the nighttime sleep period.37 In view of the well-established pathophysiologic significance of elevated systemic vascular resistance in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension,38 coupled with the prognostic significance of elevated nighttime BP, it is not difficult to appreciate the potential importance that sleep quality may have in the pathogenesis of hypertensive heart disease. The available evidence therefore clearly implicates poor sleep quality and insomnia as risk factors in the cause of hypertension. It also suggests that in the context of high BP and hypertension, poor sleep quality may exacerbate hypertension by promoting target organ damage and increasing the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. However, the critical question of whether poor sleep quality is a modifiable risk factor for hypertension and CVD remains unanswered. In 2016, the American Heart Association published a scientific statement calling for research aimed at better understanding the association between sleep duration, sleep quality, and insomnia with CVD.39 Despite the wealth of available evidence, it is almost all observational, and the existence of a causal relationship between insomnia and CVD remains conjecture rather than inference. However, there is some preliminary evidence suggesting that sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for hypertension. In a pilot study of 22 adults with high BP, who slept <7 h/d, 13 were randomized to a 6-week intervention designed to extend the sleep period and 9 to a control condition.40 Those in the sleep-extension group showed a postintervention increase in sleep duration of 35 minutes following the intervention, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in 24-hour BP, whereas no significant changes occurred in the control group. We now need more well-designed randomized controlled trials to test the broad hypothesis that improving sleep quality in individuals with insomnia or subjectively reported sleep problems will reduce the risk of developing hypertension, as well as help control BP in those with hypertension, ultimately reducing the risk of adverse clinical events. Examining the effects of pharmacological treatments to improve sleep would be of interest, but interventions using cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia may be especially informative. Cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia is safe and effective and is the current gold standard for insomnia treatment.41 Therefore, it is ideally suited for intervention trials in healthy individuals and in patients with hypertension and/or other medical and psychiatric comorbidities.

Even though there are specific biological treatments, such as medication for restless legs syndrome, wake-promoting medication for narcolepsy and positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnoea, these are not always perfectly effective and there may be a role for adjunctive treatments that address the distress and emotion that become part of these chronic conditions and add to their impact. For people with milder symptoms, psychological treatment alone may provide sufficient symptomatic relief.

Common evening and night time disorders also include restless legs syndrome and associated periodic limb movements of sleep. Screening questions often help to identify the sleep problem that you are dealing with (box 1). Thereafter, sleep problems are best characterised on the basis of a thorough history. A collateral history from the bed partner is often helpful to define any restless legs, sleepwalking or parasomnia, snoring, and breathing abnormalities. Discussing the patient’s ideas about sleep, any concerns they might have, and their expectations of normal sleep is often worth while. #### Box 1: Sleep history questions",

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

The consequences of these sleep disturbances on everyday activities are not well documented and are therefore not considered in the evaluation of independence in activities of daily living ( ADL s). The goal of this narrative review is to explore the consequences of poor sleep quality on cognition and ADL s in the acute and subacute stages of a moderate and severe TBI , when patients are in acute care or inpatient rehabilitation. Methods We will present an overview of normal sleep and its role in cognitive functioning, and then present the findings of studies that have investigated sleep characteristics in hospital settings and the consequences of sleep disturbances on ADL s. Results During hospitalisation, TBI patients present severe sleep disturbances such as insomnia and sleep fragmentation, which are probably influenced by both the medical condition and the hospital or rehabilitation environment. Sleep disruption is associated with several cognitive deficits, including attention, memory and executive function impairments. Poor quality and/or insufficient quantity of sleep in acute TBI probably affect general functioning and ADL s calling for these cognitive functions. Conclusions and Significance The cognitive impairments present following TBI are probably exacerbated by poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation during hospitalisation, which in turn impact ADL s among this population. Health‐care personnel should further consider sleep disturbances among people with TBI and a sleep protocol should be established.",

      "abstract": "Abnormal drowsiness during the day is defined on the basis of three criteria: 1. subjective feeling of increased tiredness, 2. objective observation of attacks of falling asleep, 3. detection of premature falling asleep in the multiple sleep latency test. About 3 to 4% of the population of modern industrial countries complain of this symptom which very quickly leads to inability to work in numerous occupations (driving instructors, lorry drivers, airline pilots). In many cases, the symptoms can be eliminated by effective methods of treatment. Early diagnosis and therapy is hence an important task of physicians. Clinically suitable tools and methods of measurement for appraising the phenomena are at present: 1. the multiple sleep latency test (Richardson et al., 1978), 2. the multiple staying awake test (Mitler et al., 1982), 3. the vigilance test according to Quatember and Maly from the Vienna test system. In neurophysiological terms, an attempt is made to differentiate between: REM drowsiness, non-REM drowsiness, hypofunction of the arousal systems of the reticular formation, and hyperfunction and overstimulation of the arousal systems of the reticular formation (over-aroused tiredness). Approaches to a clinical typology of abnormal drowsiness are available from two points of departure: 1. Forms of permanent somnolence which are not alleviated but intensified by a brief restorative sleep and resemble the 'oversleeping syndrome' of the healthy individual. 2. Attacks of imperative falling asleep in narcoleptic patients. The characteristic of this form of abnormal drowsiness during the day is that in the interval between the attacks of falling asleep patients can take on any healthy person with regard to alertness, reaction capacity and ready wit. After a brief restorative sleep of less than 5 min., they immediately feel fresh, alert and fit again.",

Importantly, rates are rising during the pandemic.Suicidal symptoms can develop with depression and, less commonly, with anxiety disorders.In 2019, almost 25% of girls and more than 10% of boys seriously considered suicide.Symptoms are especially common among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) youth and Black youth.If you are worried your child is thinking about self-harm, contact a health care professional immediately.Parents, teachers, and pediatric primary care clinicians can monitor for signs of depression and anxiety including school difficulties, changes in sleep or eating, getting along with friends or family, withdrawing from activities, and using screening questionnaires for depression or anxiety in health care visits.Depression and anxiety are treatable with therapy that teaches specific skills, medications, or both.Specific treatment plans de-pend on age, severity of symptoms, ability to access therapy, and family preferences.Families can take care of your own mental health, talk about feelings starting at an early age; teach and model healthy coping strategies; keep your child safe from weapons, abuse, and preventable incidents; and talk to your child's health care professional.Some family and community health strategies to prevent depressionandanxietyincludeparentsaccessingtheirownmentalhealthcare; teaching families skills for effective communication and managing feelings;introducinganti-bullyingandantidiscriminationactivities;supporting families to access basic needs like food and safe housing; and preventing exposure to extreme stresses like abuse and disasters.",

Insomnia and sleep deficiency are also more prevalent as pregnancy progresses, possibly related to pregnancy-related physical symptoms or discomfort. There is increasing evidence indicating that these sleep problems may be associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes such as depressive symptoms, increased pain during labor, more Caesarean sections, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Treatment of insomnia remains challenging as some of the more commonly used sleep inducing medications such as benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists may be associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. Nonpharmacological treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy are available but the data in pregnancy is often lacking.",

NREM arousal parasomnias occur in 2% of adults and are often triggered by sleep deprivation, emotional stress, circadian rhythm disorders, and sleep fragmentation. Disorders of arousal include confusional arousal, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Research into the pathogenesis of arousal disorders in adults suggests that they reflect aberrant slow-wave sleep regulation, impaired arousal specifically from NREM 3 sleep, and/or sleep/wake state dissociations. Treatment of DoA includes avoidance of sleep deprivation/restriction, irregular sleep/wake schedules, and predisposing/precipitating factors. Pharmacotherapy can be considered when events pose a danger and/or sleep disturbance to the patient and/or others; involve potentially violent, dangerous, or sexual behavior; are frequent, chronic, and refractory to initial therapies; and/or have secondary consequences such as excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired quality of life, excessive weight gain, and injuries.",

A total of 409 sleep disorder patients were studied with all-night polysomnogram recording, and 53 (13%) had PMS. Such movements occurred in a wide variety of sleep-wake disorders in addition to insomnia. The prevalence and magnitude of PMS were not statistically greater in patients with insomniac disorders than in those with syndromes of excessive daytime sleepiness or other sleep-wake disorders. The results suggest that although PMS is responsible for disturbed sleep in relatively few patients, chronic sleep-wake disturbance is associated with PMS and may lead to the development of these movements.",

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "title": "Sleep EEG in Patients with Primary Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nWith the advent of the electroencephalographic study of sleep (1-3) and the more comprehensive\nmethodology of polysomnography (4), the era of the objective assessment of sleep had arrived.\nAlong with this technology, came the promise that sleep related complaints could be accounted\nfor by abnormal physiologic function during sleep. That is, it was believed that the simultaneous\nand long duration monitoring of sleep continuity and sleep architecture along with pulmonary,\ncardiac, motor, and cortical function would reveal the abnormalities that account for sleep initiation and maintenance problems, the report of shallow and/or fragmented and/or nonrestorative\nsleep, and/or the diurnal complaints of sleepiness and fatigue. To a large extent this promise was\nrealized for the complaint of shallow and/or fragmented and/or nonrestorative sleep, and/or\nthe diurnal complaints of pathologic sleepiness. The polysomnographic study of sleep revealed\nthat these complaints were, in large measure, directly related to sleep disordered breathing. The\npromise, however, was not realized for the complaint of insomnia (sleep initiation and maintenance problems). In fact, the very effort to objectively measure sleep continuity disturbance1\nraised more questions than it answered. That is, the objective assessment of sleep with electroencephalography brought into sharp resolution that remarkable discrepancies existed between the\nsubjective and objective measure of sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings,\nand total sleep time (4,5). Further, no evidence was obtained for physiologic abnormalities that\nclearly accounted for difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep (e.g., abnormal REM pressure,\nslow wave sleep deficiency, sleep onset related central apneic events, sleep induced cardiac or\nCNS irregularities, etc.). At best some of these factors were found to be indicative of “Secondary\nInsomnia” and particularly the sleep of patients with major depression (6,7).",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy and sleep apnoea are the commonest causes of persistent daytime sleepiness. There are approximately 20 000 people with narcolepsy in the United Kingdom, 100 000 in the United States. The diagnosis of narcoleptic syndrome is established by the history of recurrent daily short sleep attacks in combination with cataplexy, brief episodes of loss of muscle tone and paralysis. Narcolepsy often results from monotony, and cataplexy is usually due to a sudden increase in alertness, with laughter or surprise. About one-half of all subjects also have sleep paralysis, and many describe vivid dreams at sleep onset, or even during wakefulness. In classic cases, the diagnosis is obvious from the history, and also from the finding of at least two sleep-onset REM periods during a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The MSLT gives an index of daytime drowsiness, with measurement of the time of sleep onset at 2-h intervals on five occasions throughout the day.",

The answer may be found in congenital “Monophtalme” syndrome which appears during the first months of life with severe unilateral congenital organic amblyopia. The vision of the “sound” eye does not develop normally because there is no symmetrical binocular stimuli during these first few months of life. The fixation thus remains immature with an attraction of the fixation-pursuit system towards adduction. The clinical complications that result are: (a) a preference towards adduction which induces a torticollis; (b) a manifest/latent nystagmus (Drift/Adduction) of variable intensity with impaired vision in the Primary Position (PP). The more severe the organic defect, the more pronounced the visual functional defect of the viewing eye. Very early cataract extraction seems to attenuate the symptoms, probably because it allows more symmetrical (light?) retinal stimuli during the development of monocular fixation.",

The paradox refers to the disparity between the alert EEG pattern, implying that the person is awake or nearly so, and the indications that the person is actually more deeply asleep than at other times (difficulty in arousing, reduced muscle tone). The lack of muscle tone prevents the sleeper from performing the activities reflected in the alert EEG pattern. REM without atonia or REM behavior disorder is a sleep disorder in which the atonia fails to occur, with the result that the sleeper may actually perform his or her REM sleep actions.",

As we age, getting to sleep or staying asleep often becomes increasingly difficult. Sometimes this relates to life stressors; lying in bed ruminating about the day’s events is a frequent cause of insomnia. Depression is a common human affliction and insomnia may be one symptom.

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

Moreover, sleep problems in children often have a major impact on family relationships and functioning and may lead to significant parental fatigue, stress, and low mood. Numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors may influence the development of sleep problems and their maintenance, ranging from genetic vulnerability, prematurity, medical problems, and neurodevelopmental disorders to behavioral and socio-environmental factors, such as poor sleep hygiene, ineffective parental sleep-related behaviors, and exposure to academic, social, or family stressors. Given the high prevalence of pediatric sleep problems and associated harmful consequences, assessment of these problems by primary child healthcare providers should be included in any medical or mental health evaluation. Fortunately, there are various evidenced-based effective behavioral and medical interventions that are used to treat specific pediatric sleep disturbances. This chapter describes common sleep disorders in infants, children, and adolescents, including insomnia, parasomnias, circadian problems, sleep-related movement disorders, and obstructive sleep apnea. Current evidence regarding the phenomenology, etiology, assessment, and evidence-based treatment options is addressed pertaining to each disorder.

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant.

      "title": "Trastorno por déficit de atención con hiperactividad: autorregulación emocional y funciones ejecutivas",
      "abstract": "El Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad (TDAH, en lo sucesivo), constituye uno de los trastornos del desarrollo neuropsicologico que en la actualidad afecta a mas ninos y adolescentes, se estima una prevalencia de en torno al 5%, segun el DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association, 2013); y en el que coexisten diversos sintomas que van a ocasionar a la persona que lo padece serias dificultades para poder adaptarse de forma optima a los contextos en los cuales se ve inmersa. Dicho trastorno se caracteriza por un patron persistente de hiperactividad/impulsividad y/o inatencion superior a lo esperado de acuerdo con el nivel de desarrollo del individuo, apareciendo antes de los doce anos y alterando el funcionamiento normalizado del sujeto a nivel academico, familiar y social (Barkley, 2006; Lavigne y Romero, 2010; Miranda, 2000, 2004; Perez, 2009; Servera, 2005). El problema del que se parte para llevar a cabo nuestro estudio gira en torno a la escasa cantidad de investigaciones que existen con el objetivo de analizar los deficit que van mas alla de estos tres sintomas categoriales y que se producen a nivel social y emocional en los sujetos con Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad; especialmente en comparacion con el robusto cuerpo de estudios que se han llevado a cabo para profundizar en el origen y desarrollo de las alteraciones de corte cognitivo y conductual, asi como en las diferentes opciones que se ocupan de su diagnostico y tratamiento. Por tanto, la tesis que a continuacion se presenta, surge con dos objetivos fundamentales: en primer lugar, con el de proporcionar un modelo de comprension y explicacion del TDAH que, ademas de abordar los deficit de origen cognitivo y conductual, atienda al papel que las emociones desempenan en el comportamiento de las personas que padecen el trastorno, como influyen en su desarrollo y dominio social, asi como que relacion establecen con el resto de procesos neuropsicologicos implicados. Para ello, se llevara a cabo en la Parte Primera del estudio (capitulos 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o y 5o), una revision del concepto, las caracteristicas y los modelos explicativos mas extendidos en torno al origen y desarrollo del trastorno, particularmente en relacion con sus dificultades emocionales y sociales. En la Segunda Parte (capitulos 6o, 7o y 8o), se exponen los resultados de la investigacion llevada a cabo con una amplia muestra de personas con TDAH y sus familias, con el objeto de comprobar y analizar los beneficios de una intervencion especifica Emocional, Social y Cognitiva; disenada para potenciar procesos emocionales de identificacion, expresion y regulacion emocional, y consecuentemente: reducir problemas emocionales, mejorar sus habilidades socio-comunicativas y pragmaticas, potenciar sus habilidades mentalistas, sociales y de resolucion de conflictos. Ademas, se analiza la relacion que otras variables pueden tener sobre dichas competencias: como la edad de los participantes y el tipo de tratamiento recibido; asi como se comparan dichos resultados con los de un grupo control. Para poder llevar a cabo este tratamiento psicoeducativo, se ha elaborado y aplicado un Programa de Intervencion Emocional, Social y Cognitivo, destinado a ninos con TDAH de edades comprendidas entre los 7 y los 14 anos, y a sus padres.",

      "title": "Consciousness in non‐<scp>REM</scp>‐parasomnia episodes",
      "abstract": "Summary Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of non‐rapid eye movement (non‐REM) sleep. Non‐REM parasomnia behaviours have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream‐like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterise the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental (dis)connection associated with behavioural episodes, 35 adult patients with non‐REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in‐depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviours (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterised by delusional thinking to varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni‐ or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%), and variable, but often pronounced, amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (“awake dreaming”). The surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people), or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness, amnesia and sensory disconnection during non‐REM parasomnia episodes is variable and graded. In their full‐fledged expression, non‐REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep‐related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "title": "Resolution of stuttering during ketamine treatment: a case report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Stuttering may include repetition of words in whole or part, difficulty saying words, and elongated pauses in speech. Approximately 5% of children stutter for a period lasting 6 months or more. Most of those children stop stuttering as they approach adulthood, but the condition persists in approximately 1% of adults. The cause of stuttering is unknown. Adults who stutter face substantial burdens in many aspects of their lives. Stutterers may choose not to pursue meaningful employment opportunities, may not be hired for positions they seek, or may be denied promotions or positive performance evaluations. Stuttering can cause physical tension from fear of speaking. Social challenges arise when a person who stutters is seen as less capable or of lower intelligence than fluent speakers. Stuttering causes emotional difficulties through the frustration and embarrassment that disfluent speakers feel. Stutterers may experience a general loss of self-esteem and personal satisfaction in life. Speech therapy is the primary intervention for stuttering. Medications have been investigated as treatments for stuttering, but no medication has been identified that has widespread effectiveness. Case presentation A 60-year-old white non-Hispanic woman who had been a near lifelong stutterer was prescribed ketamine for an unrelated condition and experienced an almost immediate resolution of her stuttering. Conclusions Many possible pharmacological treatments for stuttering have been studied. Some medications appear to be effective in some patients; some appear to be more generally effective but have negative side effects. No reporting in relevant literature has addressed a possible role for ketamine in stuttering treatment. On the basis of this case report, research on the effect of ketamine on stuttering would be useful. Any effective treatment for stuttering would have a significant positive effect on quality of life for persons who stutter.",

      "title": "The Consequences of a Week of Insomnia II: Patients with Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia patients present with a consistent set of complaints that they generally report as secondary to their poor sleep, including increased tension/confusion, decreased vigor, personality disturbance, subjective overestimation of poor sleep, increased body temperature, increased 24-hour whole-body metabolic rate, and longer MSLT latencies. If there is a relationship between the poor sleep and the secondary symptoms, then particularly poor sleep should exacerbate those symptoms. Ten patients with insomnia were identified on the basis of a 2-night screening protocol, then slept in the laboratory for 10 additional nights. On 7 of the nights, the insomnia patients had their wake-after-sleep-onset increased so that their total sleep time was 80% of that on their second screening night, resulting in an average of 254 minutes (of 480 minutes in bed) of sleep. The spectrum of changes seen in these patients with insomnia who had very poor sleep for a week was characteristic of mild partial sleep deprivation, and not consistent with exacerbation of symptoms found in patients with primary insomnia. Specifically, (1) these patients had a reduction as opposed to an increase in the MSLT values, but the MSLT values at the end of the week remained within normal limits; (2) these patients had decreased (as opposed to increased) whole metabolic rate following nights of particularly poor sleep; (3) these patients tended to underestimate (rather than overestimate) their subjective sleep latency while being given particularly poor sleep; and (4) these patients displayed no significant change in body temperature, subjective anxiety, or MMPI scores following particularly poor sleep. It was concluded that the secondary symptoms reported by patients with primary insomnia are probably not related to their poor sleep per se. Data from previous studies that varied physiological arousal were used to support the contention that the secondary symptoms of patients with insomnia, and perhaps the poor sleep itself, occur secondary to central nervous system hyperarousal.",

      "abstract": "Enuresis is defined as the repeated voiding of urine into clothes or bed at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months in a child who is at least 5 years of age. The behavior is not due exclusively to the direct physiologic effect of a substance or a general medical condition. Diurnal enuresis defines wetting, whereas awake and nocturnal enuresis refers to voiding during sleep. Primary enuresis occurs in children who have never been consistently dry through the night, whereas secondary enuresis refers the resumption of wetting after at least 6 months of dryness. Monosymptomatic enuresis has no associated daytime symptoms, and nonmonosymptomatic enuresis, which is more common, often has at least one subtle daytime symptom. Monosymptomatic enuresis is rarely associated with significant organic underlying abnormalities. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic disabling illness characterized by repetitive, ritualistic behaviors over which the patients have little or no control. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between OCD and nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE).In this case-control study, we evaluated 186 children aged 6-17 years old who were visited in the pediatric clinics of Amir Kabir Hospital, Arak, Iran. The control group included 93 healthy children, and the case group included 93 age- and sex-matched children with stage 1-3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Then, the children's behavioral status was evaluated using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale.The difference in compulsion was significant (P = 0.021), whereas the difference in obsession was significant between the two groups (P = 0.013). The most common symptom in CKD children with compulsion was silent repetition of words.Compulsive and obsessive are more common in NMNE versus healthy children. The observed correlation between compulsive-obsessive and NMNE makes psychological counseling mandatory in children with NMNE.",

      "title": "The Nature of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

      "title": "REM Sleep in Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is mainly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, but the characteristic feature is abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena. REM sleep disturbances can manifest as cataplexy (in narcolepsy type 1), sleep paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, abnormal dreams, polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep disruption with sleep-onset REM periods, and fragmented REM sleep. Characterization of REM sleep and related symptoms facilitates the differentiation of narcolepsy from other central hypersomnolence disorders and aids in distinguishing between narcolepsy types 1 and 2. A circuit comprising regions within the brainstem, forebrain, and hypothalamus is involved in generating and regulating REM sleep, which is influenced by changes in monoamines, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides. REM sleep is associated with brainstem functions, including autonomic control, and REM sleep disturbances may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Medications used to treat narcolepsy (and REM-related symptoms of narcolepsy) include stimulants/wake-promoting agents, pitolisant, oxybates, and antidepressants; hypocretin agonists are a potential new class of therapeutics. The role of REM sleep disturbances in narcolepsy remains an area of active research in pathophysiology, symptom management, and treatment. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of REM sleep and its dysfunction in narcolepsy.",

Apart from insomnia, alterations of the organization of sleep and especially a shortening of paradoxical sleep latency, as well as modifications of slow wave sleep, have been reported. The main effect of classical antidepressant drugs is a marked decrease or a complete abolition of paradoxical sleep. However, some antidepressant drugs do not affect paradoxical sleep, and other drugs, devoid of antidepressant properties, depress markedly the production of paradoxical sleep. The investigation of the modifications of sleep in depressive states, as well as of the effect of antidepressant drugs, may contribute to a better understanding of the physiopathology of these diseases.",

It causes a relative lack of breathing and sleeping that bodes disaster for the patient. Alternately breathing and not breathing, the afflicted sleeper struggles to inspire through an obstructed upper airway or, more correctly, an occluded oropharynx. He repeatedly experiences episodic hypoxemia, which, in turn, disrupts his sleep. (This use of the male pronoun is convenient and correct, statistically; OSA is rare in women.) Obstructive sleep apnea is a multisystem disorder involving metabolic, respiratory, and neural abnormalities. The cause of the airway obstruction is multifaceted and includes the following: structural encroachment on the oropharyngeal lumen, subatmospheric intrapharyngeal pressure, and hypotonicity of oropharyngeal muscles. Similarly, secondary disease manifestations appear in multiple systems; respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, and hypersomnolence are characteristic of severe OSA, and this complex is usually referred to",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

In the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, second edition (ICSD-2) (1), a diagnosis of insomnia must confirm both the existence of nocturnal symptoms and a clinically significant impact during the patient's waking state. Nocturnal symptoms include difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, early awakening, and interrupted or nonrestorative sleep. Daytime symptoms include distress about poor nocturnal sleep and impairment in any role function or other aspects of overall well-being. Researchers have traditionally used quantitative criteria to diagnose insomnia, but these criteria have not been standardized. Quantitative criteria for the frequency and duration of total wake time and/or total sleep time have been proposed (2), but these criteria have not been uniformly employed.",

      "title": "Too little or too much nocturnal movements in Parkinson’s disease: A practical guide to managing the unseen",
      "abstract": "Nocturnal and sleep-related motor disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a wide spectrum of manifestations and present a complex clinical picture. Problems can arise due to impaired movement ability (hypokinesias), e.g. nocturnal hypokinesia or early-morning akinesia, or to excessive movement (hyperkinesias), e.g. end-of-the-day dyskinesia, parasomnias, periodic limb movement during sleep and restless legs syndrome. These disorders can have a significant negative impact on the sleep, daytime functional ability, and overall quality of life of individuals with PD and their carers. The debilitating motor issues are often accompanied by a combination of non-motor symptoms, including pain and cramping, which add to the overall burden. Importantly, nocturnal motor disorders encompass a broader timeline than just the period of sleep, often starting in the evening, as well as occurring throughout the night and on awakening, and are not just limited to problems of insomnia or sleep fragmentation. Diagnosis can be challenging as, in many cases, the 'gold standard' assessment method is video polysomnography, which may not be available in all settings. Various validated questionnaires are available to support evaluation, and alternative approaches, using wearable sensors and digital technology, are now being developed to facilitate early diagnosis and monitoring. This review sets out the parameters of what can be considered normal nocturnal movement and describes the clinical manifestations, usual clinical or objective assessment methods, and evidence for optimal management strategies for the common nocturnal motor disorders that neurologists will encounter in people with PD in their clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "In the vast majority of patients with parasomnias, the evaluation can be accomplished in the office setting, based on information from the patients themselves and family members or other observers of the nocturnal events. Parasomnias are episodic sleep disorders that include sleepwalking, night terrors, and nightmares. All three conditions are more prevalent in childhood, when developmental factors appear to be responsible for their occurrence; in the much less frequent cases of a delayed onset or persistence in adulthood, psychopathologic states are often primary in their cause. Based on a number of clinical, physiologic, and etiopathogenetic similarities between sleepwalking and night terrors, these two conditions appear to fall along the same pathophysiologic and therefore nosologic continuum. They are both disorders of impaired arousal, characterized by various degrees of confusion, and they occur early in the night when slow-wave sleep predominates, whereas nightmares may occur at any time of the night, because they are closely associated with REM sleep. Another important issue relating to the assessment of parasomnias is to differentiate between nightmares and night terrors: in addition to the different time of night for their occurrence, nightmares are accompanied by much less anxiety, vocalization, motility, and autonomic discharge. Also, nightmare patients usually have vivid and elaborate recall for the event, whereas patients with night terrors are typically amnesic for their episodes, as are patients who sleepwalk. A mainstay in the management of sleepwalking and night terrors is instructing the patients and their family members to provide for adequate safety measures to prevent accidents that may occur during these events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The present study aim to explore whether brain response to sleep-related picture differs in CID and several sleep types. 55 participants were divided into four groups: 25 Chronic Insomnia Disorder according to International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3 (ICSD-3) criteria (CID; 21 female, age=46.9±12.8), 15 Good Sleepers (GS; 10 female, age=38.4±13.7), 9 Short Sleepers (SS; sleep duration less than 6 hours per day but not have insomnia symptoms; 4 female, age=40.4±12) and 6 Insufficient Sleepers (IS; sleep duration less than 6 hours per weekday and weekend over sleep more than 2 hours; 3 female, age=32.1±16.1). During fMRI, participants completed a sleep-related picture task. To examine group differences in brain response to sleep-related pictures vs. control pictures, one-way ANOVA was conducted. Furthermore, correlation analyses were performed to test associations between neural response and clinical features including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS). CID showed significantly greater PSQI, ISI and DBAS scores than three other groups (p<0.05). Compared with the other groups, CID group showed increased neural response to sleep-related pictures in bilateral insula, right anterior cingulate cortex, left postcentral gyrus, left posterior insula (p<0.001, cluster size=50). Brain response in these regions was positively correlated with PSQI and ISI scores (p<0.05). CID showed increased responses to sleep-related pictures in brain regions have been implicated in attention and emotional regulation. These results suggest that there may be attentional bias or emotional response to sleep-related pictures in CID patients.

A nightmare is an unpleasant or frightening dream that occurs during rapid-eye movement sleep. The content of a dream or nightmare may be very significant. Nightmare can indicate fears or anxieties that the patient is unable to express while awake. Drugs may interfere with sleep patterns. Night terrors are common in children, but uncommon in adults. They occur at a different point of the sleep cycle from nightmares, and are accompanied by considerable autonomic and motor disturbance. Any of the following drugs may contribute to nightmares: alcohol, anticholinergic drugs, caffeine, hypnotics and tricyclic antidepressants.",

In cases of intrapartum asphyxia, the duration of oxygen deprivation may vary and is critical to the ensuing insult to the infant’s vital organs and, especially, to the brain. Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1). Attempts to assign an HIE ‘grade’ may help to correlate early symptoms and signs with the degree and likelihood of long-term sequelae [2], although accurate prognostication of asphyxial brain damage remains difficult.",

No es tampoco un fenomeno unitario ya que engloba diferentes manifestaciones de dificultades lectoras asociadas a distintas disfunciones neuropsicologicas. Entre las hipotesis que se barajan en la literatura cientifica, las mas populares hacen referencia a la existencia de un deficit en el procesamiento fonologico o conciencia fonologica que consiste en una incapacidad para segmentar el flujo del habla en sus constituyentes sonoros. Todavia no se conoce con exactitud el origen de este problema aunque se han planteado dos hipotesis:\nA,- El deficit es producido por una disfuncion en un sistema especifico para el habla.\nB,- El deficit es producido por una deficiencia auditiva mas general caracterizada por una dificultad para discriminar estimulos que cambian rapidamente de frecuencias.\nEsta ultima hipotesis ha sido denominada hipotesis del procesamiento temporal.\nOtro tipo de teorias hacen referencia a la existencia de dificultades en el procesamiento visual tanto a un nivel de procesos basicos, que se encuentran relacionados con la via magnocelular encargada de procesar las imagenes en movimiento durante la lectura, como de procesos superiores asociados al procesamiento ortografico o visuoespecial. En este sentido, el modelo de deficit de Symour (1997) se constituye como un modelo valido y parsimonioso que permite integrar las diferentes hipotesis mencionadas dentro de un modelo cognitivo de la lectura.\nUna de las tecnicas utilizadas en el estudio de la dislexia es la tecnica de potenciales cerebrales relacionados con eventos que consiste en el registro de la actividad cerebral debida a un proceso cognitivos inducidos por la realizacion de una d",

      "title": "Neurobehavioral Consequences of Arousals",
      "abstract": "The neurobehavioral deficits of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are often attributed to the rate of respiratory disturbance or rate of arousals during sleep. However, sleep disordered breathing is also associated with other changes in sleep infrastructure that may account for cumulative waking deficits. This was illustrated in polysomnographic data from 1,521 patients with OSAS where increasing arousal indices were associated with increased duration of stage 1 sleep and concomitant reduction in total sleep time. Similar results have been found in paradigms in which sleep was experimentally fragmented in healthy individuals. It appears that chronic fragmentation of sleep, whether by apneas or acoustic stimuli, leads to cumulative homeostatic pressure for sleep, which may explain a number of phenomenan characteristic of both untreated OSAS patients and experimentally fragmented sleepers: (1) increased arousal threshold, (2) rapid return to sleep after arousal, (3) fewer awakenings over time, (4) increased sleep inertia on awakenings, (5) increased amnesia for arousals, and (6) daytime sleepiness. Elevated homeostatic drive for sleep appears to be a function of both the frequency of arousals within a night and the chronicity of sleep fragmentation across nights, neither of which have been adequately modeled in experimental studies of healthy subjects.",

Patient's main complaints are related to difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep (initial or middle insomnia, respectively) and poor quality of sleep. Early awakening or terminal insomnia is most described in the depressive conditions. Hypersomnia may be the main symptom in some depressive disorders, as seasonal depression, depression with atypical features or depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. Polysomnographic evaluation shows, in general, a significative reduction in the efficiency and total time of sleep, in detriment to the amount of slow wave sleep. The reduction of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency is mainly described for the depression, but has also been reported in other psychiatric disorders.",

Weekly daytime wetting occurs in 5% of children, most of whom (80%) also wet the bed. Bedwetting can have a considerable impact on children and families, affecting a child's self-esteem and interpersonal relationships, and his or her performance at school. Primary nocturnal enuresis (never consistently dry at night) should be distinguished from secondary nocturnal enuresis (previously dry for at least 6 months). Important risk factors for primary nocturnal enuresis include family history, nocturnal polyuria, impaired sleep arousal and bladder dysfunction. Secondary nocturnal enuresis is more likely to be caused by factors such as urinary tract infections, diabetes mellitus and emotional stress. The treatment for monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting with no daytime symptoms) is an alarm device, with desmopressin as second-line therapy. Treatment for non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting with daytime symptoms--urgency and frequency, with or without incontinence) should initially focus on the daytime symptoms.Bedwetting without daytime symptoms, the most common toileting problem, can be effectively treated with an alarm device.",

No medications have been shown to have a consistent therapeutic benefit. Delirium is a form of brain dysfunction characterized by the acute onset of fluctuating mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. These features are also seen in states of acute sleep deprivation. It is believed that the state of delirium contributes to disrupted sleep just as sleep deprivation is considered a modifiable risk factor for delirium. Improving sleep conditions and other nonpharmacologic interventions to promote sleep may be an underused approach to preventing and treating delirium in critical illness.",

Symptoms commenced in adolescence or early adult life in most patients, and remissions were uncommon. Narcolepsy occurred several times each day, often in unusual circumstances and sometimes with little warning. The mean total sleep time of narcoleptics was a little over 9 hours in each 24 hour period, as compared with under 8 in normal subjects. Cataplexy occurred in 93 patients, most commonly when subjects were tired. Attacks were similar in nature to physiological weakness with laughter, although other sudden sensory or emotional stimuli did not cause paralysis of voluntary movement nor loss of muscle tone in normal subjects. Half these patients had frequent dreams before the onset of proper sleep, and 62 had sleep paralysis. This was often frightening, with feelings of suffocation, accompanied by dreams, and of uncertain length. A minority of patients with narcolepsy had muscle aches and jerks before sleep, double vision or loss of focus during cataplexy, went sleep-walking by day, and had daytime hallucinations. Amphetamines had been given to 71 patients for periods of up to 33 years with adequate, but rarely complete, control of narcolepsy. Side effects were common and almost half these patients became tolerant, needing higher dosage to control symptoms. Three patients had a cerebrovascular accident whilst taking amphetamines. Imipramine or clomipramine had ben given in combination with amphetamines to 33 patients for periods of up to 6 years with considerable improvement in both cataplexy and sleep paralysis, and few side effects. Sustained or paroxysmal hypertension as a result of amphetamines or combined treatment did not occur.",

      "abstract": "Even in non-sleep-deprived persons, sleepiness occurs at two particular periods of the day, i.e., during the night at the time of normal sleep and in the early afternoon, at the time of the siesta in certain cultures. This can be shown by measuring the physiological tendency to sleep as the latency to sleep in brief naps (Richardson, et al, 1982). Increases in sleepiness can result from sleep deprivation (inadequate sleep) or from sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. Subjects who are excessively sleepy, from whatever cause, have performance lapses and slowed reaction times and an accelerated loss of attentional vigilance (Dinges, 1992). They, moreover will exhibit the phenomenon of microsleeps, i.e., sleepy subjects may fall asleep in an unpredictable fashion and be temporarily unaware of their surroundings. These behavioral changes that occur in sleepy individuals can have important consequences. The consequences will depend on the environment that the subject is in. Perhaps the most dangerous situation is while driving. Crashes occur in individuals who fall asleep at the wheel. Such crashes can be serious with resulting fatalities (Parsons, 1986). That this occurs has been known for some time (for review of earlier work in this area, see Shinar, 1978). The goal of the study described in this report was to investigate, in detail, the characteristics of accidents attributed on the police report to the driver having fallen asleep. The study was a retrospective analysis of data from the state of North Carolina. We analyzed data for the years 1990 to 1992, inclusive. The data are maintained in the data base at the Highway Safety Research Center (HSRC), University of North Carolina. Language: en",

      "title": "Nocturia. A rarely recognized symptom of sleep apnea and other occult sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "Nocturia, awakening from sleep to urinate, is a common symptom in a variety of medical disorders and in the elderly. Awakening from sleep as a result of nocturia is thought to be secondary to a sensation of urinary urgency resulting from an overextended bladder. Nocturia-related awakenings cause significant sleep disruption and fatigue in elderly patients and are correlated with an increased number of falls at night. Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea are also common in the elderly and are frequently the source of awakenings from sleep. The high incidence of both nocturia and sleep disorders in the elderly and other groups of patients suggests that sleep disorders may be the source of some awakenings from sleep usually attributed by patients to nocturia. Nocturia secondary to sleep disorders would be causatively different from nocturia secondary to pressure to urinate in common medical disorders and would require different diagnostic procedures and treatment.To determine the frequency of nocturia as a symptom of primary sleep disorders.Eighty consecutive patients, 27 women and 53 men with a mean (+/-SD) age of 58.7+/-14.1 years, undergoing polysomnography (sleep study or PSG) for the evaluation of a suspected sleep disorder and who met the sole criteria of awakening from sleep at least once and urinating voluntarily. Each patient had either a standard PSG recording or a PSG with administration of nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Immediately after each episode of nocturia during the PSG, patients were questioned about the reason they believed they had awakened. The PSG record immediately before awakening from sleep was then reviewed for potential causes of awakening. Patients were also asked on final morning awakening to fill in a questionnaire regarding their awakenings during the prior night. Patient reports were compared with the PSG to determine the accuracy of subjective reports.Patients awakened from sleep and voluntarily urinated a mean (+/- of 1.5+/-0.75 times per night for a total of 121 awakenings for the group. The majority (79.3%) of these awakenings from sleep were found to be directly secondary to sleep apnea, snoring or periodic leg movements in sleep. Patients correctly identified the source of their awakening from sleep on only five(4.9%) occasions and only once was sleep apnea correctly cited by a patient as a source of awakening during the night.Most awakenings from sleep attributed by our patients to pressure to urinate were instead a result of sleep disorders, particularly sleep apnea. The fact that patients do urinate once awake likely contributed to faulty post hoc reasoning and might have limited further inquiry by patients and their physicians in clinical settings into the actual sources of awakening from sleep. Even in those patients with well-known medical reasons for noctruria, Sleep disorders were still found to be the source of almost all awakenings from sleep. Patients were extremely poor judges of the reasons they awoke from sleep. The diagnosis of a sleep disorder should be seriously considered whenever a patient reports frequent awakenings from sleep to urinate.",

      "abstract": "Headache pain impacts most of the population at some point in life, at an enormous cost to day-to-day functioning. Determination of the variables that are associated with prevalence and severity of headaches has been inconsistent. One area that deserves more attention is the relationship between headaches and sleep. For instance, several sleep parameters may precipitate or exacerbate headaches, but previous research often used inconsistent and limited assessments of both headaches and sleep, making results difficult to interpret and compare. The current study seeks to extend previous research by using more comprehensive and empirically validated assessment techniques to study the relationship between sleep and headaches in a healthy sample. Greater self-reported sleep quality is related to lower headache frequency and severity, and lower self-reported sleep quality is characteristic of individuals having migraine-type headaches. Greater sleep efficiency is related to lower headache severity and shorter headache duration. Greater sleep onset latency is related to longer headache duration and greater headache severity. Greater number of nighttime awakenings is related to greater headache severity and is characteristic of individuals having a diagnosable headache disorder (either tension-type or migraine-type). Stress appeared to be a partial mediator between self-reported sleep quality and headache severity. Further experimental studies may clarify causality between sleep and headache.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are an integral feature of depressive disorders. Like the disorders themselves, the sleep disturbances associated with depression are heterogeneous, ranging from hypersomnia to marked difficulties maintaining sleep. These difficulties are to some extent age dependent and reflect abnormalities of central nervous system arousal. Moreover, the sleep disturbances associated with depression have both reversible, or state-dependent, and more persistent trait-like characteristics. Polysomnographic recordings can be used to document sleep maintenance difficulties, and they often also reveal reduced slow wave sleep, an early onset of the first episode of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and increased phasic REM sleep. A deficit of serotonergic neurotransmission, a relative increase in pontine cholinergic activity, and, perhaps, an excess of noradrenergic and corticotropin-releasing hormone activity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the sleep disturbances of more severe depressive disorders. Antidepressant medications have class- and compound-specific effects on polysomnographic profiles. Unlike other antidepressants, bupropion may increase or intensify REM sleep. While no single effect of antidepressants on sleep neurophysiology is necessary or sufficient for treatment efficacy, differences in drug effects may provide important clues to selection of specific medications for particular patients.",

      "abstract": "Le sommeil joue un role majeur dans les processus de consolidation des apprentissages. Les performances des sujets lors de la restitution de tests de memoire sont meilleures lorsque les phases d'apprentissage et de restitution sont separees par une periode de sommeil plutot que par une periode d'eveil. Les effets du sommeil sur ces processus de consolidation ont largement ete etudies chez l'adulte, notamment a l'aide de protocoles de privation de sommeil specifiques. Neanmoins, l'utilisation de ces protocoles de privation de sommeil est impossible chez les enfants pour des raisons d'ethique. Nos connaissances actuelles relatives aux effets du sommeil sur les processus de consolidation des apprentissages dependants du sommeil sont donc tres limitees chez l'enfant. Les troubles du sommeil touchent une proportion non negligeable des enfants et ont des repercussions diurnes importantes, notamment au niveau academique. De maniere surprenante, bien que la majorite des enfants ayant des troubles du sommeil soit en echec scolaire, l'impact de ces troubles du sommeil sur les processus de consolidation des apprentissages dependants du sommeil a tres rarement ete evalue. L'objectif de ce projet de these etait donc d'evaluer l'impact des troubles du sommeil sur ces processus de consolidation. Pour atteindre cet objectif, nous avons selectionne 3 pathologies presentant des atteintes specifiques du sommeil : la narcolepsie, le syndrome d'apnees obstructives du sommeil (SAOS) et l'epilepsie benigne de l'enfant a pointes centro-temporales (EPCT). Nous avons soumis ces groupes d'enfants ainsi qu'un groupe d'enfants controles apparies en âge et en sexe a des tests de consolidation mnesique dont la phase d'apprentissage etait realisee le soir avant le coucher et la phase de restitution le matin apres la nuit post-apprentissage. Afin d'avoir la vision la plus complete possible de l'impact des troubles du sommeil sur les processus de consolidation des apprentissages, ces tests de consolidation mnesique impliquaient des apprentissages de nature declarative (tâches verbale, visuo-spatiale et emotionnelle) et non-declarative (tâche procedurale). Nous avons egalement mesure les capacites attentionnelles des enfants avant l'apprentissage et avant la restitution des tests de consolidation mnesique. Les resultats que nous avons obtenus semblent indiquer que la narcolepsie, le SAOS et l'EPCT auraient un impact negatif sur les processus de consolidation des apprentissages visuo-spatiaux dependants du sommeil. En revanche, ces 3 pathologies ne semblent pas avoir d'influence sur ces processus dans le cadre des apprentissages verbal, emotionnel et procedural. Ces resultats suggerent donc que les aspects concernant la consolidation nocturne des apprentissages devraient etre integres dans les evaluations neuropsychologiques rentrant en compte dans le diagnostic des enfants porteurs de ces pathologies. De plus, les suivis pedagogique et reeducatif de ces enfants devraient etre reconsideres",

Depression is a state of mental disorder characterized by three main symptoms and seven additional symptoms. Diabetes Mellitus Type-1 (T1DM) is a systemic disorder caused by impaired glucose metabolism, which is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia. Depression is common in patients with T1DM. In this case report, a 13-year-old girl was consulted because she looks sad. A feeling of sadness has been felt for 3 months and has been getting worse since a week ago, which was initially because of T1DM. Patients usually work at home and carry out daily activities as usual. Currently, the patient has no desire and gets tired easily, especially when doing usual activities, thinking the pain will get worse and thinking that she can't recover. Complaints are felt throughout the day and worsen at night, especially before bed or when alone. The patient feels that she is useless and his future is bleak. During pregnancy, the patient's mother routinely checks with the midwife and gets complete immunizations. The patient was born vaginally and cried spontaneously.

      "title": "Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic criteria and treatment of insomnia are reviewed.Insomnia is most often described as a subjective complaint of poor sleep quality or quantity despite adequate time for sleep, resulting in daytime fatigue, irritability, and decreased concentration. Insomnia is classified as idiopathic or comorbid. Comorbid insomnias are associated with psychiatric disorders, medical disorders, substance abuse, and specific sleep disorders. Idiopathic insomnia is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion. A wide array of terminology exists for defining the duration of insomnia symptoms, which may add to the confusion regarding insomnia classification. Acute insomnia refers to sleep problems lasting from one night to a few weeks, whereas chronic insomnia refers to sleep problems lasting at least three nights weekly for at least one month. Diagnostic tools for identifying insomnia are multifactorial. Nonpharmacologic interventions for insomnia include sleep-hygiene education, stimulus-control therapy, relaxation therapy, and sleep-restriction therapy. The most effective pharmacologic therapies for insomnia are benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, melatonin-receptor agonists, and antidepressants. Choice of a specific agent should be based on patient-specific factors, including age, proposed length of treatment, primary sleep complaint, history of drug or alcohol abuse, and cost.Many treatment options are available for patients with insomnia. Behavioral therapies should be initiated as first-line treatment in most patients. For patients who require the addition of pharmacologic therapy, the drugs with the most evidence for benefit include benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, melatonin-receptor agonists, and antidepressants. Selection of a specific agent must take into account numerous patient-specific factors.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

The REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with parkinsonian syndromes and other neurodegenerative disorders. Restless legs syndrome occurs with myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nThe syndrome of sleep apnea interacts with neurologic disorders in several ways. 1) Many patients with neurologic disorders have coexisting sleep apnea simply because obstructive sleep apnea is so common.

      "title": "Sleep less and bite more: Sleep disorders associated with occlusal loads during sleep",
      "abstract": "Occlusal overload during sleep is a significant clinical issue that has negative impacts on the maintenance of teeth and the longevity of dental prostheses. Sleep is usually viewed as an 'out-of-functional' mode for masticatory muscles. However, orodental structures and prostheses are not free from occlusal loads during sleep since masticatory muscles can be activated at a low level within normal sleep continuity. Thus, an increase in masticatory muscle contractions, by whatever the cause, can be associated with a risk of increased occlusal loads during sleep. Among such conditions, sleep bruxism (SB) is a type of sleep-related movement disorders with potential load challenge to the tooth and orofacial structures. Patients with SB usually report frequent tooth grinding noises during sleep and there is a consecutive increase in number and strength of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA). Other types of masticatory muscle contractions can be non-specifically activated during sleep, such as brief contractions with tooth tapping, sleep talking, non-rhythmic contractions related to non-specific body movements, etc.; these occur more frequently in sleep disorders. Studies have shown that clinical signs and symptoms of SB can be found in patients with sleep disorders. In addition, sleep becomes compromised with aging process, and a prevalence of most sleep disorders is high in the elderly populations, in which prosthodontic rehabilitations are more required. Therefore, the recognition and understanding of the role of sleep disorders can provide a comprehensive vision for prosthodontic rehabilitations when prosthodontists manage complex orodental cases needing interdisciplinary collaborations between dentistry and sleep medicine.",

      "abstract": "Three major components have been repeatedly implicated for the origin(s) of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): system, minor sickness and surroundings. All these factors also frame infant temperament, and therefore it seems logical to suppose that the babies who either succumb to or are at risk of SIDS may present with certain behavioural features. The infants who have died of SIDS moved less when lying awake in the crib, during feeding and during nail cutting; less often turned their head away and looked for their mother when held by a new person; were more frequently reported to show an extreme response (either almost never protested or almost always objected) when approached by someone other than main caregiver; and exhibited extreme behavioural patterns when the infant’s vocalising on waking up was studied. The infants who died of SIDS had lower activity scores. An unfavourable microenvironment can increase the risk of SIDS, and the babies facing less developmental stimulation had a more negative mood and were less distractible; less organised infants presented with a more negative mood, less distractible behaviour, lower rhythmicity, lower persistence and lower adaptability. The infants born to smoking mothers who are at risk of SIDS had more intensive reactions. The low‐birth‐weight infants who are at high risk of SIDS were more withdrawing and less adaptable. Infant–parent(s) bed sharing may increase the risk of SIDS, and solitary sleeping infants had a more positive mood and were more persistent. Use of a pacifier may be protective against SIDS, and pacifier users presented with higher rhythmicity. Prone sleep is known to increase the risk of SIDS, and the lowest persistence was a feature of those babies who were usually put to sleep supine and found prone. Infants who snored and/or had noisy breathing in sleep were characterised by more negative mood. Infants with signs of repetitive regurgitation were less distractible.",

      "title": "Inadequate Sleep in Children and Adolescents",
      "abstract": "This chapter discusses considerable empirical evidence that relates inadequate or disturbed sleep in children and adolescents to a variety of impairments and potential risks. It describes some research on experimental sleep restriction in children but most of these studies fall far short of common deprivation paradigms in animals or even adult humans. The chapter describes many of the studies that have obtained usual sleep duration variables from self-report or home measurement with actigraphy with the expectation that lower sleep durations will be linked to deficits in functioning. Historically, a variety of strategies have been used to assess children and adolescents' sleep/wake patterns, ranging from self- or parent report instruments to polysomnography. Available time to sleep for infants, children, and adults is influenced by a range of environmental and societal factors. Children with inadequate sleep are often diagnosed with behavioral and mental health difficulties. Inadequate sleep may also be associated with sleep disorders in adolescents.",

      "title": "The role of sleep in neuromuscular disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep represents a major frontier both in clinical myology and as a new possibility for delivering treatment to neuromuscular patients since various neuromuscular cases present a variable degree of disordered sleep and such conditions should be diagnosed and prevented, i.e., sleep apnea and hypoxemia. These sleep disorders are present in dystrophinopathies and in various types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD). Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is found in patients affected by spastic paraparesis or cerebellar ataxia but is rather common in both myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2, and the correction of sleep disorders is therefore important to improve their daily quality of life (QoL) and consequent daily functioning. Other types of sleep dysfunction such as insomnia, a reduction in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, loss of normal REM, or sleep-disordered breathing are found in other disorders including myasthenia, ataxias, spastic paraparesis, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and neurogenic disorders, including polyneuropathies, and need appropriate treatment. Research done on this topic aims to incorporate a variety of nuances in metabolic disorders such as those in late-onset Pompe disease and are such as those in late-onset Pompe disease who are susceptible to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The overarching goal is to explore both the diagnosis and methodology of sleep-related problems in both genetic and acquired neuromuscular disorders. We also review the type of available treatment opportunities utilized to improve neuromuscular patients’ QoL.",

They may present as a clinical feature or symptom of another co-occurring disorder or may represent a sleep–wake disorder. There are multiple types of sleep–wake disorders, which may involve, for example, trouble sleeping at night (insomnia), problems with breathing during sleep (sleep apnea), or abnormal events during sleep (nightmares). This chapter focuses on the assessment of insomnia disorder in adults. It begins with a review of the nature of the disorder, which is followed by a review of clinical assessment instruments designed for the assessment purposes of (a) diagnosis, (b) case conceptualization and treatment planning, and (c) treatment monitoring and evaluation. Recommendations are included for instruments with the greatest scientific support and for assessing insomnia disorder in a clinically sensitive manner.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is defined as difficulty falling or remaining asleep with associated daytime consequences. It is among the most common clinical complaints in the general adult population. The prevalence is significantly higher in people with psychiatric disorders. Insomnia in psychiatric patients may be affected by particular disorders, the illness severity, and the treatment approaches. Mood and anxiety disorders are especially likely to be comorbid with insomnia; however, many other psychiatric disorders increase the probability of sleep disturbances. Insomnia frequently is the first symptom heralding an episode of depression, and it may continue as a residual symptom following the resolution of the mood disturbance. Many different sedating substances and medications have been used with the intention of improving sleep. The insomnia treatment medications currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration comprise a variety of benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics and a single selective melatonin receptor agonist. The prescribing guidelines of the recently approved medications have no implied limitation on their duration of use and specify whether they are indicated for sleep onset and maintenance. There are significant safety concerns or inadequate efficacy evidence for the treatment of insomnia with many alternative pharmacologic strategies, including herbal preparations, over-the-counter antihistamines, and the off-label use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Advances in understanding the regulation of the sleep–wake cycle now are leading to new pharmacologic targets to treat insomnia and related sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Motor neurone disease is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative condition which causes progressive weakness, with normal sensation. It can occur at any age but is more frequent with increasing age. Key clinical presentations include bulbar (slurred or difficult speech, problems swallowing, tongue fasciculation), limb (typically in one limb with weakness and muscle wasting), respiratory (breathlessness, chest muscle fasciculation) and cognitive features (behavioural change, emotional lability, features of frontotemporal dementia). Although survival is typically three to five years from symptom onset, there is significant individual variation. Rarely, survival may be 20 years or longer. Favourable features include a limb rather than a bulbar presentation, preserved weight and respiratory function, younger age of onset and longer time from fist symptom to diagnosis. The patient should be linked to a multidisciplinary team able to provide support from the start with a designated individual as the point of contact, with regular, coordinated assessments, as the patient's needs change and their condition progresses. Gastrostomy is an important supportive intervention which maximizes nutrition, and minimizes aspiration and chest infection. Adequate nutrition and hydration is key to maximizing health and survival. It is possible for a patient to control a computer and speech by eye. movement alone. An important consideration is voice banking where the patient may store their voice before there is difficulty with speech so that it can be used at a later stage if they need a communication aid. Impaired cough and retention of respiratory secretions is frequent in the later stages, and may be managed with physiotherapy. The patient should be referred for expert respiratory assessment if needed.",

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "abstract": "The topics in this chapter are as follows: Bedwetting (Nocturnal enuresis = NE), Frequent urination, Dysuria and Polyuria. Bedwetting Misdiagnosis is due to failing to differentiate between monosymptomatic and complicated NE, and failing to recognize other causes of nocturnal enuresis, blood in urine, dysuria, and polyuria. Bedwetting presents either in isolation (monosymptomatic enuresis = MSE) or in association with urinary tract infection (UTI), vulvovaginitis, daytime incontinence, urge, hesitancy, straining symptoms of urination, postvoid dribbling or dysfunctional voiding (non-monosymptomatic enuresis = NMSE). NE is divided into primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) and secondary nocturnal enuresis (SNE) (restarting bedwetting after a previous dry period >6 months) in 20% of children. The chapter discusses diagnostic criteria of monosymptomatic NE and differentiating it from other conditions causing nocturnal enuresis including compulsive drinking, type 1 diabetes and diabetes insipidus. Blood in urine Misdiagnosis is due to failing to differentiate blood from other blood-appearing substances in the urine, failing to recognize pathologies causing blood in urine in neonates, and in older children. When a child presents with blood in urine, doctors should determine that it is actually haematuria? Red staining of the nappy can be due to either true blood with RBCs or urates. Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn should be excluded. Nephrocalcinosis is not uncommon in premature babies and it can be seen in up to 40 days of life. The detection of proteinuria in association with haematuria is very suggestive of renal origin of the haematuria such as glomerulonephritis. Pathologies causing haematuria in older children include post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which is the most common cause of gross haematuria worldwide. Other topics discussed include urinary tract infection; renal stones, Henoch–Schönlein purpura, renal tumour. Nephroblastoma is the most common urological malignancy in children. Schistosomiasis occurs in many countries, e.g. Egypt. Frequent urination Misdiagnosis is due to failing to establish characteristics of frequent urination and differentiating it from continuous urination and polyuria. The term indicates frequent urination more than 7–8 times a day in older children, The condition needs to be differentiated from continuous dribbling due to posterior urethral valve obstruction in boys, and ectopic ureter in girls. Diagnostic criteria of both conditions are discussed. Dysuria Misdiagnosis is due to failing to recognize that dysuria can exist in infancy, failing to establish common underlying causes of painful urination Dysuria in infancy: Painful urination may occur due to urethritis caused by infection, as idiopathic urethritis, hypercalciuria, or part of Reiter's syndrome (associated with conjunctivitis, polyarthritis), or due to nappy dermatitis affecting the foreskin of the penis. Underlying causes of dysuria in older children are discussed. Urinary incontinence Misdiagnosis is due to failing to consider basic knowledge on urinary incontinence, and failing to establish important secondary causes of urinary incontinence. Basic knowledge of urinary incontinence and their underlying causes of urinary are discussed. Labial fusion is another cause and is common affecting about 3% of pre-pubertal girls Polyuria Misdiagnosis is due to failing to define the diagnosis of polyuria, to differentiate the main causes of polyuria, including diabetes, compulsive drinking, diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis and hypercalcaemia. Polyuria in children results from either a water or solute diuresis. Polydipsia indicates excessive water intake, which is defined in this section. Diagnostic criteria of diabetes type 1 and diabetes insipidus (DI) are discussed. The most important differential diagnosis is between compulsive drinking and DI. Diagnostic criteria of compulsive drinking and renal tubular acidosis are provided. Urinary Retention/inability to pass urine Misdiagnosis is due to failing to distinguish oliguria and anuria from urine retention, and not differentiating the main causes of urine retention. Urine retention indicates an inability to empty the bladder for >12 h with a normal or increased urine volume, or a palpable distended bladder. Causes include bladder neck or urethral obstruction. Oliguria in infants is a urine output of <0.5 mL/kg/h per 24 h. In older children and adults oliguria is <400/day. This quantity (usually resulting from dehydration in children) is insufficient to excrete the daily osmolar load. Causes of reduced urine output or retention in neonates and in older children are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia has been linked to a variety of contributing variables, including as psychological training, genetic predispositions, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes, and cognitive and physiological arousal. The hyper-arousal theory of insomnia postulates that sleep disturbances are caused by an increase in physiological arousal based on the discovery of high physiological arousal, which may be connected to these people's active stress system. Sometimes, sleep issues including difficulties getting asleep, difficulty remaining asleep, or having poor-quality sleep are referred to as insomnia. Insomnia can be brought on by a variety of things, including the use of psychoactive drugs, caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, and cocaine; hormonal changes, such as menstruation and menopause; stressful life events, like the birth of a child and bereavement; disruptions of the circadian rhythm, like shift work and jet lag; some neurological disorders; and medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis. Everything in the universe vibrates at a specific frequency, and when we are in a state of natural resonance, we are in perfect health. But if a bodily component begins to vibrate at the incorrect frequency, the energy becomes trapped, and illness appears. In order to release the repressed energy and return resonance to its natural level, chanting can therefore be employed to affect a therapy.",

      "title": "Childhood Hypersomnia and Sleep Apnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Natural sleep pattern and its physiology in childhood are much different from those in adulthood. Several aspects of clinical evaluation for sleepiness in childhood are more difficult than in adulthood. These difficulties are due to several factors. First, excessive sleepiness in childhood do not always develop functional impairments. Second, objective test such as MSLT may not be reliable since it is hard to be certain that the child understand instructions. Third, sleepiness in children is often obscured by irritability. paradoxical hyperactivity, or behavioral disturbances. Anseguently, careful clinical evaluation is needed for the sleepy children. Usual causes of sleepiness in children are the disorders that induce insufficient sleep such as sleep apnea syndrome, schedule disorder, underlying medical and psychiatric disorder, and so forth. After excluding such factors, we can diagnose the hypersomnic disorders such as narcolepsy, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and idiopathic central nervous system hypersomnia. Among the variety of those causes of sleepiness, I reviewed the clinical difference of narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in childhood compared with in adulthood. Recognition of the childhood narcolepsy is difficult because even severely sleepy children often do not develop pathognomic cataplexy and associated REM phenomena until much later. Since childhood narcolepsy give srise to many psychological, academical problem. Practicers should be concerned about these aspects. Childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is different from adult obstructive sleep apnea syndrome too. Several aspects such as pathophysiology. clinical feature, diagnostic criteria, complication, management, and prognosis differ from those in the adult syndrome. An important feature of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is the variety of severe complications such as behavioral disorders, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular symptoms, developmental delay, and ever death. Fortunately, surgical interventions like adenotosillectomy or UPPP are more effective for Childhood OSA than adult form. CPAP is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated treatment modality too. So if early detection and proper management of childhood OSA were done, the severe complication would be prevented or ever cured.",

Dalam penelitian ini peneliti menggunakan teknik\r\nobservasi non partisipan, yaitu peneliti secara pasif tidak terlibat langsung dalam\r\naktifitas yang sedang berlangsung dan terjadi sambil mencatat tingkah laku di\r\nsekitarnya. Peneliti juga menggunakan teknik wawancara yang bersifat\r\nsemiterstruktur yaitu wawancara dilakukan secara terbuka tetapi tetap\r\nberpedoman pada pertanyaan-pertanyaan tertulis.\r\nBerdasarkan keseluruhan hasil dan pembahasan dalam penelitian yang\r\ndiperoleh dalam penelitian studi kasus ini maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa, jenis\r\ninsomnia yang dialami subjek termasuk insomnia kronis (cronic insomnia). Bila\r\nsubjek sudah sama sekali tidak bisa tidur (dalam dua puluh empat jam subjek\r\ntidak tidur), subjek langsung meminum obat tidur yang diperjualbelikan secara\r\nbebas. Gejala-gejala insomnia yang dialami subjek antara lain subjek mengalami\r\nkesulitan untuk memulai tidur. AR harus membuat dirinya merasa lelah terlebih\r\ndulu agar dapat tidur, jika tetap tidak dapat tidur maka AR akan memaksakan\r\nmemejamkan mata agar dapat tidur, sedangkan NM harus menutup matanya\r\ndengan kain agar dapat tertidur. Gejala lain adalah kedua subjek merasa lesu dan\r\npusing saat bangun tidur dan susah berkonsentrasi saat melakukan pekerjaan.\r\nFaktor penyebab yang dialami subjek sehingga dapat menyebabkan\r\ninsomnia yaitu yang pertama karena permasalahan yang timbul saat penyusunan\r\nskripsi, yang kedua yaitu karena tuntutan orangtua yang menginginkan agar\r\nsubjek dapat menyelesaikan kuliahnya dengan cepat, dan mendapatkan gelar\r\nsarjana. Adapun faktor yang ketiga yaitu karena waktu perkuliahan yang sudah\r\nmendekati batas. Simpulan keempat, Gangguan insomnia memberikan dampak\r\nnegatif dalam kehidupan subjek. Pertama, akan mengurangi daya tahan tubuh\r\nsehingga berpeluang terhadap munculnya penyakit. Kedua, susah tidur akan\r\nberpengaruh terhadap stabilitas emosi sehingga mempengaruhi aktivitas\r\nkehidupan sehari-hari. Subjek mangalami penurunan tingkat motivasi,\r\nkonsentrasi, ketelitian, kreativitas, dan produktivitas kerja. Dari penelitian yang\r\ntelah dilakukan maka peneliti dapat memberikan saran pada subjek untuk\r\nmengurangi dan menghilangkan segala kekhawatiran dan kecemasan dengan\r\nbersikap optimis dan merilekskan diri saat melakukan pekerjaan, terutama saat\r\nakan tidur.\r\nSaran kedua adalah olahraga pada sore hari (enam jam sebelum tidur).\r\nMelakukan peregangan otot atau jalan kaki secukupnya selama duapuluh menit.\r\nHal ini akan meningkatkan metabolisme dan suhu badan, lalu akan menurun\r\nsekitar enam jam kemudian yang berefek pada tidur yang nyenyak. Ketiga,\r\nMengurangi rokok dan tidak merokok beberapa jam sebelum tidur karena rokok\r\nmengandung nikotin yang dapat meningkatkan semangat karena berefek sebagai\r\nneurostimulan. Selain itu rokok dapat membahayakan kesehatan diri sendiri dan\r\norang lain di sekitarnya, karena orang lain yang tidak merokok tetapi terkena asap\r\nrokok juga akan mengalami gangguan kesehatan dengan resiko yang sama.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep medicine is an increasingly important specialty as the adverse health consequences of disturbed sleep are recognised by patients and physicians, and the current classification of sleep disorders, as recognised by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), is summarised. Two primary sleep disorders, narcolepsy with cataplexy and the disorders of arousal, a symptomatic cluster that includes sleepwalking, confusional arousal and sleep terrors, are reviewed in greater detail. Both disorders can be summarised as being caused by inappropriate switching between the states of vigilance, although they are very different in age of onset, severity and impact on health. In narcolepsy the boundary between sleep and wakefulness is uncontrolled but in the disorders of arousal the boundary between states of sleep is affected. These two disorders also have a genetic predisposition suggesting that advances in knowledge of the relevant mutations could eventually translate into better understanding of the possible mechanisms and hence lead to improved treatments. Key Concepts: The disorders of sleep are primary, for example as a result of pathology in the mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness, or secondary, for example resulting from a medical condition. Apnoea, interruptions of breathing lasting longer than 10 s that result in arousal from sleep, is the principal presenting condition at sleep clinics. Polysomnography is used to record physiological parameters such as respiration rate, heart rate and blood oxygen level simultaneously with data allowing the stage of sleep or wakefulness to be defined. Basic research into the neurophysiology, molecular genetics and neurochemistry of sleep and wakefulness has been critical for understanding the causes of many sleep disorders. The classification of sleep disorders is continuously evolving and being refined as new disorders are recognised in the clinic and neurophysiological and neurochemical pathologies are better understood.",

      "title": "The biological basis of injury and neuroprotection in the fetal and neonatal brain",
      "abstract": "Abstract A compromised intrauterine environment that delivers low levels of oxygen and/or nutrients, or is infected or inflammatory, can result in fetal brain injury, abnormal brain development and in cases of chronic compromise, intrauterine growth restriction. Preterm birth can also be associated with injury to the developing brain and affect the normal trajectory of brain growth. This review will focus on the effects that episodes of perinatal hypoxia (acute, chronic, associated with inflammation or as an antecedent of preterm birth) can have on the developing brain. In animal models of these conditions we have found that relatively brief (acute) periods of fetal hypoxemia can have significant effects on the fetal brain, for example death of susceptible neuronal populations (cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex) and cerebral white matter damage. Chronic placental insufficiency which includes fetal hypoxemia, nutrient restriction and altered endocrine status can result in fetal growth restriction and long‐term deficits in neural connectivity in addition to altered postnatal function, for example in the auditory and visual systems. Maternal/fetal inflammation can result in fetal brain damage, particularly but not exclusively in the white matter; injury is more pronounced when associated with fetal hypoxemia. In the baboon, in which the normal trajectory of growth is affected by preterm birth, there is a direct correlation between a higher flux in oxygen saturation and a greater extent of neuropathological damage. Currently, the only established therapy for neonatal encephalopathy in full term neonates is moderate hypothermia although this only offers some protection to moderately but not severely affected brains. There is no accepted therapy for injured preterm brains. Consequently the search for more efficacious treatments continues; we discuss neuroprotective agents (erythropoietin, N‐acetyl cysteine, melatonin, creatine, neurosteroids) which we have trialed in appropriate animal models. The possibility of combining hypothermia with such agents or growth factors is now being considered. A deeper understanding of causal pathways in brain injury is essential for the development of efficacious strategies for neuroprotection.",

      "title": "A Frequent Factor in the Origins of Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Anxiety in the Third Year of Life",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Primary nocturnal enuresis is not always due to the same cause and often several factors contribute. As the child grows older, the factor mainly responsible for his enuresis usually changes. The various current explanations appear to apply only to minority groups. Primary nocturnal enuresis sometimes causes anxiety but it is not evidence of underlying psychological disorder. The second, third and fourth years are a period in which acquisition of nocturnal bladder control is frequent and they are succeeded by a period of several years in which acquisition is rare. These are the characters of what ethologists call a ‘sensitive learning period’. Evidence is set out that anxiety‐provoking episodes during the third year of life are more frequent in the history of children who later have primary nocturnal enuresis than of children who are dry. It is suggested that anxiety in the third year is frequently the major factor causing children's failure to have learnt nocturnal bladder control before they enter the period of difficult learning. The bedwetting persists as ‘primary’ enuresis; the anxiety is usually transient. As onset enuresis is accepted as due to anxiety, the hypothesis that anxiety during the sensitive learning period for the skill of nocturnal bladder control is a frequent factor in the origins of primary nocturnal enures's is a unifying and parsimonious hypothesis. The hypothesis has implications for toilet training and for management of nocturnal enuresis. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Primäre. nächtliche Enuresis beruht nicht immer auf derselben Ursache und häufig sind verschiedene Fakroten daran beteiligt. Mit zunehmendem Alter verändert sich der für die nächtliche Enuresis in der Hauptsache verantwortliche Faktor. Die gegenwärtigen, verschiedenen Erklärungen scheinen nur auf Minoritätsgruppen Bezug zu haben. Primäre, nächtliche Enuresis verursacht manchmal Beängstigungen, aber ist kein Beweis von zugrundeliegender, psychologischer Störung. Während des zweiten, dritten und vierten Lebensjahres wird häufig die nächtliche Kontrolle über die Blase erzielt. Darauf folgt eine Zeitspanne von verschiedenen Jahren, während der die nächtliche Blasenkontrolle selten erreicht wird. Ethologen reden von einer ‘sensitiven Periode des Lernens’, wovon dies die charakteristischen Hauptmerkmale sind. Es wird bewiesen, dass angsterzeugende Ereignisse während des dritten Lebensjahres häufiger vorkamen bei Kindern die später unter primärer, nächtlicher Enuresis leiden, als bei Kindern die trocken sind. Ausserdem wird Ansich geäussert, dass Beängstigungen während des dritten Lebensjahres häufig die Hauptursache für das Versagen der Kinder ist, die nächtliche Kontrolle der Blase vor dem Eintritt in den schwierigen Lernzeitraum zu erreichen. Das Bettnässen besteht als primäre Enuresis weiter; die Beängstigung ist meistens vorübergehend. Da man annimmt, das s der Beginn der Enuresis auf Beängstigungen zurückzuführen ist, die Hypothese, dass Ängstlichkeitenwegen Erzielung der nächtlichen Blasenkontrolle während des sensitiven Lernzeitraumes, em häufiger Faktor in der Urheblichkeit der nächtlichen Enuresis darstellt, eine vereinheitlichende Hypothese, die für die Erziehung zur Sauberkeit und die Behandlung der nächtlichen Enuresis von Bedeutung ist. RESUMEN La enuresis nocturna primaria no es debida siempre a la misma causa, y muchas veces son varios factores que juegan un papel. Por lo commún, la causa principal de la enuresis varía a medida que el niño crece. Las diferentes explicaciones pueden aplicarse solamente a grupos minoritarios. A veces, la enuresis nocturna primaria causa ansiedad, pero no es evidencia de un disturbio psicológico fundamental. El control nocturno de la vejiga se obtiene en el segundo, tercero y cuarto, años. En los años siguientes es mucho mas dificil conseguir este control. Estas son las caracteristicas que los etologistas llaman ‘periodo sensitive de aprendizaje’. Los episodios que provocan ansiedad durante el tercer año de vida, son caracteristicas frecuentes en el historial de los niños que tienen enuresis nocturna desde su nacimiento. Sugiero que estos episodios son los mas responsables en el fracaso de aprender el control nocturno de la vejiga, antes de entrar en el periodo de dificuldad de aprendienje. La enuresis persiste como ‘enuresis de naciomiento’. Pero la ansiedad es normalmente pasajera. Se admite que la enuresis adquirida es debida a la ansiedad. La hipotesis de que la ansiedad en el ‘periodo sensitivo de aprendiente’ es una factor frecuente en los origenes de la enuresis nocturna de nacimiento, es una hipotesis unificante, ya que da la misma causa a esta que a la enuresis adquirida. Esta hipotesis tiene relacion con el entrenamiento de ninos en el control de la vejiga y el tratamiento de la enuresis nocturna.",

      "title": "Convulsiones y epilepsia—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Las convulsiones son causadas por un ataque de actividad excesiva en el cerebro. Un niño que tiene una convulsión puede perder el conocimiento (desmayarse) durante un período breve, temblar violentamente con todo su cuerpo, tener movimientos corporales reiterados y poco comunes, sufrir crisis atónicas (episodios de caída), tener convulsiones mientras duerme o tener la mirada perdida.La epilepsia se define como 2 o más convulsiones en las que el niño no tiene fiebre ni ningún otro motivo médico para sufrir una convulsión.Alrededor de 1 de cada 4 niños con trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés) tiene convulsiones. Las convulsiones suelen comenzar en la primera infancia o en los primeros años de la adolescencia. Los niños con TEA que tienen un coeficiente intelectual más bajo o que no pueden hablar son los que corren mayor riesgo de tener convulsiones.Con frecuencia los niños con TEA tienen movimientos reiterativos y episodios en los que se quedan mirando el vacío. A menudo un médico puede detectar qué comportamientos reiterativos podrían ser convulsiones. Una prueba llamada electroencefalograma (EEG) puede registrar la actividad eléctrica del cerebro y ayudar a un médico a verificar la presencia de convulsiones. El electroencefalograma puede registrar la ocurrencia de una convulsión solo cuando el equipo de EEG está conectado al niño. No es posible detectar con un EEG las convulsiones que ocurran en otros momentos. A veces es necesario hacer un EEG durante un tiempo prolongado para ver si los movimientos o desmayos son convulsiones.La mayoría de los niños con TEA no necesitan un EEG. Es probable que el médico solicite un EEG si un niño tiene desmayos que el médico crea que son convulsiones o si el niño perdió recientemente destrezas de habla o de otro tipo. El electroencefalograma se hace generalmente cuando el niño está despierto y luego dormido. Hay distintos tipos de EEG; algunos se completan durante una visita más corta al hospital y otros se realizan durante toda la noche en el hospital o en el hogar. El médico decidirá qué tipo de EEG es adecuado para cada niño.En la mayoría de los casos, los medicamentos llamados anticonvulsivos pueden ayudar a controlar las convulsiones. Por lo general estos medicamentos reducen la cantidad de convulsiones, pero no siempre pueden eliminarlas. Algunos niños obtienen resultados anormales en sus EEG, pero no tienen convulsiones evidentes. Aún no está claro si los anticonvulsivos pueden ser útiles en esas situaciones.Uno de 2 tipos específicos de aceite de cannabidiol (conocido como aceite CBD) está actualmente aprobado por la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (US Food and Drug Administration) para el tratamiento de convulsiones en niños con 2 tipos de epilepsia grave (los síndromes de Lennox-Gastaut y de Dravet). El aceite de cannabidiol no está aprobado para el manejo del TEA en niños que no padezcan las afecciones específicas que se mencionaron anteriormente.Para obtener más información sobre las convulsiones, comuníquese con la Epilepsy Foundation (www.epilepsyfoundation.org).La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

      "abstract": "1. Infantile convulsions do not occur in a group of unselected cases more frequently than once in every 10 to 14 cases. 2. There seems to be no prognostic value to the pathological, physiological or psychological factors with which the first convulsion is associated. 3. Those cases where the convulsions occur without any apparent exciting factor (that is without trauma, teething, gastro-intestinal upsets, etc.) are invariably more significant and the prognosis should be more guarded than those cases where the convulsion is associated with some definite etiology. 4. In a fairly large group of cases, the convulsion is but a symptom of an unstable nervous system, one that is unable to withstand the ordinary vicissitudes to which the normal child is subjected. 5. There is undoubtedly a fairly large group of convulsive disorders in childhood where the convulsions are symptoms of an undiagnosed meningitis or encephalitis, which leaves behind irreparable damage to the nervous system. 6. The convulsion itself, though not associated with any devastating disease, such as meningitis, or encephalitis, may produce damage from which the brain never recovers, as seen in: (a) Some of the spastic conditions which follow immediately upon a series of convulsions. (b) Those cases following convulsions without neurological signs, but which have to adjust on a very much lower mental level. 7. The convulsions associated with rickets and tetany may leave behind very definite damage to the nervous system. 8. There is reason to believe that if the infantile convulsions associated with rickets, gastro-intestinal upsets, and acute infections were looked upon more seriously, and a greater effort made to prevent their occurrence during early life, much epilepsy and mental deficiency might be prevented.",

      "title": "Somatoform and conversion disorders as psychological defences",
      "abstract": "Conversion disorder is the clinical situation in which one or more symptoms can present deficits that affect motor or sensory function and suggest a neurological or organic condition. Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "Refreshing sleep requires both sufficient total sleep time as well as sleep that is in synchrony with the individual's circadian rhythm. Problems with sleep organization in elderly patients typically include difficulty falling asleep, less time spent in the deeper stages of sleep, early-morning awakening and less total sleep time. Poor sleep habits such as irregular sleep-wake times and daytime napping may contribute to insomnia. Caffeine, alcohol and some medications can also interfere with sleep. Primary sleep disorders are more common in the elderly than in younger persons. Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep and may respond to low doses of antiparkinsonian agents as well as other drugs. Sleep apnea can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness. Evaluation of sleep problems in the elderly includes careful screening for poor sleep habits and other factors that may be contributing to the sleep problem. Formal sleep studies may be needed when a primary sleep disorder is suspected or marked daytime dysfunction is noted. Therapy with a benzodiazepine receptor agonist may be indicated after careful evaluation.",

      "title": "Editorial: Psychological sleep studies: new insights to support and integrate clinical practice within the healthcare system, volume II",
      "abstract": "Sleep health is essential for overall physical and mental well-being. Insufficient sleep, whether in terms of quantity or quality, significantly impacts an individual's quality of life and day-to-day functioning [1]. Consequences of sleep disorders like insomnia include impaired daytime cognition, reduced work productivity, an increased risk of accidents and injuries, and have been linked to psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and other chronic health conditions. [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].Sleep problems may compromise with the treatments that are currently being administered for a wide range of illnesses. When these disorders are addressed, they have the potential to enhance the patient's quality of life and adherence to therapy, as well as the intensity of the psychological symptoms that they are experiencing. It has been shown that there is a complicated association between sleep and mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress disorders. This interaction is considered to be bidirectional [2], [16], [17]. There is a growing demand in the clinical setting for psychologists who are skilled in evidence-based psychotherapy to become members of multidisciplinary health teams. These psychologists would be tasked with providing cognitive-behavioral intervention and support for patients suffering from insomnia [18], narcolepsy [19], [20], and adherence to treatment for obstructive sleep apnea [21].This volume brings together a collection of research that delves into different aspects of sleep health and its relationship with psychological well-being, offering new approaches to addressing these challenges in various populations. The findings provide critical implications for clinical practice, aiming to improve sleep health management across diverse healthcare settings.Luo et al. [22] investigate the mental health challenges, particularly anxiety and poor sleep, experienced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their study shows that Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) significantly alleviates anxiety and improves sleep quality among practitioners in high-stress environments like mobile cabin hospitals. The intervention demonstrated a reduction in both anxiety and poor sleep indices, offering an accessible and effective solution to mitigate mental health strains during pandemicrelated crises.This study highlights the potential of PMR as a non-invasive, cost-effective intervention that could be readily implemented in healthcare systems to support the mental health of frontline workers. Given the global scale of the healthcare crisis, integrating such tools into standard healthcare practice could enhance workforce wellbeing and performance.In their study, O'Regan et al. [23] explore the patient journey in managing insomnia across Europe and Canada. By mapping the phases of insomnia management, from self-initiated behavioral changes to long-term reliance on prescription medications, the authors reveal a considerable gap in the alignment of healthcare provider strategies and patient needs. Their research uncovers key points where interventions can be improved, particularly in addressing patient expectations and enhancing education around sleep hygiene and nonpharmacological treatments.Overall, the findings show that patient education is crucial to remove the stigma surrounding insomnia, helping patients recognize that chronic insomnia is a primary disorder that requires appropriate medical management, and encouraging them to seek help earlier. Additionally, healthcare provider education and training on sleep disorders are essential to increase the perception of chronic insomnia as a serious primary medical condition and to fully understand its significant impact on patients' daily lives. Furthermore, the current situation, in which many patients must settle for \"manageable\" insomnia, highlights a serious unmet need regarding the management and treatment of this condition. More comprehensive approaches are needed to ensure that patients receive effective care that goes beyond symptom management, addressing the root causes of their insomnia and improving their long-term health outcomes.Wale et al. [24] shed light on the high prevalence of insomnia among university students in Ethiopia. Their study identifies key predictors, including gender, age, mild anxiety symptoms, and excessive use of mobile devices before bedtime, which significantly contribute to poor sleep quality among students. The findings underscore the impact of lifestyle factors and mental health challenges on sleep patterns in young adults, a group particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances due to academic stress and lifestyle transitions.The study calls for targeted interventions focusing on mental health support and promoting better sleep hygiene among university students. Educational institutions should integrate sleep health education into their wellness programs, emphasizing the importance of mental health and limiting late-night screen exposure.Zambelli et al. evaluate the feasibility of delivering CBT-I through telehealth to chronic pain patients suffering from insomnia [25]. The study shows that adapted CBT-I delivered via telehealth not only improved sleep quality but also alleviated symptoms of anxiety, and depression. The research highlights the growing role of telehealth in making effective sleep interventions more accessible, particularly for populations with mobility issues or those living in remote areas.Telehealth-based interventions offer a scalable and practical solution to reach populations with limited access to in-person therapy. As healthcare systems continue to embrace digital health solutions, telehealth-based CBT-I can play a pivotal role in addressing sleep disorders, particularly in the post-pandemic era where telehealth has become more prominent.While the studies presented in this volume offer important insights, several areas remain unexplored, signaling opportunities for future research. First, the long-term effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions like PMR and CBT-I across diverse populations, including adolescents and the elderly, needs further investigation. Additionally, the impact of behavioral and lifestyle factors, such as mobile device use before bedtime, which has been shown to significantly influence sleep quality, particularly among younger populations, requires deeper examination.As telehealth becomes an increasingly central component of healthcare delivery, there is also a need to assess its broader efficacy across varying cultural contexts, socioeconomic groups, and medical conditions.Understanding how digital interventions like telehealth-delivered CBT-I can be optimized to meet the needs of different populations will be crucial for the equitable expansion of these services.The collection of research in this volume underscores the profound interconnectedness of sleep health and psychological well-being. From frontline healthcare workers grappling with anxiety during pandemics to chronic pain patients benefiting from telehealth-delivered CBT-I, these studies highlight the necessity of integrating sleep health into broader mental healthcare strategies. Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, despite their substantial repercussions on both individual and societal health.Psychologists play a crucial role in addressing sleep-related disorders, not only through therapeutic interventions such as CBT-I but also by promoting sleep hygiene and mental wellness as foundational elements of health. Academic training programs in psychology should emphasize the importance of sleep as a pillar of mental well-being, equipping future practitioners with the skills to recognize, address, and treat sleep disturbances as part of a comprehensive mental health approach.To advance a holistic approach, healthcare systems must prioritize early detection and treatment of sleep disorders, leveraging cross-disciplinary methods that integrate mental health, technology, and lifestyle interventions. This volume provides a robust foundation for understanding the significance of sleep in clinical practice, yet ongoing research and innovation will be essential to refine and expand these approaches, fostering a truly integrative model of mental healthcare that includes sleep as a central component.",

Long-term suffering can result in somatic symptoms and the development of diseases. It can even induce diseases with a mental dimension. Insomnia causes indications of poor health. No systematic analysis of insomnia has been performed, however. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to describe the concept of insomnia. In accordance with Walker and Avant's (2005) methodology of concept analysis, this paper presents a review of the conceptual definitions, characteristics, antecedents and consequences, constructing examples, and empirical references of insomnia. The results indicate that: (1) Insomnia's defining attributes are recognized as an insufficient of quality and quantity for sleep for more than one month. (2) Antecedents of insomnia include changes in life habits, physiological demands caused by sleep time changes, and the experience of uncomfortable sensations. (3) Consequences of insomnia include a poor condition, with physical, psychological, social, and global dimensions. (4) There are many instruments that can be used to inspect insomnia, including questionnaires and tools for physiological measurement. Insomnia is a serious problem with various facets. An understanding of the concept of insomnia will help nurses to perceive this problem in caring for subjects.",

However, there are some disorders which are only found in infancy, as in the four conditions which we review below. In spite of great variation between individuals, the general way in which the wakefulness-sleep states mature during the first months of life is well known. In general the physiological patterns of REM and NREM are in general the same in children as in adults. However, the pathological patterns are similar, but there are major differences between them. These differences are mainly physiological, behavioural, parent-child relationship and specific disorders. We shall see that the central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome of infants is not the same as that of adults. The sleep apnea syndrome of the newborn is different to the apneas seen in older children. Benign neonatal myoclonia of sleep are not present in adults, and finally the sudden death of an infant is not like the unexplained nocturnal sudden death or sinus arrest linked to paradoxical sleep in adults.",

The rest of REM parasomnias (sleep related painful erection, catathrenia) may have other still unclear mechanisms. REM parasomnias deserve attention, because in addition to disturbing sleep and causing injuries, they may shed light on REM sleep functions as well as the heterogeneous etiologies of parasomnias. One of them, REM sleep behavior disorder has special importance as a warning sign of evolving neurodegenerative conditions mainly synucleinopathies (some cases synucleinopathies themselves) and it is a model parasomnia revealing that parasomnias may have by autoimmune, iatrogenic and even psychosomatic etiologies.",

It is this fragmentation that is believed to be an important factor affecting impaired daytime wakefulness. Studies have suggested a strong association between sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness (55). Treatment studies also demonstrate a close link between sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness. Reduced frequency of arousals from sleep with resultant reduction in the level of sleepiness is commonly seen in patients who are successfully treated for sleep apnea, whereas those who do not subjectively beneﬁt from treatment show no decrease in arousals or sleepiness, despite improved sleeping oxygenation. It must, however, be stressed that lack of fragmented sleep does not exempt one from feeling sleepy. Partial sleep deprivation may occasionally be seen in patients who are unable to sustain sleep from repeated sleep disruption. This is commonly seen in patients with anxiety predispositions or superimposed insomnia.",

      "abstract": "The main criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are a change in cognitive function with rapid onset of symptoms and/or fluctuating sensorium, impairment of attention and development of perceptual disturbance. Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

Insomnia also involves daytime consequences such as fatigue, lack of energy, concentration difficulties and irritability. Psychiatric disoders are a common cause of chronic insomnia.

      "abstract": "Balance disorders can be due to many different reasons. Some possible causes are: Inner ear problems: Located in the inner ear, the vestibular system controls the balance of the body. Factors such as infections, traumas or aging in the inner ear can affect the vestibular system and cause imbalances. Brain damage: Damage to the brain, especially damage to areas responsible for balance control, such as the brain stem, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum, can cause imbalances. Nervous system problems: Nervous system problems can cause imbalances by causing problems in communicating with your body’s sensory information and motor functions. Medication side effects: Some medications can cause symptoms such as dizziness or unsteadiness as a side effect. Eye disorders: Visual disturbances, especially problems with coordination between the eyes or damage to the retina, can cause imbalances. Low blood pressure: Low blood pressure can also cause imbalance, especially when you get up suddenly or go to high altitudes. Stress and anxiety: Stress and anxiety can cause symptoms such as dizziness and unsteadiness in some people.",

      "abstract": "Sleepis one of the best-documented factors influencing the expression of seizuresand interictal discharges. Janz studied the relation between seizures and thesleep/wake cycle and divided the epilepsies into three categories: nocturnal,awakening, and diffuse. Since then, the effect of sleep on the ictal andinterictal manifestations of epilepsy has been studied extensively. Manyseizures are activated by sleep or arousal from sleep. Interictal dischargesare also seen more commonly during sleep, with the greatest activation seenduring nonrapid eye movement sleep. Sleep not only increases the frequency ofepileptiform abnormalities, but also may alter their morphology anddistribution. Sleep deprivation also facilitates both epileptiformabnormalities and seizures. Seizures, on the other hand, also impact sleep.Epileptic patients demonstrate multiple sleep abnormalities, including anincreased sleep latency, fragmented sleep, increased awakenings and stageshifts, and an increase in stages 1 and 2 of nonrapid eye movement sleep.These disturbances may in turn be modulated by antiepileptic treatment. Thisreview summarizes the interactions between sleep and epilepsy, including thetiming of seizures during the sleep/wake cycle, the influence of sleep onvarious seizure disorders, the effects of sleep deprivation, and the changesin sleep patterns caused by seizures and theirtreatment.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of Progressive Resistance Training for theChildren with Spastic Diplegic Cerebral Palsy: A ControlledExperimental study",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION :\r\nCerebral Palsy (CP) is defined as a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture causing activity limitation that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal (or) infant brain. The motor disorders of CP are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication and behaviour by epilepsy and\r\nsecondary musculoskeletal problems. The incidence of CP is well raised above 2.0 per 1,000 live birth in the past 40 years. The Fetal brain injury that occurs during the prenatal, postnatal and neonatal period ends up in CP. The causes can be specified as: intra uterine exposure to infection, inflammation, disorders of coagulation, interruption of oxygen supply during birth, low APGAR score, seizures, low birth weight, pre term and non specific indicators of neonatal illness.\r\nCP can be classified based on the movements as hypertonic or spastic, ataxic, dyskinetic, mixed and hypotonic6. Based on the function, CP is classified as quadriplegic, diplegic, hemiplegic and monoplegic7. Spasticity is the most common movement disorder among the patients with CP 8. Spastic diplegia is most prevalent form of CP.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY :\r\nThe study was aimed to find out the effect of PRE training on the functional out come in the spastic diplegic CP children.\r\nOBJECTIVES :\r\n1. To find out the effect of PRE training in the spastic diplegic CP on the gross motor function in the experimental group.\r\n2. To find out the effect of conventional therapy in the spastic diplegic CP on the gross motor function in the control group.\r\n3. To find out the effect of PRE training in the spastic diplegic CP on the mobility function in the experimental group.\r\n4. To find out the effect of conventional therapy in the spastic diplegic CP on the mobility function in the control group.\r\n5. To find out the effect of PRE training in the spastic diplegic CP on the strength in the experimental group.\r\n6. To find out the effect of conventional therapy in the spastic diplegic CP on the strength in the control group.\r\n7. To find out the effect of PRE training in the spastic diplegic CP on the spasticity in the experimental group.\r\n8. To find out the effect of conventional therapy in the spastic diplegic CP on the spasticity in the control group.\r\n9. To compare the gross motor functional outcome difference between the experimental and control group.\r\n10. To compare mobility functional outcome difference between the experimental and control group.\r\n11. To compare the strength gain between the experimental and control group.\r\n12. To compare the change in spasticity between the experimental and control group.\r\nMETHODOLOGY :\r\nStudy Design :\r\nA controlled Experimental study.\r\nStudy Setting :\r\nPhysiotherapy Outpatient Department, and Pediatric Inpatient\r\nDepartment of Sri Ramakrishna Multi Specialty Hospital, Coimbatore.\r\nSampling Technique : A Convenience sampling.\r\nSample Size :\r\nA total of 30 spastic diplegic CP children was selected on the basis of the selection criteria and conveniently allocated in two groups. The group A (experimental group) consist of 15 children and the other group B (control group)consist of 15 children.\r\nStudy Duration :\r\nThe study was conducted over a period of 1 year.\r\nTreatment Duration :\r\nThe treatment duration was 12 weeks.\r\nSelection Criteria :\r\na) Inclusion criteria :\r\n• Age: 4-10 years.\r\n• Both gender.\r\n• Able to accept and follow verbal instructions.\r\n• Ability to walk independently in indoors and outdoors with (or) without mobility aids.\r\n• Children with spastic diplegic CP under the Gross Motor\r\nFunctional Classification System (GMFCS) level I-III.\r\nb) Exclusion criteria :\r\n• Unstable seizures.\r\n• Any surgical procedures up to 3 months prior to the study.\r\n• Botulium toxin injection up to 6 months prior to the study.\r\n• Other cardio vascular and pulmonary disease which interferes the resisted training exercise.\r\nRESULTS :\r\nThe results confirmed the effect of PRE training was effective than the conventional therapy in the improvement of the gross motor function, mobility function and strength without the adverse effects of increasing spasticity. The result supported the previous studies which stated the PRE can improve the functional status without the adverse effect. Result of the study showed the relationship with the muscle strength and gross motor function25. The study determined that there was significant strength gain in the muscle targeted in the lower limbs, which was also stated in the other studies showed the direct relationship between the lower limb muscle strength and gait parameters. The gained strength of the lower limb muscles can improve the function by strengthened hip muscle stabilizing the pelvic motions in walking, the strengthened knee muscle can improved the degree of crouch gait and increased fast walking, the strengthened ankle muscle can improve the propulsive action of the foot in terminal stands phase34, decreased energy consumption by normalizing the abnormal joint position, and cardiovascular fitness gained after the PRE training36. All these factors contributed for the improvement in the gait parameters such as increased speed, increased stride length, increased cadence and increased single limb balancing during walking.\r\nCONCLUSION :\r\nThe study confirmed the effect of PRE training in the\r\nfunctional status of the spastic diplegic CP who are ambulating. The result of the study showed that the PRE for spastic dipelgic CP can increase the strength of the muscle thus improve gross motor function and mobility without the adverse effect of increased muscle tone.",

      "abstract": "Summary The incidence of casualties in an institution for mentally retarded children is shown to be about three times as great as in the normal Danish child population. The circumstances concerned are analysed by means of a retrospective investigation to elucidate the mechanisms involved and the contributory factors. The investigation reveals that there is a definite relationship between the degree of mental handicap and the underlying disease (e.g. epilepsy and/or cerebral paresis, mon‐golism etc.) and the incidence of casualties. Other types of incapacity such as motor handicap, anaesthesia, defective sight or hearing and other physical disease (e.g. hydrocephalus) may predispose to accidents. Some children are undoubtedly more accident‐prone than others and the cause may be found in their disease (most frequently epilepsy) while, in others, purposeless motor activity and the inability to learn from experience combined with severe or profound mental retardation appear to be responsible. Phases of accident‐proneness may be associated with the acquiring of new skills. Some prophylactic measures are suggested which should be considered when new institutions are planned. A broad spectrum of somatic, developmental, handicap, environmental, emotional and mental factors interplay in the production of accidents in mentally retarded patients. Attempts should be made to analyse the mechanism of every accident so that appropriate prophylactic measures can be undertaken.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and, in type one, cataplexy, often accompanied by disrupted nocturnal sleep, parasomnias, and other impairments. This study aims to explore patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences of these symptoms. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using narrative semi-structured interviews with 25 narcolepsy patients, guided by a structure approved by a multidisciplinary expert board. The interviews, conducted at the patients’ homes or hospitals, were transcribed, inductively analyzed to develop a codebook, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The onset and manifestation were key themes for each symptom. EDS was often described as “microsleeps” or “shutting off,” causing embarrassment when occurring publicly and influenced by factors such as the weather, seasons, or menstruation. Cataplexy was commonly triggered by positive emotions or situations, including sexual intercourse, with patients often suppressing emotions to prevent episodes, leading to misinterpretations by others as drunkenness. Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including vivid dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, led to negative emotional experiences. Overall, narcolepsy symptoms significantly impacted patients’ emotional well-being. Conclusion The burden of narcolepsy is deeply tied to patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences, significantly affecting their quality of life, yet few studies have used qualitative approaches to explore their perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Major depression is a common disorder; nearly 10% of the population suffers from a depressive illness in any given year. There is a strong association between sleep disturbances and depression. The most common sleep disturbance associated with major depressive disorder is insomnia. The relationship between insomnia and depression is bidirectional in that insomnia is one of the symptoms of depression and chronic insomnia can be a risk factor for depression. Depression causes changes in sleep patterns and sleep quality. Depressed patients showed prolonged sleep latency, increased wakefulness during sleep, early morning awakening, decreased sleep efficiency, decreased amounts of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep abnormalities. Depression is currently one of the leading causes of disability in the world. There is a direct association between the severity of depression and the level of disability. Depression has a big impact on quality of life of patients. Studies have showed that patients with major depressive disorder have poorer quality of life than persons from the general population. Effects of depression on quality of life are equal to or greater than those of patients with chronic medical conditions. Untreated depression usually does not go away by itself and often gets worse with time and increases a person's risk of suicide; it is a fact that up to 15% of those who are clinically depressed die through suicide. Clinical depression is treatable with counseling and medication. The majority of people with depressive disorders improve when they receive appropriate treatment. Improvement in depressive symptoms during the treatment is related to improvement in the quality of life. Antidepressants are shown to improve quality of life. There are some tools for evaluating quality of life in depressive patients, today. These tools help us to assess improvement in depressive patients beyond the extent to which depression rating scales do. In clinical settings, quality of life instruments can show us when patients begin to feel benefits of antidepressant therapy.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "abstract": "The consequences of respiratory sleep disturbances on neurocognitive function in children have impelled increased research efforts, which thus far suggest a strong causal association between the episodic hypoxia and sleep fragmentation that characterize the disease and the development of diminished memory, attention, and intelligence. Inappropriate sleep habits in children have increased in developed countries and have become a major public health concern. Indeed, the impositions of daily life in technologically advanced societies on sleep and wake schedules have markedly shortened the total duration of sleep that children obtain these days. When sleep fragmentation is conducted in healthy adults using auditory stimuli to elicit arousals throughout the night, detriments in performance are clearly apparent the following day. Acute sleep restriction for one night in children has been shown to increase inattentive behavior the following day, although no changes were observed in hyperactive or impulsive behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis is underestimated as a cause of suffering and diminished quality of life in children and adolescents. If nasal symptoms such as itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and congestion are not well controlled during the day, they may contribute to learning problems during school hours. If these symptoms are not well controlled during the night, they may contribute to nocturnal sleep loss, secondary daytime fatigue and learning impairment. Even uncomplicated seasonal allergic rhinitis may be associated with reduced ability to learn, and the likelihood of learning problems may increase in severe perennial rhinitis or in rhinitis associated with complications such as sinusitis or eustachian tube dysfunction and conductive hearing loss. Also, many of the medications used to treat allergic rhinitis may cause central nervous system adverse effects and contribute to learning impairment. For some medications, such as inhaled glucocorticoids and decongestants, the potential effect on central nervous system function and learning has not been tested. For others such as H1-receptor antagonists (antihistamines), well-designed, prospective studies have been performed. The newer relatively nonsedating medications such as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine have less potential to impair central nervous system function and learning than their predecessors.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Sleep problems are common in childhood. Disturbed sleep behaviours are among the most common concerns that parents of young children bring to their physicians. Defining disordered sleep behaviour is difficult because of important differences in sleep patterns at different developmental stages. The sudden onset of a sleep disorder or problem can be due to physical, mental and/or environmental factors. Objectives To present the case of a young boy admitted to the emergency department of the Pediatric Hospital of Coimbra due to a sudden inability to sleep. Results A 6-year-old boy with previous language delay and undergoing regular psychotherapy due to family distress issues presented with inability to sleep for more than 10–15 minutes. The disturbances started 2 weeks prior to presentation and occurred more than 10 times per night. Immediately after each event the patient was screaming, frightened, unable to communicate normally with his mother. Since the beginning of the episodes the patient's social performance had declined, he was easily irritated, aggressive and with dysphoric mood. The patient was admitted and evaluated by child psychiatry in the emergency department. An extensive psychiatric evaluation revealed familyrelated stressors, depression and anxiety symptoms. An electroencephalogram was performed which revealed frontal lobe epilepsy. After the diagnosis treatment sodium valproate was started (30mg/kg/day). The symptoms reversed. Conclusions This case highlights how psychiatric manifestations or comorbidity may interfere in the understanding of clinical manifestations of sleep disorders in children. In fact, as in this case, symptoms may be related to underlying conditions, namely epilepsy.",

      "title": "A boy with dissociative symptoms who benefited from biopsychosocial assessment",
      "abstract": "Dissociative disorder is defined in the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) as “a partial or complete loss of the normal integration between memories of the past, awareness of identity and immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements,” and its prevalence in children is as low as 1.30 per 100,000 population.1 We report a case of dissociative disorder secondary to a combination of psychosocial factors in addition to the developmental characteristics of the patient, both of which have been overlooked. A 9-year-old boy suddenly lost consciousness during class one day and received a diagnosis of suspected epilepsy at another hospital. One month later, during another class, he lost consciousness again after experiencing a tremor in his hands. A close examination revealed no abnormality, and the patient was thought to have suspected psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Various short-lived involuntary movements with impaired consciousness were often observed and gradually increased in frequency, and odd behavior was observed: When the subject of school or home came up, the child would suddenly become “spaced out,” scratch his face with his hands “like an animal,” and mimic “meow” for several tens of seconds, unable to communicate with staff. The neurologist re-examined the patient for neurological diseases including encephalitis, temporal lobe epilepsy as differential diagnoses. However, various laboratory tests and imaging studies were negative for organic diseases. The fact that positive symptoms appeared only during stress was also suggestive of nonorganic disease. Outpatient treatment was initiated in our department but the patient was admitted to the liaison department for biopsychosocial assessment because of frequent school absences and his mother's increasing fatigue due to difficulties in raising her child at home. During his hospitalization, we conducted a psychosocial assessment by interviewing his mother about his upbringing and developmental history, observing his behavior, and conducting psychological tests. The interviews revealed his rigid thought patterns and sensory sensitivity from early childhood, and the observations of his behavior revealed a lack of nonverbal communication, so we diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. The case formulation based on the assessment results is shown in Table 1. In terms of biology, predisposing factors included cognitive bias—the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children®-Fourth Edition (WISC®-IV) at age 7 years: total IQ, 90; verbal comprehension, 119; perceptual reasoning, 76; working memory, 79; processing speed, 86—and developmental characteristics, such as obsessiveness, sensory sensitivity, and poor communication skills. As psychological factors, the initial seizures and loss of consciousness were considered to have been induced by stress with classmates, such as feelings of inferiority. Because both seizures occurred during group work, when he was being helped by group members with a task he was having difficulty with. As a social factor, there was domestic discord between parents and between siblings. The school was also unaware of the cognitive characteristics and did not take them into consideration in his daily life and learning. The stressors that he experienced therefore included changes in learning difficulty and interpersonal relationships due to his promotion to the next grade. As a therapeutic intervention, risperidone was administered as a biological treatment for the irritability in autism spectrum disorder, and psychotherapy was conducted to explain the disease to the parents and the patient, and to encourage the patient to verbalize the disease. As social treatment, we provided parents with disease education and parent training according to their son's developmental characteristics. We also shared information with the school regarding the school's understanding of the child and reasonable accommodation, including symptoms caused by the child's developmental characteristics, necessary environmental adjustments, and involvement in school situations that would encourage verbalization. After explaining the findings to the patient and his family, the dissociative symptoms gradually resolved during the 2-week hospitalization, and the patient was discharged. Fortunately, his relationship with his family has improved, and he has been transferred to a special-needs class. In this case, “personality switching,” “detachment,” “loss of sense of reality,” and “dissociative convulsions” were present as dissociative symptoms. There have been few case reports of children with dissociative disorders secondary to autism spectrum disorders.2 It is possible that the prevalence of dissociative disorders is low and that many cases, such as the present case, go undiagnosed without adequate evaluation of developmental characteristics as background. The psychosocial factors of pediatric patients with PNES are numerous and complex3 and now that biopsychosocial assessment is mandatory. “Consultation liaison psychiatry” that links psychiatry and physical medicine and provides comprehensive medical care to patients is necessary.4 Although the clinical course and symptoms of this case were atypical and difficult to diagnose, a case formulation5 from a biopsychosocial perspective in collaboration with the liaison department and the neurology department clarified each of the complex overlapping factors, leading to the planning and implementation of an effective comprehensive treatment. Further development of pediatric consultation liaison psychiatry to enhance biopsychosocial assessment would be of great benefit. The authors declare no conflict of interest.

      "title": "Depression: some proposals for future research.",
      "abstract": "The argument has been advanced that pathological states of anxiety and mania are both characterized by a failure on the part of the patient to attach appropriate levels of significance to changes occurring in the immediate environment. There is, it is suggested, a tendency for environmental features to be regarded as important even though, viewed objectively, they may have little relevance to the patient and his needs. Depression, it is further proposed, may be viewed as an extreme defense reaction to the intense anxiety which results from attaching too much significance to environmental events. In depressive state, patients are often characterised by their lowered responsiveness to stimulation and their lack of interest in, or concern about, their surroundings: it may be that, in such state, information processing has been blocked or reduced. The daytime drowsiness of the depressed patients, as well as his night-time sleep disturbance and the frequently observed recurrent or cyclic nature of certain kinds of depressed state, suggest that this blocking of sensory processing may be brought about by the involuntary intervention of mechanisms responsible, under normal circumstances, for sleep induction. This view of the nature of depression has been recast into the form of five potentially testable hypotheses. Speculation is always easy; providing convincing demonstrations that those speculations are reasonable is less easy. It is in the nature of psychological investigation that laboratory-based studies distort and may even destroy the phenomena about which information is sought, and many a perfectly reasonable theory has foundered upon the rocks of translation into experimental terms. In those areas of psychology which have implications for psychiatry and the conceptualisation of psychopathological states, this danger is particularly evident: psychiatric syndromes are complex, variable, and have social referrents, but laboratory experiments are limited in their capacity to reflect all these attributes, and consequently they may never provide really adequate tests of a theory about a psychiatric state. We have to try to come to terms with this apparent impasse--in the first place by being circumspect in translating psychiatric concepts into experimental terms, and secondly by exercising caution in interpreting the results to which the experiments give rise. More importantly, however, we have to accept the essential inadequacy of the majority of experimental paradigms in psychiatric research and to regard theorizing--even when it is not linked to explicitly testable hypotheses--as having inherent value.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders (CRSWD) are sleep dysfunctions related to circadian functioning. They are characterized by symptoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness that occur because the intrinsic circadian pacemaker is not entrained to a 24-h light/dark cycle. Affected individuals with a free-running disorder or hypernycthemeral syndrome (N24SWD) have a longer sleep–wake cycle that produces a sleep pattern that typically delays each day. The disorder is seen in 70% of blind people, and among people with healthy vision, it is a rare pathology. Among sighted cases, 80% are young men and 28% have a psychiatric disorder. The patient was a 14-year-old boy with a psychiatric pathology diagnosed with a PANDAS syndrome (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci), a sudden acute and debilitating onset of intense anxiety and mood lability accompanied by obsessive compulsive-like issues and/or tics, in association with a streptococcal A infection that occurs immediately prior to the symptoms. As a comorbidity, he exhibited severe insomnia due to an irregular sleep pattern that strongly delayed his sleep schedule day to day. It affected his daily routines, as he was not going to school, and aggravated, furthermore, the psychiatric symptoms. He was referred for sleep consultation, where the case was explored by ambulatory circadian monitoring (ACM) using the novel system Kronowise ® (Chronolab, University of Murcia) and diagnosed with a non-24-h sleep–wake disorder (N24SWD). The first treatment approach for the patient was focused on improving symptoms during the acute infection and psychiatric symptoms. Additionally, sleep pathology was treated by light therapy and melatonin. After 8 months and different trials, it was possible to establish a treatment to normalize the symptoms and fix his sleep rhythm in a normal schedule as well as to reduce anxious symptoms during the day. The association of PANDAS and N24SWD has not previously been reported in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Nightmares are defined as disturbing dreams associated with anxiety or fear that result in an awakening from sleep. The subject usually is readily aroused to full alertness and is able to recall much of the content of the dream. This distinguishes nightmares from night terrors, which are associated with a prolonged transition to wakefulness and scant recall of dream narrative. Although nightmares are featured prominently in literature and descriptive psychoanalytic writings, there is limited empirical research on this phenomenon. This fact is driven in part by pragmatic scientific limitations that make it difficult to observe neurocognitive events during the actual dream. Dreams can only be recalled following an awakening, and the fidelity of recall is not known. For example, it is possible that dream recall is limited to dream events occurring in the immediate period just prior to arousal. Further, dream recall is subject to retrieval biases in which the subject imposes order on what has been a chaotic mental experience.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "This perspective presents a new comprehensive proposal for sleep bruxism management. Sleep bruxism latest definition, epidemiology and etiologyIn accordance with the latest consensus, sleep bruxism (SB) is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep, characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic), and is not considered a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in otherwise healthy individuals. 1It is estimated to occur in up to 15% of the human adult population. 2 Despite many years of research, SB still constitutes a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.There are various risk factors that can contribute to SB: exogenous risk factors, such as smoking, heavy alcohol intake, caffeine, medications, or illicit drugs; psychosocial factors, including perceived stress and anxiety; sleep disorders, involving sleep arousal; and comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). 3Recent research also indicates that SB may be related to the neurotransmission of the serotonin and/or dopamine pathway. 4,5Severe SB seem to co-occur with lower serotonin blood levels, but is not correlated with the blood levels of the enzymes involved in the serotonin synthesis pathway. 5There are also studies supporting the genetic background of SB.The latest studies suggest that the polymorphisms occurring within the genes encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors may be linked with predisposition to SB and SB pathogenesis, and may contribute to the association between SB and OSA in adults. 6Similar associations with regard to the genes encoding dopamine receptors have been observed in children. 7In children, the additional factors increasing SB are the consumption of sugar, screen-time and sleeping habits. 8,9",

      "abstract": "In neurological practice one often encounters various forms of disturbances of the waking state. Sometimes somnolence is one of the manifestations of a pathological process, and in others it is the major and dominant symptom bringing the patient to the doctor. Our experience in the study of hypersomnia (we have observed 120 patients in recent years) demonstrates that physicians have inadequate familiarity with this problem. Sometimes somnolence is regarded not as the result of pathology, but as a manifestation of excessive fatigue. There is inadequate differentiation of the forms of hypersomnic disorders. One of the causes of these errors is the absence of a logical classification. The most thorough classification is that of A. Epshtein, (1) etiological in nature: 1) random sleep disorders; 2) secondary sleep disorders; 3) constitutional neuropathic; 4) reactive; 5) symptomatic; 6) essential disorders; and 7) sleep disorders associated with psychosis. It has become obsolete, and does not cover the clinical forms of hypersomnia. We have deemed it desirable to make a classification based on clinical principles, with due consideration for etiology.",

      "abstract": "Audience: This simulation session is appropriate for medical students, community physicians, or residents in emergency medicine, neurology, pediatrics, or family medicine. Introduction:Febrile seizures are the most common form of seizures in childhood; they are thought to occur in 2-5% of all children. 1-3Febrile seizures are defined as a seizure in association with a febrile illness in children without a central nervous system infection, previous afebrile seizure, known brain disorder, or electrolyte abnormalities. 1,2They typically occur between 6 months and 18 months of age though they can occur up to 5 years of age. 3 Febrile seizures are categorized as: simple (generalized seizure lasting less than 15 minutes in a child aged 6 months to 5 years, and less than 1 in a 24 hour period) or complex (a focal seizure or generalized seizure lasting greater than 15 minutes, or multiple seizures in a 24 hour period). 1,3 Treatment for febrile seizures is based on treating the underlying cause of the fever and giving reassurance and education to the parents. 2 Mortality is extremely rare, and there is no difference in the patient's cognitive abilities after a febrile seizure, even when the seizure is prolonged. 1Objectives: At the end of this simulation session, the learner will be able to: 1) discuss the management of febrile seizures 2) discuss when placement of an advanced airway is indicated in the management of a febrile seizure 3) list the risk factors for febrile seizures 4) prepare a differential diagnosis for the causes of febrile seizures 5) educate family members on febrile seizures.Methods: This educational session is a high-fidelity simulation.",

The clinical symptoms of this disorder are distinctive and form the basis for making the diagnosis. The severity of restless legs syndrome varies considerably. Some individuals have severe symptoms that cause repeated and prolonged awakenings. Others are aware of only mild symptoms at bedtime that prolong falling asleep. Patients may complain of insomnia, especially difficulty with sleep onset and repeated nighttime awakenings. Most characteristic of restless legs syndrome are reports of sensations deep in the muscles. This disorder may begin at any age, including during childhood. Restless legs syndrome is strongly associated with iron deficiency. It is also associated with pregnancy (especially the last trimester), kidney failure, dialysis, anemia, cancer, and other medical conditions that cause peripheral nerve and muscle disorders.",

Especially, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) frequently showed a disturbance of the sleep-wake circadian rhythm, on the other hand, dementia with Lewy bodies showed REM sleep behavior disorder. This disturbance of circadian rhythm is associated with degeneration of responsible area for sleep-wake regulation (i.e. suprachiasmatic nucleus: SCN, tuberomammillary nucleus: TMN etc.) and decreased melatonin secretion. To prevent or treat sleep disturbance in dementia, mixed modality approach with pharmacological, physical and social intervention and sleep-wake scheduling is needed.

      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of reported sleep disturbances in a general popula- tion is high. Many of the complaints are the result of sleep-related breathing dis- orders, due mainly to the occurrence of obstructive and central apnoeas. Obstructive sleep apnoea is a fully described and well-recognized entity. Central sleep apnoea (CSA) however, has been poorly studied. There is accumulating evidence that central sleep apnoea should be considered as the end of a spectrum. Instability in the breathing pattern is the main under- lying mechanism and is due to the interaction of many factors. Breathing during sleep is dependent on metabolic control and the activity of the respiratory muscles. Decreased chemical drive and/or failing respiratory muscle function are associated with CSA and usually also with ongoing hypoventilation during wakefulness, char- acterized by chronic daytime hypercapnia. Central respiratory drive can also be inhibited by upper airway reflexes. Mostly, however, CSA occurs as the hallmark of unstable breathing during sleep brought about by an overall increase in loop gain (especially in light sleep stages) and the unmasking of a CO 2 threshold. Arousal following central apnoeas acts as an amplification of the instability. Micro electroencephographic (EEG) arousals are often observed as a consequence of CSA. They are responsible for sleep fragmentation and hypersomnolence during the day. The daytime hypersomnolence and complaints of awakenings during sleep in patients with CSA can be striking. CSA can occur in specific pathologies, such as chronic heart failure and (post-traumatic) brain lesions, that are associated with irregular breathing. Treatment strategies are remarkably few in number. Use of nasal ventilation and the inhalation of CO 2 are mainly of theoretical interest, since patients do not often tolerate these more invasive therapies. Drug treatment, especially with aceta- zolamide, is easier to perform. Stimulation of upper airway reflexes, by less inva- sive methods, seems to be promising for the near future.",

Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

      "title": "Low Iron Status: A Possible Risk Factor for First Febrile Seizure",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: SEIZURES IN CHILDHOOD: A seizure or convulsion is a paroxysmal, time-limited change in\r\nmotor activity and/or behavior that result from abnormal electrical\r\nactivity in the brain. Seizures are common in the pediatric age group and\r\noccur in approximately 10% of children. Most seizures in children are\r\nprovoked by somatic disorders originating outside the brain, such as high\r\nfever, infection, syncope, head-trauma, hypoxia, toxins, or cardiac\r\narrhythmias. Other events, such as breath-holding spells and gastro\r\nesophageal reflux, can cause events that simulate seizures. A few children\r\nalso exhibit psychogenic seizures of psychiatric origin. Less than one\r\nthird of seizures in children are caused by epilepsy, a condition in which\r\nseizures are triggered recurrently from within the brain.\r\nFor epidemiological classification purposes, epilepsy is considered\r\nto be present when two or more unprovoked seizures occur at an interval\r\ngreater than 24 hr apart. The cumulative lifetime incidence of epilepsy is\r\n3% and more than half of cases begin in childhood. However, the annual\r\nprevalence of epilepsy is lower (0.5—0.8%) because many children\r\noutgrow epilepsy. Although the outlook for most children with symptomatic seizures\r\nor those associated with epilepsy is generally good, the seizures may\r\nsignal a potentially serious underlying systemic or central nervous system\r\n(CNS) disorder that requires thorough investigation and management. For\r\nchildren with epilepsy, the prognosis is generally good, but 10—20%\r\nhave persistent seizures refractory to drugs and those cases pose a\r\ndiagnostic and management challenge.\r\nSeizures have been recognized since ancient times and although\r\nimprovement has been made in management over this century compared\r\nto the previous 2000 years, there are still far too many children whose\r\nlives are crippled by poorly controlled seizures. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the association between Iron deficiency and the first\r\nfebrile seizure. DISCUSSION: 1. In our study to detect low iron status as a possible risk factor for\r\nfirst febrile seizures 50 cases and 50 age and sex matched controls are\r\nstudied and analyzed .\r\n2. In the present study we found that the peak incidence of febrile\r\nseizure occur during one to two years of age and the mean age is\r\n23.26 months. This is comparable to previous studies. The peak\r\nage of onset being 14-18 months of age as per Nelson textbook of\r\nPediatrics (22). Berg et al. in his study found that the peak\r\nincidence is between 18 and 24 months (12). Similarly Naveedur\r\nRehman et al. reported the peak incidence at 22 Months (18).\r\n3. The present study depicts that the incidence of febrile seizures is\r\nslightly higher in boys than in girls and the male: female ratio 2:1.\r\nThis is similar to the study by Berg et al (12), while Naveedur\r\nRehman et al. reported no gender difference in their study .\r\n4. In our study family history of febrile seizures is seen only in 14%\r\nof cases. But Forfar textbook of pediatrics mentions that 50% will\r\nhave a family history of convulsions and 80% of monozygotic\r\ntwins are concordant for febrile convulsions. 5. The mean serum ferritin level in our study is 27.39ng/ml . It is\r\nsimilar to Daoud AS et al. study from Jordan that the mean ferritin\r\nlevel was 29.5ng/ml (17) whereas Rajwanti K Vaswani et al. in his\r\nstudy group from India found that the mean ferritin level was 31.9\r\nng/ml(24) Similarly Momen Ali Akbar et al. reported a mean\r\nferritin level of 30.3 ng/ml (25).\r\n6. Daoud AS et al. in his study found that a significant proportion of\r\nchildren with febrile seizures had only low serum ferritin level\r\n(17). The proportion of children with febrile seizures having low\r\nhemoglobin, Mean Corpuscular Volume and Mean Corpuscular\r\nHemoglobin were not statistically significant. Similarly Momen\r\nAli Akbar et al . also in his study found lower ferritin in a\r\nsignificant proportion of children with febrile seizures without any\r\nsignificant difference in complete blood count indices (25).\r\nWhereas our study demonstrates a statistically significant\r\ndifference in the proportion of children with febrile seizures have\r\nnot only low serum ferritin but also low hemoglobin, low Mean\r\nCorpuscular Volume and low Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin. This\r\nis similar to the findings reported by Naveedur Rehman et al. in his\r\nstudy at Karachi. SUMMARY: 1. The peak incidence of febrile seizures is between one and two\r\nyears of age. The mean age being 23.26 months.\r\n2. A male preponderance is observed in all age groups with male:\r\nfemale ratio of 2:1\r\n3. Family history of febrile seizures is observed in 14% of cases.\r\n4. The mean Serum Ferritin, Hemoglobin and Mean Corpuscular\r\nVolume are significantly lower in children with febrile seizures as\r\ncompared to controls.\r\n5. Significantly, a greater proportion of children with febrile seizures\r\nhave low Serum Ferritin (<12ng/ml); low Hemoglobin (<11gm/dl)\r\nand low Mean Corpuscular Volume (<70fl) as compared to\r\ncontrols. CONCLUSION: Plasma ferritin level and blood indices are significantly lower in\r\nchildren with febrile seizures as compared to children without febrile seizures\r\nsuggesting that iron deficient children are more prone to febrile seizures. A\r\nfollow-up study of patients found to be iron deficient at the time of a first\r\nfebrile seizure to determine the incidence of subsequent febrile seizures after\r\ntreatment for iron deficiency would be of great interest.",

Without hearing rehabilitation, hearing loss can cause detrimental effects on speech, language, developmental, educational, and cognitive outcomes in children. <h3>Observations</h3> Consequences of hearing loss in children include worse outcomes in speech, language, education, social functioning, cognitive abilities, and quality of life. Hearing loss can be congenital, delayed onset, or acquired with possible etiologies including congenital infections, genetic causes including syndromic and nonsyndromic etiologies, and trauma, among others. Evaluation of hearing loss must be based on suspected diagnosis, type, laterality and degree of hearing loss, age of onset, and additional variables such as exposure to cranial irradiation. Hearing rehabilitation for children with hearing loss may include use of hearing aids, cochlear implants, bone anchored devices, or use of assistive devices such as frequency modulating systems. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Hearing loss in children is common, and there has been substantial progress in diagnosis and management of these cases. Early identification of hearing loss and understanding its etiology can assist with prognosis and counseling of families. In addition, awareness of treatment strategies including the many hearing device options, cochlear implant, and assistive devices can help direct management of the patient to optimize outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal enuresis (NE) or bedwetting is the involuntary loss of urine during sleep. It's a common issue, with one in five children in Australia bedwetting. It drops off as the years progress to one in 10 children at 10 years, and one in 30-100 teenagers at 15-17 years. It's a common misconception that bedwetting is caused by a psychological problem; however, most often this is not the case. Often children have an inability to wake to the sensation of a full bladder; it's simply a skill they have not learnt yet. Other factors are constipation, an overactive bladder, poor bladder capacity, nocturnal polyuria, lack of the signal that stops bladder emptying during sleep, obstructive sleep apnoea, family history, and developmental issues. Careful assessment is important. Management needs to be tailored for all children and individual considerations need to be regarded. Some children will continue to wet through to teenage years and beyond into adulthood, although treatment with a continence nurse advisor will help the majority of children to improve or become dry.",

      "abstract": "A series of 33 patients with combined (injurious) sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (viz. \"parasomnia overlap disorder\") was gathered over an 8-year period. Patients underwent clinical and polysomnographic evaluations. Mean age was 34 +/- 14 (SD) years; mean age of parasomnia onset was 15 +/- 16 years (range 1-66); 70% (n = 23) were males. An idiopathic subgroup (n = 22) had a significantly earlier mean age of parasomnia onset (9 +/- 7 years) than a symptomatic subgroup (n = 11) (27 +/- 23 years, p = 0.002), whose parasomnia began with either of the following: neurologic disorders, n = 6 [congenital Mobius syndrome, narcolepsy, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor (and treatment), brain trauma, indeterminate disorder (exaggerated startle response/atypical cataplexy)]; nocturnal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, n = 1; posttraumatic stress disorder/major depression, n = 1; chronic ethanol/amphetamine abuse and withdrawal, n = 1; or mixed disorders (schizophrenia, brain trauma, substance abuse), n = 2. The rate of DSM-III-R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 3rd edition, revised) Axis 1 psychiatric disorders was not elevated; group scores on various psychometric tests were not elevated. Forty-five percent (n = 15) had previously received psychologic or psychiatric therapy for their parasomnia, without benefit. Treatment outcome was available for n = 20 patients; 90% (n = 18) had substantial parasomnia control with bedtime clonazepam (n = 13), alprazolam and/or carbamazepine (n = 4), or self-hypnosis (n = 1). Thus, \"parasomnia overlap disorder\" is a treatable condition that emerges in various clinical settings and can be understood within the context of current knowledge on parasomnias and motor control/dyscontrol during sleep.",

To assess the quality of sleep, it is necessary to be clearly guided by the dynamics of its standards depending on age. Insomnia in children has a number of features compared to adults. Clinical variants of acute and chronic insomnia are associated with stress, childhood somatic pathology, and hyperactivation of the central nervous system. Children with concomitant neuropsychiatric pathology are prone to severe insomnia. The presence of negative associations of falling asleep in the first year of life contributes to the formation of insomnia in young children. In adolescents, insomnia is associated with sleep hygiene disorders and has a psychophysiological character. Treatment of insomnia in children includes normalization of sleep hygiene, the use of behavioral therapy methods, and prescribing pharmaceutical drugs with age restrictions. The safety profile plays a fundamental role in the drug therapy of childhood insomnia.",

      "title": "Night Shift Naps Improve Patient and Workforce Safety",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is the body’s natural response to sleep loss.1 Interruption in the quantity or quality of sleep affects fatigue,2 which in turn disrupts physical and cognitive functioning. Fatigue not only impairs attention to detail, ability to remain focused, information processing/judgment, and problem-solving, but also memory, reaction time, motivation, communication, mood, and empathy.3–5Many factors contribute to fatigue. Topping the list are staffing and workload demands, scheduling (ie, shift length, rotations, consecutive and overtime shifts), and personal issues such as habits and family responsibilities.2,6 In particular, extended shifts (&gt; 8 hours) have been associated with greater fatigue, drowsiness at work, and need for recovery.7,8 Fatigued nurses are at higher risk of making errors6,9,10 (risk increases 3-fold if shifts are &gt; 12.5 hours),11 burnout,12 and work-related injuries and accidents.10 Patient satisfaction also suffers.12 In another systematic review of 21 studies,8 as shift lengthened, adverse outcomes for patients increased (eg, hypoglycemic events, pneumonia, death), and nurses experienced more occupational injuries such as needle stick and musculoskeletal injuries, health complaints, drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes or near crashes.8 In an attempt to assess a countermeasure for fatigue, the PICO (patient/problem, intervention, comparison, outcome) question of interest for this evidence synthesis was, What effect do strategic naps have on sleep and cognitive/psychomotor outcomes of nurses?The search strategy involved CINAHL and MEDLINE. Key words were fatigue, nurses, health care workers, hospitals, and napping. The search was limited to the past 10 years.Ten original research studies were retrieved (Table 1): 3 qualitative, 1 participatory action, 2 descriptive, 1 quasi-experimental, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 1 systematic review. All studies examined the effects of naps on hospital nurses working the night shift, except for the systematic review, which related to shift workers across industries. In most instances, a single nap was studied, but researchers in one study22 examined nightly naps over 3 consecutive nights. Length of naps varied from 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes to 1, 2, and 3 hours. Nap times were highly variable from midnight to 1 am, 2 am to 3 am, and 4 am to 4:30 am.As outlined in Table 1, quantitative and qualitative studies validated that strategic naps rejuvenate nurses. More than 50% of nurses who napped in one study13 could sleep (albeit lightly). Sleep latency, or time to fall asleep, was shortest for nurses who napped from 2 am to 3 am.16 But some nurses had difficulty calming down and unplugging because they wanted to stay informed as patient care was top priority.21 If unable to nap, nurses reported that 4 am to 6 am was the most difficult period for drowsiness.18Nappers reported feeling “energized” and “refreshed,”13,18,21 and sleep inertia (ie, drowsiness and impaired cognitive/psychomotor performance upon awakening) occurred less often.13,18 Another study demonstrated physiological signs of reduced tension from sleeping, including changes in bispectral measures, body temperature, heart rate variability, and activity level.15 Sleep outcomes from napping included less subjective and behavioral signs of sleepiness, and increased vigor.16,19,22 Scott et al19 found that the amount of sleep on workdays improved by 50 minutes on average, and sleep quality improved significantly at 12 weeks. Compared with those who did not nap, nappers also experienced fewer performance lapses, better probed memory recall, faster reaction times, less drowsy driving and better driving performance, faster psychomotor skills during intravenous catheter insertion, and fewer errors or near errors.16,19,22 Intercepted or discovered errors increased because of higher alertness.Most of the evidence for strategic napping to combat detrimental effects of fatigue is level C evidence (Table 2). Strategic naps were rejuvenating with favorable cognitive and psychomotor functions, which led to fewer errors. The timing and duration of naps are important. Naps that occur after the middle of the night (but before 4 am)18,24 promoted better sleep quality and were associated with greater physiological benefit and psychomotor performance. Naps should also not last more than 1 hour25 to prevent sleep inertia, or 30 minutes should be allowed for recovery.18,22Several implications must be considered when developing strategic napping programs. Educating nurses about the effects of fatigue and good self-care—including taking naps before working a night shift or a prolonged stretch—is essential.2 The need for this education to be a higher priority was demonstrated by a recent survey24 where most nurse leaders indicated that their facilities did not educate either managers or staff on risk management issues related to fatigue.26A second consideration relates to assessing the conduciveness of the environment for sleeping. Good quality sleep is more likely if nurses can take a duty-free break with uninterrupted coverage of their responsibilities.2 Nurses in a qualitative study18 provided many reasons for their inabilities to nap— from understaffing to unstable patients. When staffing is an issue, Geiger-Brown et al13 advocated that naps should be offered to nurses with (1) self-perceived sleepiness or shiftwork sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea, insomnia), (2) commutes more than 20 minutes or on rural roads, and (3) rotating (vs fixed) shifts, especially those working their first shift or more than 3 in a row.In addition to acuity and staffing issues, Fallis et al18 reported other barriers to napping. These barriers centered on lack of comfortable spaces, interruptions due to shared space, and fear of sleep inertia. In a recent survey of critical care managers, only 11% reported that a specific nap room was available.27 In another study,20 nurses were challenged by the lack of a predefined nap time and consistent ability to take time to rest. Because of these challenges, nurses have shared preferences such as desire for a staff-exclusive area close to the unit (but separate from break rooms) that offers low lighting, pillows and blankets, timers, and either beds, couches, stretchers, or reclining chairs.18,21 Eye masks and ear plugs also may be helpful.2To compound these challenges, cultural barriers exist. Nurse managers in one study18 were surprised by the ease of implementing a napping program, but they stated that the professional/organizational culture and staff’s perceptual dissonance about the adequacy of staffing affected their ability to take restful breaks. Indeed, staff nurses and managers themselves have alluded to lack of support for napping from managers and senior leaders.18,27 Many nurses are reticent to take naps5 and feel guilty if they do.21 In a current survey, Steege et al26 found that although most nurse leaders recognized fatigue as a significant practice concern with negative consequences, most believed that stigma surrounds acknowledging fatigue because it is “part of the culture of nursing.” Thus, leaders concluded that these social norms have slowed the triggering of organizational priorities toward developing fatigue-management policies that include napping, as advocated for by the American Nurses Association.28Fatigue. Errors. Burnout. Occupational injuries. Adverse outcomes for patients. Drowsy driving. Health complaints. Workplace accidents. Mortality. Patient dissatisfaction. Motor vehicle crashes.

Sleep initiation, sleep maintenance and terminal insomnia with unrefreshed sleep and disturbing dreams have been consistently reported in the studies of adults with MDD. Hypersomnia has been reported in a subset of adult depressives. Although sleep disturbances may be present throughout all phases of a depressive disorder, they are most severe during an acute episode. Patients with depression who report sleep disturbances are more likely to attempt suicide than those who do not report difficulties with their sleep. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep to such a degree that patients may have vegetative symptoms of depression. Thus, it is important when assessing a depressed patient with sleep difficulties to consider a thorough sleep assessment to rule out a physiological cause of vegetative symptoms of depression and insomnia. Those with depression who also exhibit sleep disturbance can benefit from behavioral and relaxation training (1).",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders, a common concern in modern society, seriously affect people's physical and mental health. Reported findings suggest that both acute exercise intervention and long-term regular exercise intervention can improve the disrupted sleep structure and normalize the duration and proportion of the different phases of sleep. Moreover, exercise intervention has a positive effect on the endocrine functions, the metabolic functions, the immune response, the autonomic nervous system, and cardiac functions during sleep. It is a non-medicative therapeutic strategy for improving sleep disorders. The specific type of exercise intervention (aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or meditative movement) adopted is one of the moderating variables of exercise intervention programs. Different types of exercise improve sleep disorders by way of different mechanisms. Exercise volume and intensity are another moderating variable of exercise intervention programs. The optimal amount and intensity of exercise for different individuals to improve sleep disorders may vary. Exercise interventions implemented at the different times throughout a day can also have varying degrees of impact on sleep disorders and there is no consensus on the optimal exercise time for improving sleep quality at present. Herein, we summarized the mechanisms by which exercise intervention improves sleep disorders from four perspectives, including epigenetics, hyperarousal, human circadian rhythm, and body temperature regulation. In addition, we discussed the current gaps and prospects of research in this field, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the development of exercise prescriptions for sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Therapeutics for the Treatment of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

      "abstract": "The four main requirements for oral-motor development are stability and mobility of the ingestive system, rhythmicity, sensation, oral-motor efficiency and economy. Ingestion can be divided into oral, pharyngeal and esophageal stages. The main categories of pathology encountered in our swallowing and dysphagia clinic are encephalopathies (including cerebral palsy), genetic disorders (including chromosomal aberrations), syndromes associated with swallowing difficulty (e.g. Rett, Dandy-Walker, DiGeorge), head injuries, brain tumors, developmental delay and the oral deprivation syndrome (e.g. due to prolonged tube feeding on a preterm infant). The behavioral expression of the many different pathologies falls into three categories: (1) resistance to accepting food orally; (2) lack of energy and endurance to do the 'work' of eating; and (3) oral-motor disabilities resulting in an inability to produce the necessary motor skills for ingestion. Expect expression and exacerbation of feeding problems during periods of most active growth, i.e. from birth to 2 years and during the adolescent growth spurt. Identify the source of the feeding problem. Establish its pathology and note the clinical manifestations. Determine if the problem has a strictly physiologic origin or whether it may be exacerbated by the feeding interaction between child and feeder. Determine what diagnostic tests are needed and refer child for testing Formulate the treatment approach based on clinical observations and results of diagnostic tests. Teach and monitor treatment which can be given by caregivers. Set time limits for treatment and clearly state expected results. Evaluate progress by comparing outcome to stated treatment objectives. Refer children with more severe problems to a multidisciplinary treatment team.",

Three patients developed RBD after acute inflammatory encephalitis, which lasted for 3 months to 1 year. They talked, moved and walked nightly while asleep. During night polysomnography, there were REM sleep without atonia and abnormally increased REM sleep as 37â87% of total sleep. The RBD improved with clonazepam and there was no recurrence at 1 year follow-up. The global encephalitis could be responsible for the RBD and destruction of sleep architecture.

Several studies on the impact and importance of sleep problems on quality of life in patients on dialysis revealed that sleep disturbances have a major effect on the vitality and general health of these patients [2]. Sleep disturbances in patients on dialysis might be caused by both the pathology of the renal disease and the dialysis treatment itself [3]. Although sleep disorders found in this population can be complex—for example, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and periodic limb movement disorder can cause sleep problems for patients—this chapter will focus on disturbances in the circadian sleep–wake rhythm. Focusing on these disturbances is a novel field of interest in this patient population, but such disturbances can have a prominent role in the development of sleep disorders, and therefore in impairment of quality of life, in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). An overview of circadian sleep–wake rhythm, the scope of the problem regarding sleep disturbances in this population, the role of melatonin, possible external and internal influences on sleep–wake rhythmicity in patients with ESRD, and possible approaches for strengthening the synchronization of the circadian sleep–wake rhythm will be explored in the following sections.",

It may be associated to behavioural and cognitive alterations such as learning and memory disorders or problems with attention, even in the milder forms of the disorder. Our aim is to review the clinical manifestations of sleep-disordered breathing in early childhood, focusing on the neurocognitive and behavioural deficits, as well as the pathophysiological mechanisms involved. Sleep-disordered breathing produces alterations to a greater or lesser extent in the children's cognitive and behavioural functioning, regardless of the severity of the breathing disorder. There is evidence to show that these manifestations can be reversible when early and effective treatment is carried out. It is therefore important to enquire specifically about children's sleep and daytime behaviour, with special emphasis on the presence of snoring because even when it is resolved, there is an increased long-term risk of conduct disorders during the day. Trastornos respiratorios del sueño en la infancia: repercusiones neurocognitivas.Los trastornos respiratorios durante el sueño en la infancia incluyen un amplio espectro que comprende desde el ronquido primario hasta las formas mas graves de sindrome de apnea obstructiva del sueño.

Nuestro objetivo es revisar las manifestaciones clinicas de los trastornos respiratorios durante el sueño en la infancia, centrandonos en los deficits neurocognitivos y conductuales, ademas de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos implicados. Los trastornos respiratorios del sueño producen alteraciones en mayor o menor medida en el funcionamiento cognitivo y conductual en los niños, independientemente de la gravedad del trastorno respiratorio. Existe evidencia de la reversibilidad de estas manifestaciones cuando se realiza un tratamiento precoz y efectivo, por lo que es importante preguntar especificamente sobre el sueño y el comportamiento diurno de los niños, haciendo especial hincapie en la presencia de ronquido porque incluso cuando se resuelve, aumenta el riesgo a largo plazo de trastornos de conducta durante el dia.",

      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

But as its features become more widely known it is likely to be increasingly recognized. It occurs in children of Jewish parentage, the majority of cases being reported from the U.S.A., with one from South America (Tyndel, 1955), and some from Montreal (Riley, 1955). The constant symptoms comprise: defective lachrymation (“crying without tears”); symmetrical, blotchy erythema following emotional disturbances or eating; excessive sweating; sialorrhoea; emotional lability; poor motor coordination; relative indifference to pain; and hypo- or areflexia. Inconstant symptoms are: intermittent hypertension; periodic vomiting which may threaten life; liability to respiratory diseases; frequent unexplained bouts of pyrexia; attacks of apnoea during the first year of life; corneal ulceration; orthopaedic changes (scoliosis, pes cavus); and epileptiform convulsions (Riley, 1952). The condition is familial, apparently being inherited as a simple recessive trait (Riley et al. , 1954), though an irregular dominant is a possibility (St. Martin, 1953).",

      "title": "Sleep-related epilepsies in the course of development in childhood",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy, as one of the most prevalent neurological diseases in childhood, has a strong reciprocal relationship with sleep. Sleep-associated epilepsy syndromes in childhood are mostly genetic and can be divided into (a) the group of self-limited focal epilepsies of childhood including self-limited epilepsy with autonomic seizures (SeLEAS) and self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS) and (b) (non-self-limited) sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE). Sleep-accentuated (developmental and) epileptic encephalopathies (DEE/EE-SWAS, Landau–Kleffner syndrome [LKS]) are either genetic (possible transition from SeLEAS or SeLECTS) or structural, and they are characterized by continuous bilateral focal or generalized epileptic activity throughout the night with a clinical manifestation of stagnation or regression, in particular of cognition (verbal agnosia in LKS). Epilepsy syndromes with increased seizure frequency after sleep deprivation or with seizures in the transition to awakening include juvenile generalized epilepsy syndromes such as epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (GTCA) or juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), but also SeLECTS. Sleep is a very active process: Regeneration, reorganization, and consolidation of memory facilitate development and cognitive functioning. Epilepsy can alter sleep architecture and vice versa, which can appear as a vicious circle in epilepsies that are sleep related. Macrostructural elements of sleep such as sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wakefulness after sleep onset, REM and non-REM sleep fraction, as well as microstructural sleep elements such as slow-wave activity, slope of slow waves, cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), and physiological sleep figures, are important biomarkers with which to understand clinical symptoms such as cognitive stagnation and regression, to monitor treatment, but also to determine prognostic factors and will be an important tool for future studies.",

      "abstract": ": There is an increasing number of patients worldwide with sleep disturbances and diabetes. Various sleep disorders, including long or short sleep duration and poor sleep quality of numerous causes, may increase the risk of diabetes. Some symptoms of diabetes, such as painful peripheral neuropathy and nocturia, or associated other sleep disorders, such as sleep breathing disorders or sleep movement disorders, may influence sleep quality and quantity. Both sleep disorders and diabetes may lead to cognitive impairment. The risk of development of cognitive impairment in diabetic patients may be related to vascular and non-vascular and other factors, such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, central insulin resistance, amyloid and tau deposits and other causes. Numerous sleep disorders, e.g., sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, and poor sleep quality are most likely are also associated with cognitive impairment. Adequate functioning of the system of clearance of the brain from toxic substances, such as amyloid β, i.e. glymphatic system, is related to undisturbed sleep and prevents cognitive impairment. In the case of coexistence, sleep disturbances and diabetes either independently lead to and/or mutually aggravate cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib or cot death are synonyms for the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant. The incidence of SIDS has been estimated to be from 1-2% to 3%. Protracted intrauterine hypoxia or recurrent hypoxic insults during fetal life undoubtedly influence the development of the central nervous structures as a tissue most susceptible to hypoxia, although well developed mechanisms of defense against hypoxia exist during the fetal life. The mechanisms underlying SIDS include neurologically compromised infants who are deprived of compensatory mechanisms during sleep, sustaining a hypoxic insult with alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within the regions involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. Changes in the brain result from perinatal prolonged hypoxia (persistent reticular pathways in the pons and medulla, astroglia in the brainstem, gliosis of brain nerve nuclei, defects in neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal apoptosis, microthrombosis, and hypoxic ischemic lesion). Hypoxic perinatal risk factors for SIDS included passive and active exposure to cigarette smoking in pregnancy, abuse of drugs, alcohol, coffee and medication in pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal hypoxia with or without resuscitation, preeclampsia, anemia in pregnancy, prematurity, multiparity, multiple pregnancy, pregnant women aged < 20 years and > 35 years, cardiocirculatory, pulmonary and endocrine diseases in pregnancy, and short time interval between two pregnancies. As cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to lead to fetoplacental insufficiency, which result in fetal hypoxia, it is concluded that hypoxia is a precondition for the occurrence of SIDS. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke decreases maternal red blood cell count, and concentrations of tyrosine and selenium, reduces fetal and neonatal cerebral blood flow, and increases maternal MCV, leukocytosis, especially neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, maternal and fetal heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resistance index in umbilical artery, fetal hemoglobin, cytokine, serotonine, dopamine, catecholamine, hypoxanthine, endorphin and interleukin-6. Pregnancy at a risk of hypoxia, especially in heavy smokers, is a major risk factor for SIDS, and such pregnancy requires close and intensive antenatal monitoring.",

      "abstract": "The bedtime of preschoolers/pupils/students in Japan has become progressively later with the result sleep duration has become progressively shorter. With these changes, more than half of the preschoolers/pupils/students in Japan recently have complained of daytime sleepiness, while approximately one quarter of junior and senior high school students in Japan reportedly suffer from insomnia. These preschoolers/pupils/students may be suffering from behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome due to inadequate sleep hygiene. If this diagnosis is correct, they should be free from these complaints after obtaining sufficient sleep by avoiding inadequate sleep hygiene. However, such a therapeutic approach often fails. Although social factors are often involved in these sleep disturbances, a novel clinical notion – asynchronization – can further a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of these disturbances. The essence of asynchronization is a disturbance in various aspects (e.g., cycle, amplitude, phase and interrelationship) of the biological rhythms that normally exhibit circadian oscillation, presumably involving decreased activity of the serotonergic system. The major trigger of asynchronization is hypothesized to be a combination of light exposure during the night and a lack of light exposure in the morning. In addition to basic principles of morning light and an avoidance of nocturnal light exposure, presumable potential therapeutic approaches for asynchronization involve both conventional ones (light therapy, medications (hypnotics, antidepressants, melatonin, vitamin B12), physical activation, chronotherapy) and alternative ones (kampo, pulse therapy, direct contact, control of the autonomic nervous system, respiration (qigong, tanden breathing), chewing, crawling). A morning-type behavioral preference is described in several of the traditional textbooks for good health. The author recommends a morning-type behavioral lifestyle as a way to reduce behavioral/emotional problems, and to lessen the likelihood of falling into asynchronization.",

Patients with disturbances of circadian rhythm find themselves unable to shift their sleep/wake cycle to adapt to the schedule requirements of work, school, and/or family life. In delayed sleep phase syndrome, patients may experience “sleep drunkenness” upon awakening, with confusion, disorientation, and impaired motor coordination. Generally individuals suffer with disturbances of circadian rhythm for years before getting treatment. Treatment approaches often involve a carefully planned, gradual shifting of sleep time and the use of melatonin as well as the bright light therapy that are timed carefully, depending on the clinical situation. The control of the sleep/wake cycle is complex. It is affected by the genetic factors, maintained by neurologic and hormonal systems, and responsive to external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Drivers' sleepiness and falling asleep while driving account for a considerable proportion of vehicle accidents (studies show different results from 1% to 30%). Sleepiness is rarely well recognised as a causing factor of traffic accidents. 2.5% up to 20% people suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) with sleep deprivation as its most frequent cause. There is a strong association between sleep deprivation and medical problems--especially sleep disturbances. The sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) has been identified as the most common cause of habitual drowsy driving. Patients with SAS (apart from other health problems) are 6 times more likely to have accidents. After adequate treatment of severe SAS with continuous positive airway pressure the risk of accident lowered 5 x. Other important sleep disturbances include chronic insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement in sleep. Sleepiness was described in Parkinson's disease, dementia, epilepsy, in chronic cardiacs and in people with complex internal health problems. Regular or single intake of drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistaminics, antipsychotics and others) can itself induce sleep problems. Sleepiness in persons without sleep disorder may occur due to preventable causes such as poor sleep habits which lead to sleep deprivation.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a widespread disorder affecting not only sleep quantity and quality, but also daytime well-being and performance, as well as having a negative impact on physical and mental health. Many people have problems falling asleep and maintaining sleep that do not reach the clinical criteria of insomnia. For all the prevalence of such sleep disorders, specialists often overlook a fundamentally important factor that affects sleep and wakefulness cycle, ease of falling asleep and daytime performance. These are circadian rhythms of the body under the control of the biological clock.This review highlights the specifics of the human biological clock and its relationship to insomnia and complaints of poor sleep. The phenomenon of the human chronotype as a set of individual preferences in sleep-wake rhythm is considered. Late chronotype, tat tends to wake up late and be active in the evening turns out to be the most vulnerable to the appearance of complaints of poor sleep and development of insomnia. This result is typical for different age groups. The reason for problems sleep for the late chronotype is the need to adjust to social demands and to fall asleep and wake up too early relative to the phase of one’s own circadian rhythm.Circadian rhythms may contribute to the formation and maintenance of insomnia. Both chronic and acute insomnia may have a chronobiological component that is not always considered. Late chronotype may be a factor further exacerbating the course of insomnia. The regularity of circadian rhythms may also be impaired in insomnia.The importance of the biological clock in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness also explains the successful approach to insomnia treatment with melatonin, which plays an important signaling role in the circadian regulation of the body.",

      "abstract": "Background: Hyperlexia is the phenomenon of spontaneous and precocious mastery of single‐word reading that has been of interest to clinicians and researchers since the beginning of the last century. Methods: An extensive search of publications on the subject of hyperlexia was undertaken and all available publications were reviewed. Results: The literature can be subdivided into discussions of the following issues: (1) whether hyperlexia is a phenomenon that is characteristic only of specific clinical populations (e.g., children with developmental delays) or whether it can also be observed in the general population; (2) whether hyperlexia is a distinct syndrome comorbid with a number of different disorders or whether it is a part of the spectrum of some other clinical condition(s); (3) whether hyperlexia should be defined through single‐word reading superiority with regard to reading comprehension, vocabulary, general intelligence, any combination of the three, or all three characteristics; (4) whether there is a specific neuropsychological profile associated with hyperlexia; (5) whether hyperlexia is characterized by a particular developmental profile; and (6) whether hyperlexia should be viewed as a disability (deficit) or superability (talent). Conclusions: We interpret the literature as supporting the view that hyperlexia is a superability demonstrated by a very specific group of individuals with developmental disorders (defined through unexpected single‐word reading in the context of otherwise suppressed intellectual functioning) rather than as a disability exhibited by a portion of the general population (defined through a discrepancy between levels of single‐word reading and comprehension). We simultaneously argue, however, that multifaceted and multi‐methodological approaches to studying the phenomenon of hyperlexia, defined within the research framework of understanding single‐word reading, are warranted and encouraged.",

      "title": "Sleep-wake abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis",
      "abstract": "A considerable proportion of patients with cirrhosis exhibit insomnia, delayed sleep habits, and excessive daytime sleepiness. These have been variously attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and impaired hepatic melatonin metabolism, but the understanding of their pathophysiology remains limited and their treatment problematic. Sleep is regulated by the interaction of a homeostatic and a circadian process. The homeostatic process determines sleep propensity in relation to sleep-wake history, thus the need to sleep increases with the duration of the waking period. The circadian process, which is marked by the 24-hour rhythm of the hormone melatonin, is responsible for the alternation of high/low sleep propensity in relation to dark/light cues. Circadian sleep regulation has been studied in some depth in patients with cirrhosis, who show delays in the 24-hour melatonin rhythm, most likely in relation to reduced sensitivity to light cues. However, while melatonin abnormalities are associated with delayed sleep habits, they do not seem to offer a comprehensive explanation to the insomnia exhibited by these patients. Fewer data are available on homeostatic sleep control: it has been recently hypothesized that patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy might be unable, due to excessive daytime sleepiness, to accumulate the need/ability to produce restorative sleep. This review will describe in some detail the features of sleep-wake disturbances in patients with cirrhosis, their mutual relationships, and those, if any, with hepatic failure/hepatic encephalopathy. A separate section will cover the available information on their pathophysiology. Finally, etiological treatment will be briefly discussed.",

Several types of experiments indicate that alterations in the timing of sleep and wakefulness relative to other circadian rhythms (i.e., changes in internal phase relationships) may trigger the onset or offset of episodes of depression and mania. Whether drugs used to treat manic-depressive illness act through their effects on the circadian system is currently being investigated.

      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases affecting the respiratory system are usually present during the day and the night; however, sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome is a disease manifesting only during sleep. It is defined as a cessation (apnea) or a reduction of breathing (hypopnea) of 10 seconds or more during sleep. Each of these apneas or hypopneas is usually terminated when the person awakens for a few seconds. Typically, patients do not remember these transient awakenings. There are two general categories of apnea: central and obstructive. These categories are classified according to the presence or the absence of respiratory effort. Central sleep apnea is a result of the absence of nerve impulses from the brain to the respiratory muscles and therefore occurs in absence of respiratory effort. Obstructive sleep apnea is much more common. This condition is caused by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway (pharynx) during sleep. Therefore, respiratory efforts are still present during apnea and usually increase throughout the apnea. The individual makes larger and larger respiratory efforts until they arouse from sleep apnea and reopen their upper airway so breathing can resume. As will be discussed, some overlap exists between obstructive and central apnea in both disease presentation (so‐called mixed apnea) and in pathogenesis.",

      "title": "“Infantile Colic” as the Sole Manifestation of Gastroesophageal Reflux",
      "abstract": "“Infantile colic” is a colloquial term that is used to designate frequent prolonged bouts of fussing, crying, restlessness, and increased motor activity for no apparent reason, in an otherwise healthy infant (1). Tradition has it that “infantile colic” tends to improve and disappear after 3-4 months of age, but in reality the condition is also noted to persist well into the second half of the 1 st year of life (2). A variety of conditions have been proposed to cause the clinical array that is labeled “infantile colic,” among them intrafamilial problems (3), malabsorption of sugar(s) (4), cow's milk protein allergy (5), neuroendocrine factors (6), depending on the specific viewpoint from which the condition is studied, and the modes of treatment vary accordingly. Bouts of crying, irritability, and restlessness can also be manifested by infants who have pathological gastroesophageal reflux (GER) (7). From accruing experience with lower esophageal pH monitoring, it has emerged that pathological GER can exist without overt evidence of regurgitation, vomiting, or respiratory disturbances (“silent” reflux), while still causing esophagitis (8), and evoking episodes of bitter crying and restlessness that may be construed as reflecting “infantile colic.” In effect, in the course of our experience with esophageal pH monitoring, we detected significant GER in infants whose sole clinical manifestations were episodes of fussing, crying, and restlessness, which had been diagnosed by the primary physician as “infantile colic.” We therefore undertook to perform esophageal pH studies in a prospective series of babies with a presumptive diagnosis of “infantile colic” that was severe and persistent enough to induce referral to our Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-six consecutive babies, ages 2-9 months, had been labeled as having “infantile colic,” which featured daily prolonged episodes of bitter crying, with irritability, restlessness, and increased motor activity that included drawing up of the legs and stamping movements. The events went on for more than 4 weeks, and had not responded to parental reassurance, dietary manipulations, defoaming agents and herbal teas. There had been no deviation from normal health and development, and no apparent source for the distress. After a detailed history and physical examination, 24-h esophageal pH monitoring was performed with a pH-sensitive electrode placed 4 cm proximal to the lower esophageal sphincter and connected to a Digitrapper MK III recording and digitizing device (Synectics AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The test was performed and interpreted in accordance with the guidelines of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (9). Informed written consent was obtained from the parents. Infants whose pH-metry indicated significant GER (9), primarily by a finding of esophageal pH < 4 for longer than the upper percentile value for age (9), received oral treatment with cisapride (0.2 mg/kg, q.i.d.) and cimetidine (10 mg/kg, b.i.d.). Cisapride was given throughout the 3 months of follow-up and beyond, whereas cimetidine was discontinued after 4 weeks. The infants with GER were followed up during a period of 3 months, by daily event-reports handed in by the parents every 10 days, and a monthly evaluation of the infants during a visit at the outpatient clinic. RESULTS Of the 26 infants, 14 were male and 12 were female. Their ages ranged between 2 and 9 months (median 4.8 months), and the age at onset of the symptoms was 3 weeks to 4 months (median 1.8 months). The time from onset of symptoms to performance of pH-metry ranged between 5 weeks and 6 months, and had been longer than 2 months in 21 of the infants. Pathological GER was detected by pH-metry in 16 of the 26 infants (61.5%) (Table 1). Treatment with cisapride and cimetidine of these 16 infants, who were referred with a presumptive diagnosis of “infantile colic” but were found to have pathological GER, induced a reduction in the frequency and in the severity of the events within 5 days in 12 of the infants, whereas after 14 days of treatment all the infants with GER were free of any symptom that could be regarded as a manifestation of “infantile colic.” In the remaining 10 infants, those who did not have GER on pH-metry, the picture of “infantile colic” gradually resolved over a period of 4-6 weeks, throughout which family-intervention measures were continued. DISCUSSION The pattern of the clinical constellation that is termed “infantile colic” tends to be fairly stereotypic, in spite of the diversity of conditions that have been proposed as causative agents. A specific cause cannot be discerned in most instances of genuine(?) “infantile colic.” The initial therapeutic measures that the primary physician will undertake are largely influenced by the contention that overproduction of gas by malabsorbed sugars (4) and food allergies (5) are major causes of “infantile colic,” and will most often consist of parental reassurance and dietary manipulation, perhaps with the addition of a defoaming agent such as simethicone, which has been shown to be no more effective than placebo (10). Our study indicates that the differential diagnosis of “infantile colic” should include GER, which can manifest solely as bouts of crying and restlessness, in the absence of any of the other clinical features that are traditionally associated with GER. In our series of 26 infants, who were studied by esophageal pH monitoring while they were having only attacks of crying and restlessness that were labeled “infantile colic,” 16 (61%) were found to have significant GER. The administration of medications that are recommended for the management of GER disease, namely, H2 block-age (cimetidine) and a prokinetic drug (cisapride) (11), induced a dramatic improvement and disappearance of the “colic” features within 5-14 days. GER that causes symptoms is pathological, and requires appropriate therapy that will allay the symptoms, reduce reflux, heal the esophagitis, and prevent long-term complications (11). We are aware that our series consists of selected patients whose seemed to be refractory to the usual therapies, and that our observations are not based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We are also aware that “infantile colic” may resolve spontaneously with time. However, we may regard our group of infants with GER as being their own controls, inasmuch as the rapidity of resolution of their “infantile colic” following initiation of anti-reflux therapy is strongly suggestive of a putative role for GER in evoking the repeated episodes of inconsolable crying and restlessness. We conclude from our observations, that GER can fully mimic the clinical array termed “infantile colic.” Awareness of this association is warranted in view of the damaging potential of pathological GER that is left untreated (8). It might even be justified to propose that severe “infantile colic” be managed by addressing the possibility of GER, whereas other modes of treatment become warranted if no improvement is apparent after 10 days of antireflux medication.",

In settings associated with litigation/disability evaluation, the rate of malingering may be as high as 30%, but its frequency in clinical practice is not known. We describe the main characteristics of deliberate deception (factitious disorders and malingering) and ways that neurologists might detect symptom exaggeration. The key to establishing that the extent or severity of reported symptoms does not truly represent their severity is to elicit inconsistencies in different domains, but it is not possible to determine whether the reports are intentionally inaccurate. Neurological disorders where difficulty in determining the degree of willed exaggeration is most likely include functional weakness and movement disorders, post-concussional syndrome (or mild traumatic brain injury), psychogenic non-epileptic attacks and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (especially when there is an associated functional movement disorder). Symptom amplification or even fabrication are more likely if the patient might gain benefit of some sort, not necessarily financial. Techniques to detect deception in medicolegal settings include covert surveillance and review of social media accounts. We also briefly describe specialised psychological tests designed to elicit effort from the patient.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within rapid-eye-movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep, or during arousals from sleep. Parasomnias encompass abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Also, instinctual behaviors can be involuntarily and pathologically released with the parasomnias, including sexual behaviors (sexsomnia), aggression, locomotion, and eating. The clinical consequences of a parasomnia can affect the patient, the bed partner, and any nearby individual. Sexsomnia is classified as a variant of confusional arousals (and sleepwalking), an NREM parasomnia, with amnesia for the sexual behaviors virtually always reported. The cumulative world published literature on sexsomnia consists of 220 cases, 84% males and predominant age in the 30s and 40s. Most cases were identified as NREM parasomnias, although obstructive sleep apnea was the identified trigger in 10.4% of cases. Various other triggers were identified. Forensic consequences were reported in 15 of the reported clinical cases. Sleep medicine physicians can expect inquiries from attorneys to solicit their involvement in criminal trials as forensic implications of parasomnias become increasingly more apparent. As courts generally have an implicit bias that is not favorable to the “sleepwalking defense,” sleep medicine physicians who take on the mantle of an expert medical witness should define their role and understand that supporting justice in the courtroom can only be optimally done through a strong collaborative effort with the attorney throughout the legal process.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a condition characterized by subjective complaints of insufficient sleep and poor daytime functioning. Objective measures of sleep and daytime functioning, however, seldom show evidence of a similar degree of dysfunction. Most insomniacs, for example, do not suffer from sleep deprivation or daytime sleepiness. This discrepancy between subjective and objective measures of sleep and daytime functioning suggests that cognitive factors may play a central role in persistent insomnia. In particular, it is argued that fears about insufficient sleep and its adverse daytime consequences tend to interfere with sleep, thereby causing a vicious cycle which serves to maintain the insomnia. It is also argued that perfectionist standards and other dysfunctional beliefs may predispose people to these kinds of fears. Finally, existing models for cognitive-behavioural treatment of insomnia are criticized for being almost exclusively focused on the night-time aspects of insomnia. If insomnia is maintained by various kinds of vicious cycles involving fears, beliefs, and standards with regard to daytime functioning, these daytime aspects of insomnia should receive more attention in cognitive-behavioural treatment.

Supporting evidence: (1) lack of 5-hydroxitryptamine, one consistent finding in sudden infant death syndrome that Kinney et al coined a developmental serotonopathy, is consistent with risk for seizures. (2) Non–rapid eye movement sleep increasing during the age of highest risk for sudden infant death syndrome facilitates some seizures (seizure gate). (3) Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is associated with severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia during postictal generalized electroencephalographic (EEG) suppression. In toddlers, sudden unexplained deaths are associated with hippocampal abnormalities and some seizures. (4) The sudden nature of both deaths warrants an exploration of similarities in the terminal pathway. Moreover, sudden infant death syndrome, febrile seizures, sudden unexplained death in childhood, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy share some of the following risk factors: prone sleeping, infections, hyperthermia, preterm birth, male gender, maternal smoking, and mutations in genes that regulate sodium channels. State-of-the-art molecular studies can be exploited to test this hypothesis.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

      "abstract": "Background  Disordered sleep is a common and often lifelong problem among people with ID. Settling problems, excessive daytime sleepiness, night waking problems, and sleep apnoea are some of the most common sleep problems that adults and children with ID experience. There is considerable evidence to suggest that sleep problems are highly associated with a number of problematic factors in the individuals themselves, their first line carers (i.e. mothers) and their families as a whole. Insufficient sleep has been highly associated with increases in aggression, self injury and property destruction.  Improving sleep and providing successful treatment for individuals with ID can benefit the families and alleviate, if not reverse these trends.  Aims: 1. To assess the efficacy of psychological sleep treatment techniques, such as extinction and sleep hygiene, for severe sleep disorders in adults with ID using a RCT design. 2. To assess changes in the adults’ daytime behaviour in relation to psychological sleep treatment.",

      "abstract": "Disordered sleep is strongly linked to future depression, but the reasons for this link are not well understood. This study tested one possibility - that poorer sleep impairs emotion regulation (ER), which over time leads to increased depressive symptoms. Our sample contained individuals with a wide range of depression symptoms (current depression, N = 54, remitted depression, N = 36, and healthy control, N = 53), who were followed clinically over six months and reassessed for changes in depressive symptom levels. As predicted, maladaptive ER mediated both cross-sectional and prospective relationships between poor sleep quality and depression symptoms. In contrast, an alternative mediator, physical activity levels, did not mediate the link between sleep quality and depression symptoms. Maladaptive ER may help explain why sleep difficulties contribute to depression symptoms; implications for interventions are discussed.",

Many individuals with SRED have coexisting sleep disorders that cause partial nighttime arousals.

Individuals with SRED may present with complaints of excessive daytime fatigue, multiple nighttime sleep disruptions, and/or weight gain. The onset of SRED is generally in adolescence or young adulthood but may be during childhood or midlife. Prognosis is dependent on identifying and effectively managing any coexisting primary sleep disorder and/or medical disorder. Medication for the treatment of SRED has led to considerable success. A variety of psychotropic medications are reported to precipitate SRED, especially zolpidem (Ambien).",

      "abstract": "Disturbances of the sleep-wake pattern constitute one of the major complaints of patients with a wide range of psychiatric conditions, including major depression disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, eating disorders, and alcohol abuse. Recent advances have cast light on the mecanisms underlying modifications in sleep in psychiatric disorders, offering new approaches in management and opening new avenues of research. Isnomnia and psychiatric disorders, especially depression, are intimately linked. Insomnia, defined as a difficulty in initiating and/or in maintaining sleep leading to daytime repercussions, is not simply a symptom of depression but an independent diagnostic entity, and is known to be an independent risk factor for both depression itself and the development of a new depression episode or relapse. To date, the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the relationships between insomnia and affective disorders are not yet fully understood. The review by Chiara Baglioni et al. examines the latest findings from several fields of research, with particular attention to alterations of the arousal system leading to hyperarousal and to the possible biological mechanisms involved in the link between sleep alteration, insomnia, regulation of emotion, and mood symptoms. Links between depression sleep and circadian rhythms have long been suspected due to the existence of seasonal depression, where the onset of low mood correlates with a reduction in day length. Seasonal affective disorder (SA) is primarily a circadian rhythm disorder. Alfred Lewy discusses the theory of misalignement between the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion and the midpoint of the sleep bout, and emphasise the importance or careful timing of treatment administration (bright light or melatonin). Timing of treatment administration requiring detailed information on patients’ phase state and the role of new accessible tools such as dim light melatonine onset are evaluated as are different treatment modalities. The importance of biological rhythms in SA disorder has led to an interest in the role of circadian rhythms in the development of depression. The successes of chronobiotic treatments for SA disorder have led to the trialling of psychological and pharmacological treatments targeting circadian rhythms in unipolar major depression (MDD). The review by Sarah Hartley et al. focuses on the research linking circadian rhythms and depression, and on the evidence for effectiveness of chronobiotic treatments such as high intensity light, melatonin or melatonin agonist or behavioural therapy in MDD. The evidence base for novel antidepressants combining 5HT2c antagonist and melatonin agonist action in acute treatment of unipolar MDD and in relapse prevention is reviewed as is their use in clinical management of MDD. Managing bipolar disorder is a challenge for psychiatrists and it has been long known that sleep disorders are a sign of relapse. Carole Boudebesse et al. examine the evidence that sleep and circadian rhythms are disturbed in bipolar patients during both mood episodes and periods of remission. Therapeutic applications of chronobiology in bipolar disorder, such as specific psychosocial interventions, light therapy and physical exercise are described. Finally, psychiatrists are faced with frequent reports of sleep disorders in adults and children with attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and, conversely, sleep specialists report certain symptoms of ADHD (attention deficits, fidgeting) in patients suffering from primary sleep disorders. Are ADHD symptoms secondary to sleep fragmentation due to sleep disorders such as sleep disordered breathing and periodic legs movements, and treatable with treatment of these specific disorders? Could some ADHD subjects share a common deficit in the sleep/wake regulation systems resulting in sleep fragmentation? The pathophysiological relationship between sleep disorders and ADHD is complex and probably multidirectional. The hot topic from the team of Astrid Claret et al. reviews the latest research and aims to help clinicians in developing a framework for understanding and treating patients suffering from ADHD and sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal enuresis (NE) is a very frequent problem, characterized by involuntary urination during sleep in individuals aged five years or more, after exclusion of organic causes. This set of associated symptoms may lead to deterioration of bladder function, upper urinary tract and, in extreme cases, even renal failure. The prevalence of voiding dysfunctions is as high as 10% of the world's pediatric population. This commentary discusses the etiology and pathophysiology, and current approaches to therapeutic management of NE. Different studies have shown associations with genetic predisposition, hormonal and metabolic factors, and central nervous system maturation delay. The major pathogenetic mechanisms include nocturnal polyuria, detrusor over activity, and disturbed sleep. Psychologic and behavioral abnormalities seem to be a result, rather than a cause, of NE. We highlight the need for this condition not to be understood as an isolated phenomenon but as a combination of several possible factors in a particular child. Bedwetting is only part of a complex set of changes in children’s lives, which leads to important functional impairments and psychosocial disorders, often ignored by the family and even by the health professionals. The scenario of associated disorders demonstrates the need for a comprehensive approach.",

Sleepiness has an important impact on general health and functional status, influencing how individuals perceive their energy and fatigue levels (3). Sleep deprivation and sleepiness in general have been associated with poor job performance, anxiety, difficulties in personal relations, and an increased risk for fatal and nonfatal automobile accidents, daytime sleepiness resulting from chronic partial or total sleep deprivation has been demonstrated to result in neurocognitive deficits and alterations in mood, and more recently to cause alterations in physiological and endocrine functions (4–26). Sleep deprivation has also been directly or indirectly linked to several recent catastrophes including the Exxon Valdez oil spill, space shuttle Challenger explosion, and the Three Mile Island near-meltdown.",

Under all specified conditions, intensive audiogenic clonic or clonic-tonic convulsions caused long-lasting and pronounced sleep disorders in rats associated with disorganization of the mechanisms of starting the fast-wave sleep phase in the first place. But after experimental deprivations of sleep the audiogenic paroxysmal seizures run only as initial motor excitement without obvious convulsions. Such sort of seizures promote a faster beginning of recovery process after deprivations and did not cause any disorganization of the function of the brain systems responsible for starting and shaping (maintenance) fast-wave sleep.",

However, other abnormal movements can emerge during sleep, either as a primary phenomenon or in association with another underlying movement disorder, such as Parkinson's disease. In addition, some movement disorders are associated with excessive daytime sleepiness or insomnia. A history from the patient's bed-partner is very helpful in the assessment of movement disorders during sleep. The patient themself may not be aware of the problem, and may simply report excessive daytime sleepiness because of poor quality of sleep. Movement disorders during sleep are often a very early symptom of another underlying movement disorder such as Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy, but may be overlooked unless specific enquiry is made during history taking. Table 12.1 lists causes of movement disorders which occur during sleep, and movement disorders which may be associated with sleep disturbance.",

      "abstract": "Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) refers to any situation in which an individual is unable to completely close the nasal airway during speech.The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of a complex group of structures that act in unison to control airflow through the nose and mouth by elevation of the soft palate and constriction of both the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls (►Fig. 1).Any disruption in this mechanism may result in abnormal, poorly intelligible speech.VPD can manifest as hypernasality, nasal emission, decreased vocal intensity, and/or facial grimacing. 1Moreover, patients who suffer from VPD will frequently develop maladaptive articulations to compensate for their speech difficulties. 2umerous etiologies can be responsible for this failure of normal speech production.Myoneurogenic problems can impair muscle control or affect muscle programming.Anatomic irregularities can present as a tissue deficit, structural problems that affect function, or even mechanical interference preventing normal closure.Mislearning comprises a host of etiologies whereby the patient has developed abnormal usage of the velopharyngeal mechanism despite the absence of other pathology. 3elopharyngeal dysfunction is a carefully chosen term that simply denotes the presence of incomplete velopharyngeal closure without making suggestions as to its cause.Use of this nomenclature has gained increasing favor by experts, replacing the previous designation, velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI).This helps to avoid confusion, as VPI has been differentially interpreted as denoting insufficiency, incompetence, and inadequacy-terms that may be similar, but are not synonymous and potentially implicate the cause of the dysfunction rather than describe the clinical finding.VPD is seen in roughly 20 to 30% of individuals who have undergone cleft palate repair, 4,5 and 5 to 10% of patients with a submucous cleft palate (SMCP). 6",

      "abstract": "Assistive technology involving voice communication is used primarily by people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or who have speech and/or language disabilities. It is also used to a lesser extent by people with visual or motor disabilities. A very wide range of devices has been developed for people with hearing loss. These devices can be categorized not only by the modality of stimulation [i.e., auditory, visual, tactile, or direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve (auditory-neural)] but also in terms of the degree of speech processing that is used. At least four such categories can be distinguished: assistive devices (a) that are not designed specifically for speech, (b) that take the average characteristics of speech into account, (c) that process articulatory or phonetic characteristics of speech, and (d) that embody some degree of automatic speech recognition. Assistive devices for people with speech and/or language disabilities typically involve some form of speech synthesis or symbol generation for severe forms of language disability. Speech synthesis is also used in text-to-speech systems for sightless persons. Other applications of assistive technology involving voice communication include voice control of wheelchairs and other devices for people with mobility disabilities.",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

      "title": "Parasomnias and Movement Disorders of Sleep",
      "abstract": "Neurologists are often enlisted to help diagnose, evaluate, and manage a spectrum of abnormal spells during the night ranging from parasomnias to motor disturbance that span the sleep-wake cycle. Parasomnias are undesirable emotional or physical events that accompany sleep. These events typically occur during entry into sleep from wakefulness, or during arousals from sleep, and are often augmented by the sleep state. Some parasomnias, such as the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder may be extremely undesirable, while others such as somniloquy are often of little concern. The parasomnias include a spectrum of abnormal emotions, movements, behaviors, sensory perceptions, dream mentation, and autonomic activity. Basic physiologic drives, such as sex, hunger, and aggression, may manifest as sleep-related eating, sleep-related sexual behaviors, and sleep-related violence. Parasomnias have a very bizarre nature, but are readily explainable, diagnosable, and treatable. They are hypothesized to be due to changes in brain organization across multiple states of being, and are particularly apt to occur during the incomplete transition or oscillation from one sleep state to another. Parasomnias are often explained on the basis that wakefulness and sleep are not mutually exclusive states, and abnormal intrusion of wakefulness into non-REM (NREM) sleep produces arousal disorders, and intrusion of wakefulness into REM sleep produces REM sleep parasomnias and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), two closely related conditions that often result in disturbed sleep onset and sleep maintenance, are also reviewed in this article. Although the mechanisms that underlie idiopathic RLS or PLMD are not fully understood, there is currently substantial evidence that dopaminergic dysfunction is likely involved in both conditions. The discussion will conclude with the \"other parasomnias\" and sleep-related movement disorders of clinical interest to the neurologist.",

      "abstract": "Physiological changes during pregnancy often disrupt women's sleep. If these changes are combined with other factors (obesity, iron or magnesium deficiency, anxiety, etc.), the pregnant woman may develop sleep disorders: obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, restless legs syndrome, leg cramps, and insomnia. These disorders increase the risk of pregnancy complications, reduce the quality of a woman's life, and form the basis for somatic and mental disorders in the postpartum period. Therefore, the obstetrician has to be familiar with the phenomenology, diagnosis, and treatment of sleep disorders in pregnant women to treat them promptly or to refer a woman to a neurologist or psychiatrist. This review briefly describes the common sleep disorders occurring in pregnant women, especially the various types of insomnia. The main groups of sedative agents are characterized, of which only doxylamine is acceptable for use in routine practice because of its proven efficacy and safety during pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a common clinical condition characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, accompanied by symptoms such as irritability or fatigue during wakefulness. Insomnia is often divided into subtypes based on the prevailing symptom. Insomnia is a risk factor for developing other somatic and mental disorders such as cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, depression, and causes increased healthcare costs. Given the bidirectional association of insomnia with the development of other somatic and mental diseases, the term “comorbid insomnia” may be used. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia involve genetic, environmental, behavioural, and physiological factors. The goals of insomnia treatment are to improve quantitative and qualitative aspects of sleep, to reduce the distress and anxiety associated with poor sleep, and to improve daytime function. Efficacious treatments for insomnia include behavioural, cognitive, and pharmacological interventions. Simple behavioural interventions may be provided in primary care facilities, but lack of training in these techniques limits their use. Among pharmacological interventions, the most evidence exists for benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, although on-going concerns focus on their safety as compared to modest efficacy. Different “natural” and OTC drugs are used as sleeping medications, for instance melatonin-based drugs. Behavioural treatments should be used whenever possible, and drugs should be limited to the lowest necessary dose and shortest necessary duration.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a period of relaxation and repair. During sleep, waste products of brain metabolism are removed. It plays central role in maintenance of physiological homeostasis and psychological balance. Sufficient sleep helps us think more clearly, complete complex tasks better and more consistently. One of the important function of sleep is to promote synaptic plasticity and neuronal recovery for proper brain functioning. Memory consolidation, brain growth and repair are other functions proposed for sleep. Problems related to sleep deprivation are being increased in today's modern society. Every day there seems to be twice as much work and half as much time to complete it, this results in a decrease in sleep or extended periods of wakefulness. Sleep deprived individuals may not have difficulty of verbal disturbances but research studies have shown that individuals have more difficulty in reacting well, to taking biological discussion and implementing the task with efficiency of action. Although day time performance due to sleep loss is experienced universally but in professionals such as paramilitary forces, army personals, who work under stressful conditions are more vulnerable to the sleep deprivation. These conditions become more stressful during emergencies and war because, after periods of extended wakefulness neurons may begin to malfunction, visibly affecting person's behavior. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep plays a role in learning due to an activation of the hippocampus involved in encoding new memories. Many experiments have shown that the day after a good night's sleep, one may retain newly acquired knowledge or a newly learned skill more effectively. An enriched environment (EE) which is a complex combination of social, cognitive, and physical stimulation, improves learning and memory. Many changes such as increased brain weight, synaptic plasticity, gliogenesis, growth of dendritic spine as well as change in neurotransmitter content, up regulation of neuronal signaling molecules, neurotrophin levels and adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been reported.",

      "abstract": "This article outlines several aspects of sleep regulation relevant to pediatric pain management. A broad range of connections between sleep and pain are described: (1) pain can interfere with the quality and quantity of children's sleep; (2) insufficient sleep (quality or quantity) can cause daytime sequelae (behavioral and emotional changes) that interfere with the coping skills necessary for effective pain management; (3) fear and anxiety often have a negative impact on both pain and sleep; (4) feelings of safety and control frequently have a positive effect on both sleep and pain symptoms; (5) adequate sleep seems to promote both physiological (tissue repair) and psychological (transient cessation of the perception of pain signals) processes relevant to recovery from pain, injury, and illness; and (6) treatment approaches to pediatric sleep and pain problems show considerable overlap with respect to many pharmacological as well as cognitive-behavioral interventions. Given these multiple links, a better understanding of sleep--and its importance in physical and mental health--is likely to be of value to clinicians and researchers working in areas of pediatric pain management. One specific hypothesis to be addressed is the possible contribution of sleep disruption as a step in the progression to some chronic pain syndromes.",

      "title": "[Pathophysiology of auditory and speech perception].",
      "abstract": "Auditory perception or hearing can be defined as the interpretation of sensory evidence, produced by the ears in response to sound, in terms of the events that caused the sound. We do not hear a window but we may hear a window closing. We do not hear a dog but we may hear a dog barking. And we do not hear a person but we may hear a person talking. Hearing impairment can result in anxiety or stress in everyday life. Pure-tone hearing loss (or threshold shift) is a measure of hearing impairment. Aging and excessive noise are the main causes of hearing impairment. Speech perception is another concept. The difference with the former is best illustrated by the disabled individual declaring \"I can hear that someone is talking to me, but I don't understand what she says\". Being unable to understand easily and clearly significant others, especially in understanding speech in a noisy environment, can give rise to considerable psychosocial and professional consequences (disability). Presbycusis is the decline in hearing sensitivity caused by the aging process at different levels of the auditory system. However, it is difficult to isolate age effects from other contributors to age-related hearing loss such as noise damage, genetic susceptibility, inflammatory otologic disorders, and ototoxic agents. Therefore, presbycusis and age-related hearing loss are often used synonymously. In this report pathophysiology is mostly described with regard to presbycusis, and the main peripheral types of presbycusis (sensory or Corti organ-related, strial, and neural) are summarized. An original experimental model of strial presbycusis, based on chronic application of furosemide at the round window, is further described. Central presbycusis is mainly determined by degeneration secondary to peripheral impairment (concept of deafferentation). Central auditory changes typically affect speed of processing and result in poorer speech understanding in noise or with rapid or degraded speech. Last, age-related cognitive factors can be associated to peripheral hearing impairment and increase disability in speech understanding in noise.",

      "title": "Vertigo",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: “Dizziness” is a common complaint that implies a sense of disorientation, usually an altered perception of position in the environment. It may be due to lightheadedness or faintness (eg, the adolescent who has orthostatic hypotension), occur in association with a variety of acute medical disorders (eg, the febrile child who has vomiting and dehydration), or have a psychosomatic origin (eg, depression, anxiety, or exhaustion).Dizziness is formally classified into four categories: vertigo, presyncope, dysequilibrium, and light-headedness. Vertigo is defined as an illusion of movement, most often a sensation of rotation or, less frequently, linear displacement or tilt. Vertigo is the key symptom of vestibular pathology and usually the result of abnormalities of the labyrinth, although it also may be symptomatic of other neurologic disease (eg, seizures or migraines). It typically is accompanied by symptoms of varying degree, including nausea, vomiting, pallor, and perspiration. There is no loss of consciousness.The prevalence of vertigo in children is unknown. A recently published study of Scottish school children reported that 15% had experienced at least one episode of dizziness in a 1-year period. Almost 50% were assessed as having “paroxysmal vertigo” with accompanying symptoms frequently suggestive of migraine (pallor, nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia).The etiology of vertigo may be due to abnormalities of the vestibular, visual, or proprioceptive systems. The labyrinth (the paired organs of equilibrium) consists of three semicircular canals stimulated by angular acceleration and the utricle and saccule stimulated by gravitational forces and vertical acceleration. Impulses pass via the vestibular nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and then ascend in the medial longitudinal fasiculus (to the cranial nerves for eye movement) and descend in the vestibulospinal tracts (excitatory stimuli to the extensor muscles of the head, extremities, and trunk for maintenance of upright posture). The cerebellum receives afferent impulses and functions as a center for integrating oculovestibular and postural responses. Cortical vestibular representation is at the level of the posterior temporal gyrus.Vestibular function is assessed by evaluating the oculovestibular reflex and intensity of nystagmus produced by rotatory and caloric stimulation of the labyrinth. The oculovestibular reflex permits ocular fixation on stationary objects while the head and body are in motion.Nystagmus is the observed movement of the eye in response to stimulation of the labyrinth, retrocochlear vestibular, or central vestibulo-ocular pathway. It is classified as spontaneous or induced by direction and by fatigability. The direction of nystagmus is designated by the fast component (ocular realignment). The slow component represents the oculovestibular response.Vertigo may be due to peripheral vestibular disease or central vestibular dysfunction. When not associated with actual movement, the cause of vertigo is found in the peripheral system in 85% of cases. Use of the term “peripheral” implies that the problem occurs either in the end organ (semicircular canals or utricle) or in the peripheral nerve.The clinical presentations differ and allow for localization of the vertiginous symptomatology (Table 1).The medical history is the initial and most important step in evaluation of the child who complains of dizziness or vertigo. Young children may not have the capacity or vocabulary to describe the sensation of vertigo, but they can use “playground synonyms” such as spinning, swinging, sliding, or like “a merry-go-round.” The key symptom is a sensation of motion that is either rotatory or linear.The associated aural and neurologic symptoms must be sought carefully. Are there other symptoms of hearing loss (that may fluctuate), fullness, pressure, or ringing? Is there objective evidence of a hearing disorder? If tinnitus or ringing is present, is it continuous, intermittent, or pausitile? Are there symptoms of cortical or brainstem disorders such as headache, visual changes, seizures, or loss of consciousness?The complete physical examination should focus on neurologic evaluation of the cranial nerves and cerebellar function (past-pointing and tandem gait). The auditory canal and tympanic membranes must be examined to evaluate for evidence of middle ear infection, malformations, cholesteatoma, or a perilymphatic fistula. A fistula test can be performed in a cooperative child with a pneumatic otoscope or tragal pressure. The child is instructed to look straight ahead, and the eyes are examined while continuous positive and then negative pressure is applied. Normally, there should be no drift of the eyes. In the presence of perilymphatic fistula, the eyes may drift slowly away from the ear with positive pressure and back toward the ear with negative pressure.An important sign is the presence of spontaneous or induced nystagmus. Endpoint or physiologic nystagmus is seen in normal children at a 40-degree deviation of the eyes. Because visual fixation may inhibit mild vestibular nystagmus, otolaryngologists use Frenzel glasses (+10 diopters) both to magnify the eyes and to prevent fixation suppression.Clinical testing in the office or emergency department may provide much information about the child or adolescent who has vertigo. Simple tests of balance include the Romberg and Unterberger-Fukuda test (stepping or marching test). The Romberg test evaluates proprioceptive function. A variation of the original examination—the tandem Romberg test—can be performed by having the child place one foot directly in front of the other with the arms either at the sides or crossed in front. Vision is allowed and then excluded. The Unterberger-Fukuda test is performed with the arms placed straight out in front at shoulder height. Vision is excluded, and the child is instructed to maintain the original position and march in place. A total of 50 marching steps should be taken. Normally, patients either will remain in place, step forward up to 50 cms, or turn within approximately 30 degrees of center. Patients who have chronic peripheral vestibular lesions will march slowly toward the side of the lesion.The Hallpike-Dix maneuver should be used during the neurologic examination to elicit paroxysmal positional nystagmus. The child is placed in a sitting position midway on a flat examining table and instructed to look straight ahead at all times. The examiner first turns the head to the side, and the patient then quickly is placed backwards with the head over the end of the table. The response in patients who have a positional vertigo is horizontal rotary nystagmus with the fast phase to the downward ear. The onset of the nystagmus is delayed with typically a 1- to 2-second latency that lasts for 10 to 20 seconds and is associated with a sensation of rotational vertigo. With this positioning maneuver, nystagmus and vertigo occur with the affected ear down. If a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is considered clinically, the Hallpike-Dix maneuver is not recommended because it may interfere with immediate bedside treatment of this disorder.All patients who have symptoms of vertigo must undergo hearing testing or, in infants, auditory brainstem evoked response testing. Additional pediatric investigations depend on the characteristics of the vertigo and accompanying symptoms in the individual patient. Children who have persistent nonspecific vertigo require a complete blood count, glucose tolerance test, and measurement of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and thyroid function. Certain patients may require testing for sickle cell disease. Patients who have sensorineural hearing loss or neurologic findings should receive computed tomography with thin cuts through the temporal bones, magnetic resonance imaging (± gadolinium), or angiography. If there is a history of associated loss of consciousness, an electroencephalographic study should be obtained.Based on the course of the symptoms, the physical examination, and the results of the previously noted investigations, the child may require referral to an otolaryngologist for additional vestibular testing. Caloric testing is the definitive procedure for identification of vestibular pathology. Electronystagmography is a collection of examinations for the saccadic, optokinetic, and smooth pursuit systems and of nystagmus induced by warming and cooling the labyrinth. These tests are nonspecific and do not provide a diagnosis, but when results are abnormal, they are suggestive of vestibular dysfunction.Other testing used by otolaryngologists in specific circumstances includes rotating chair tests, vestibular autorotation test (physiologic stimuli of high frequency produced by active head oscillations), and posturography (sway movement testing).Acute-onset vertigo or paroxysmal episodes of vertigo can be approached clinically based on the presence or absence of hearing loss (Table 2). If vertigo is continuous and unremitting, assessment can be based on the presence or absence of neurologic abnormalities (Table 3). The diagnosis of labyrinthitis is based on a history of infection preceding the onset of vertigo and the presence of hearing impairment. The child usually is most comfortable lying on the unaffected side. Any movement causes severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. These episodic symptoms usually subside after several days. This condition is much more frequent in children than had been recognized in the past and often is caused by minor head trauma. There is a sudden onset of hearing loss and vertigo from rupture of the round or oval window into the vestibule that results in the creation of a fistula. An abrupt change in barometric pressure (eg, decompression syndrome) also can result in a similar rupture.Menière syndrome is very uncommon in children. Symptoms consist of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, a sensation of pressure in the ear, and tinnitus. Recurrent episodes of vertigo and tinnitus are common, with progressive hearing loss after each event.This disorder primarily occurs in adolescents following respiratory infection. Symptoms include vertigo, nausea, and vomiting with postural instability. Episodes are self-limited but tend to recur with decreasing intensity. Diagnosis is made by electronystagmography and thermal caloric testing. Benign paroxysmal vertigo presents initially between 1 and 2 years of age, with symptoms recurring to the age of 4 years. The child presents suddenly with extreme unsteadiness and may be unable to remain upright. Nystagmus may be present, but other symptoms such as vomiting are uncommon. The child is fully conscious throughout the entire episode. Many children develop migraine later in life. The diagnosis is supported by a family history of migraine. Another migraine variant seen in infants is paroxysmal torticollis. A child who has this rare form of migraine will tilt his or her head to one side for several hours (and infrequently for up to several days). There may be associated vomiting. These episodes usually cease by 2 years of age, with many children developing typical migraine headaches by early childhood.Head trauma with or without temporal bone fracture can produce labyrinthine concussion. There is severe vertigo, with unsteadiness and falling toward the affected side. These symptoms may persist, but they gradually diminish in intensity over a 4- to 6-week period.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has been described in children as young as 11 years of age. The cause has been determined to be the presence of free-floating debris in the posterior semicircular canal. This type of vertigo has been related to head trauma or vestibular neuronitis. In a proportion of patients, no cause can be found. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is provoked by a change in position and lasts for seconds. Basilar artery migraine presents primarily in adolescent girls with recurrent stereotypic attacks of brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction. The clinical features can include ataxia, dysarthria, vertigo, and tinnitus. There are variable bilateral visual complaints. Alternating hemiplegia and paresthesias of the face and limbs can occur, and there can be alteration of consciousness. A severe pounding or pulsatile headache will follow. Vertigo also may be the aura preceding a generalized seizure or present as an actual ictal phenomenon (partial complex seizure). Vestibulogenic seizures are very rare and represent a form of reflex sensory epilepsy (induced by spinning).The treatment of vertigo depends on the duration and discomfort of the symptom and the underlying pathology. Acute vertigo can be treated symptomatically and with reassurance. Antiemetics can be given rectally or intramuscularly. Vestibular sedation or suppressant medication is also useful (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, and diazepam). Persistent severe nausea and vomiting may require administration of prochlorperazine or metoclopramide.Most children who have acute vertigo recover spontaneously over a period of several weeks to months. Symptomatic recovery is due to vestibular compensation and central plasticity (reorganization of vestibular circuits). In some children and adolescents, symptoms recur, often in association with physical or psychological stress. Medications producing vestibular sedation should not be prescribed for long-term daily use because they may interfere with the normal compensation process.A specific treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a bedside maneuver (Epley particle repositioning maneuver). This maneuver relocates the free floating debris from the posterior semicircular canal into the vestibule of the labyrinth. Symptomatic relief after a single treatment session is reported in 80% to 90% of patients, although 15% to 30% may have recurrence of symptoms. The maneuver is repeated until nystagmus no longer can be elicited (Figure). A modified version of the Epley maneuver can be taught to patients with instructions to perform the activity three times a day until there are no symptoms of positional vertigo for 24 hours.Chronic or recurrent vertigo is often resistant to treatment, but it may respond to a course of clonazepam or carbamazepine. Exercise regimens also have been prescribed, with balance and gait training during dynamic tasks that precipitate the patient’s symptoms. These exercises are practiced until an asymptomatic state is reached. Management of accompanying psychological symptoms (eg, anxiety, panic attacks, depression) depends on the nature of the associated symptom.Surgical procedures for the treatment of vertigo rarely are required in childhood. Endolymphatic arachnoid shunt operations are successful in 65% of patients who have Menière disease. Disabling vertigo due to vestibular nerve or labyrinthine disorders may require vestibular nerve section. Surgery is an option for patients who have severe intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using procedures to disable the posterior semicircular canal.Appropriate management of vertigo depends on determination of the etiology and carefully tailored treatment plans specific to the vestibular or central disorder producing the vertigo.",

Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass 81%–90% der Patienten mit einer RBD innerhalb von zehn Jahren eine Alpha-Synukleopathie (Morbus Parkinson, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz, Multisystematrophie) entwickeln. Durch das Fehlen der normalerweise auftretenden Suppression der motorischen Aktivität während des REM-Schlafes, kommt es zum Ausagieren von Träumen. Die Diagnosesicherung erfolgt mittels Polysomnografie. Meist tritt die RBD zwischen dem 50. und 60. Lebensjahr erstmals auf. Männer sind wahrscheinlich häufiger betroffen als Frauen. Bei Patienten mit RBD fallen oft schon früh subtile Veränderungen wie Hyposmie, Obstipation oder Veränderungen der Motorik oder Kognition auf, die weitere Zeichen einer beginnenden neurodegenerativen Erkrankung sein können. Das gleichzeitige Auftreten der RBD bei bekannter, neurodegenerativer Erkrankung, ist häufig mit einem schwereren Verlauf verbunden. Neben Bettsicherungsmaßnahmen kommen zur medikamentösen Behandlung am häufigsten Clonazepam oder hochdosiertes Melatonin zum Einsatz. Die RBD stellt als Prodomalstadium einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung einen zentralen Ansatzpunkt für die Entwicklung und Untersuchung einer neuroprotektiven, krankheitsmodulierenden Therapie dar.",

Despite the large amount now known about sleep problems, health professionals are still insufficiently trained in preventing, assessing and treating sleep disorders. Changes at puberty halt the previous steady reduction of sleep during childhood. Adolescence may bring particular sleep problems such as delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), which is common in teenagers. Late-night social or other activities make it physiologically impossible to get to sleep, leading to insufficient sleep and sleep debt which, if unrecognised or incorrectly diagnosed and left untreated, may cause daytime sleepiness and underfunctioning. General practitioners, health visitors and school nurses can help by being better informed about sleep disorders, their identification and treatment, and being ready to refer complex problems to specialist centres.",

      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

The word cerebral means having to do with the brain. The word palsy means a weakness or problem in the way a person moves or positions his or her body. A kid with Cerebral palsy (CP) has trouble controlling the muscles of the body (hall mark of the condition is motor dysfunction, i.e. there is abnormal muscle tone, abnormal posture and movement) [1,2]. Normally, the brain tells the rest of the body exactly what to do and when to do it. But because CP affects the brain, depending on what part of the brain is affected, a kid might not be able to walk, talk, eat or play the way most kids do. It is a non-progressive but often changing motor impairment syndromes. It is usually secondary to an insult of limited duration or anomalies of the brain arising in the early stages of development.

      "title": "Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The term \"brain death\" (BD) is used to indicate a clinical situation characterized by the irreversible loss of all brain functions; the identification of this condition is closely linked to the development of intensive care medicine that, with mechanical ventilation, allows the maintenance of somatic functions even when cerebral functions are ceased. BD diagnosis is essentially based on the presence of three cardinal clinic criteria: 1) coma or unresponsiveness, 2) absence of brainstem reflexes 3) absence of spontaneous breathing, evaluated with apnea test. For BD diagnosis the following prerequisites must be scrupolously considered: knowledge of the proximate cause of coma and confirmation of its irreversibility; exclusion of confounding clinical variables (severe electrolyte, acid-base, endocrine disturbances); hypothermia and/or hypotension; drug intoxication or poisoning. Ancillary tests used in BD confirmation are represented by neurophysiological methods to highlight the loss of bioelectrical brain activity (EEG, evoked potential (EP)) and methods for demonstration of cerebral circulatory arrest (TransCranial Doppler (TCD); Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT); conventional Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA); CT angiography; MRI angiography). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ancillary tests are able to confirm the complete cessation of all brain functions and then, in adults, ancillary tests are not needed for the clinical diagnosis of brain death and they should never replace the clinical neurological examination. However, even though ancillary tests are not mandatory but only optional in many countries, they continue to be used, especially when there are factors that may interfere with the complete clinical assessment or when apnea test cannot be performed. Although BD is a relatively simple clinical diagnosis, there are substantial differences in perceptions and practices regarding its declaration among countries, states and even between hospitals worldwide. There are also cultural and religious obstacles—especially in lower-income countries—to the determination of death with neurologic criteria, which lead to the suspension of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, health organizations should implement educational campaigns to improve knowledge and awareness of current criteria among the population, and national and international scientific societies should also make every efforts to validate and standardize clinical and laboratory criteria. Finally, it should reminded and underlined that the ultimate purpose of brain death determination should be to increase the number of organs donated, to improve the quality of life of organ recipients.",

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

      "title": "Sleep Terrors: An Updated Review",
      "abstract": "Sleep terrors are common, frightening, but fortunately benign events. Familiarity with this condition is important so that an accurate diagnosis can be made.To familiarize physicians with the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of children with sleep terrors.A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key terms \"sleep terrors\" OR \"night terrors\". The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. Only papers published in the English literature were included in this review. The information retrieved from the above search was used in the compilation of the present article.It is estimated that sleep terrors occur in 1 to 6.5% of children 1 to 12 years of age. Sleep terrors typically occur in children between 4 and 12 years of age, with a peak between 5 and 7 years of age. The exact etiology is not known. Developmental, environmental, organic, psychological, and genetic factors have been identified as a potential cause of sleep terrors. Sleep terrors tend to occur within the first three hours of the major sleep episode, during arousal from stage three or four non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In a typical attack, the child awakens abruptly from sleep, sits upright in bed or jumps out of bed, screams in terror and intense fear, is panicky, and has a frightened expression. The child is confused and incoherent: verbalization is generally present but disorganized. Autonomic hyperactivity is manifested by tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, flushed face, dilated pupils, agitation, tremulousness, and increased muscle tone. The child is difficult to arouse and console and may express feelings of anxiety or doom. In the majority of cases, the patient does not awaken fully and settles back to quiet and deep sleep. There is retrograde amnesia for the attack the following morning. Attempts to interrupt a sleep terror episode should be avoided. As sleep deprivation can predispose to sleep terrors, it is important that the child has good sleep hygiene and an appropriate sleeping environment. Medical intervention is usually not necessary, but clonazepam may be considered on a short-term basis at bedtime if sleep terrors are frequent and severe or are associated with functional impairment, such as fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and distress. Anticipatory awakening, performed approximately half an hour before the child is most likely to experience a sleep terror episode, is often effective for the treatment of frequently occurring sleep terrors.Most children outgrow the disorder by late adolescence. In the majority of cases, there is no specific treatment other than reassurance and parental education. Underlying conditions, however, should be treated if possible and precipitating factors should be avoided.",

Some mutations provoke a beginning in the adolescence and a quickly development. At present it doesn’t exist a treatment, none to the disease, but also to the different neurologic associated disorders (myoclonus, seizures, dementia) and fatal outcome. Along the evolution, it´s usual to find psychotic symptoms, especially auditory hallucinations. We present a case with atypical evolution: The subject presents auditory hallucinations, with a good response to psychopharmacological treatment. The presence of these symptoms could be observed in the first years of the diseases. We describe the status of the patient at the admission, the evolution during the stay, with the increase of symptoms in several areas (cognitive, motor, neurologic), and the current status, after hospitalization, where the patient begun receiving enteral nutrition by gastrostomie, due to the limitations to receive the treatment and /or nutrition by oral way. This case is also interesting due to the use of Metformine, an antidiabetic agent, whose use has been suggested as therapeutic alternative for this syndrome.",

This review describes the main observed effects of the three principal shifts (night, morning and afternoon) on patterns of sleep and wakefulness. The mechanism of sleep disruption in relation to circadian rhythms and the specific impact of aspects of shift organization (speed and direction of rotation) are discussed. The most troublesome acute symptoms are difficulty getting to sleep, shortened sleep and somnolence during working hours that continues into successive days off. These are only partially amenable to amelioration by manipulating shift patterns. However, there is no clear indication that chronic sleep problems result from long‐term shift work.",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "Specific Phobia vs Panic Disorder in Children: A Unique Case Report and Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Specific phobia is defined as marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear and anxiety, is actively avoided, or endured with intense fear or anxiety that is out proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object/situation and to the sociocultural context. These symptoms are persistent and last for at least six months. The prevalence of specific and social phobia in children and adolescents is 2.9 and 0.3%. Panic disorder is defined as recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and is accompanied by at least 4/13 symptoms. One of these panic attacks must be followed by at least one month of constant worry about additional panic attacks and their consequences. There is a significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks. Such disturbances are not attributable to physiological effects of other substances, medical conditions, or other mental disorders. The prevalence of panic disorders is 5 – 15 percent in adolescents and 5 percent in children.\r\n\r\nCase Presentation: We present a case of a 3-year old male with panic attacks for over one year which started after an incident of smoke detector alarm followed by three more episodes of panic attacks at the daycare center. The recent episode was 4 weeks ago. After the last incident, the patient stopped eating and refused food which worsened over the past 2 weeks. The patient was evaluated and diagnosed with panic disorder, specific phobia, eating disorder, and referred to outpatient Psychologist.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n• Learn about anxiety disorders in children.\r\n\r\n• Management options for anxiety in children.\r\n\r\n• Etiopathogenesis of anxiety in children.\r\n\r\nConclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of panic disorder below the age of 4. We conducted a literature review and found no cases published. This is an interesting case for psychiatrists, therapists and pediatricians to learn as there is a lack of evidence in treating children under the age of 4. No medication recommendations were available for this age group; however, off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication was discussed with the patient’s mother who refused. We agreed with the primary care team’s recommendations and the case was referred to an out-patient psychotherapist.",

The incidence of this disorder is increasing and it is no longer uncommon to encounter a child or adult with some form of autism spectrum disorder in their own environment.\r\n Despite this, autism is still a significant unknown to most people and a great challenge to anyone working with children or adults with this disorder. Their specifics in communication and interaction often make it difficult to interact with them, learn, work, and other activities.\r\n Autism spectrum disorder involves different forms of autism as well as differences in providing the level of support they need to function. Despite the large differences within the spectrum, there are some characteristics that connect them. Difficulties in communication (verbal and nonverbal), socialization (reduced desire to contact people, inappropriate relationships with others, lack of understanding of the way people cooperate with each other, communicate), and the existence of some repetitive actions or narrowed and specific interests or fixations are specific symptoms present. These symptoms are more or less present in all children and adults with autism spectrum disorder. These characteristics significantly affect the daily functioning of people and it is important to be aware of them in contact with each other, and the environment must know them and adapt to help them.\r\n In her daily work, the nurse often encounters children and adults with various difficulties or mental illnesses. In addition to education, acquired knowledge and skills related to certain conditions and diseases can facilitate the process of examination, hospitalization or rehabilitation of a child who is afraid, does not tolerate changes, is afraid of examination and the like. Knowledge, experience and acquired skills on how to approach a child to a nurse provide security and training, and can provide better support to parents and the child during their stay in the health facility.",

      "abstract": "The human voice undergoes changes over the life span associated with normal development and aging and/or pathological changes in subsystems responsible for voice and speech production (respiration, phonation and articulation). Each change does not immediately indicate presence of the voice disorder. Vocal aging generally begins after the age of approximately 65 years as part of a normal physiological aging. Voice disorders in elderly can be result of the aging process itself or may be caused by some kind of illness or pathological process. Presbyphonia is a term used to describe changes in vocal quality associated with aging process, and presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related changes of the larynx results in presbyphonia. These diagnoses can be made only after careful multidisciplinary examination and exclusion of other pathological changes and possible causes of voice disorder. Some of the symptoms of presbyphonia are changes in vocal pitch, reduced loudness, increased breathiness and hoarsness, weakness of the voice, vocal tremor, inability to sustain phonation and reduced vocal quality. The impact of voice disorders in elderly has been shown to cut across a number of quality-of-life domains such as social interaction, general and emotional health, and psychological well-being. The number of people above the age of 65 is increasing rapidly worldwide and the issue of recognizing and treating voice disorders in this population is becoming increasingly important. Therapy of presbyphonia must be multidisciplinary. Vocal therapy is considered as first method of choice and its efficiency is proven by current researches. Surgical approaches are used if vocal therapy is not showing expected results.\r\nGoal of this review is to present basic information about aging and normal biological changes in the human body caused by the aging process and to show how this changes affect voice quality in the elderly. Furthermore, prevalence and incidence, definition and causes of voice disorders in elderly are shown by presenting results of the recent researches. This paper also describes diagnostic procedures and current treatments for voice disorders in elderly and addresses its efficiency.",

It is an orchestrated neurochemical process involving sleep promoting and arousal centres in the brain. Sleep propensity depends on two main factors: the amount of accumulated sleep deprivation and the circadian clock phase enhancing sleep at night.​night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEds Martin P Szuba, Jacqueline D Kloss, David F Dinges\r\n\r\nCambridge University Press, £34.95, pp 306 ISBN 0 521 01076 4\r\n\r\nRating: ★★★★\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInsomnia is a symptom, resulting from insufficient sleep or sleep of poor quality, with negative effects on subsequent daytime functioning. The prevalence of insomnia increases steeply during the fifth decade of life. People with insomnia often complain of impairments in attention, memory, or concentration, impairments in their mood, feeling depressed or irritable or anxious, and impairments in their ability to function at work, at home, or even at school. They generally have more medical complaints, seek medical care more often, and are more prone to road injuries than people without insomnia.\r\n\r\nAn enormous gap exists between the prevalence of insomnia and the actual management of people with the condition. While roughly 20% to 30% of adults worldwide get insomnia, less than 50% of them will be diagnosed as having the condition. Patients are hesitant to discuss insomnia with their doctors because they are afraid that their problem will be seen as trivial or indicate a serious illness. Doctors tend to trivialise insomnia because little of their medical training is devoted to it and because they are often unaware that the onset of insomnia may signal a serious condition or an established risk factor for psychiatric illness.\r\n\r\nInsomnia: Principles and Management announces the arrival of this complex sleep disorder at the frontiers of internal and sleep medicine. With contributions from highly prominent sleep specialists, this multi-authored volume captures the breadth of the field and introduces a diverse array of up-to-date scientific and clinical data ranging from the diagnosis, prevalence, aetiology, and management of insomnia to the neurobiology of sleep and arousal. It also provides several perspectives on related disorders, such as circadian rhythm sleep disorders in sighted and blind subjects, jet lag, and mood disorders.\r\n\r\nThe book reviews the various approaches for the management of insomnia, including behavioural approaches, the use of hypnotic drugs aimed at treating sleep quantity deficits, and the use of chronobiotic drugs (biological clock effectors, such as melatonin and its analogues) to improve the circadian control of the sleep-wake cycle. If indeed melatonin plays a role in sleep regulation, either through its chronobiotic, soporific activities or both, we would expect that exogenous melatonin administration will be able to induce sleep during daytime or when the homeostatic drive to sleep is insufficient, and to improve sleep in cases where there is a deficiency in endogenous melatonin. This is indeed demonstrated in blind subjects, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and elderly patients with insomnia in whom melatonin production is diminished.\r\n\r\nAnother important contribution of this book is the effort to identify where research should be heading. In recent years, the focus of clinically oriented sleep medicine has shifted from sleep quantity to sleep quality, as quality rather than quantity is associated with impaired daytime functioning, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and poor quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis succinct and informative volume will be useful to both sleep experts and general practitioners alike.",

Women are more often afflicted than men, and insomnia disorder is a risk factor for somatic and mental illness, especially depression and anxiety disorders. Persistent hyperarousals at the cognitive, emotional, cortical and/or physiological levels are central to most theories regarding the pathophysiology of insomnia. Of the defining features of insomnia disorder, the discrepancy between minor objective polysomnographic alterations of sleep continuity and substantive subjective impairment in insomnia disorder remains enigmatic. Microstructural alterations, especially in rapid eye movement sleep (“rapid eye movement sleep instability”), might explain this mismatch between subjective and objective findings. As rapid eye movement sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep, it might be particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. In consequence, mentation during rapid eye movement sleep may be toned more as conscious‐like wake experience, reflecting pre‐sleep concerns. It is suggested that this instability of rapid eye movement sleep is involved in the mismatch between subjective and objective measures of sleep in insomnia disorder. Furthermore, as rapid eye movement sleep has been linked in previous works to emotional processing, rapid eye movement sleep instability could play a central role in the close association between insomnia and depressive and anxiety disorders.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

In 25 healthy subjects, variable amounts of sleep loss (1-3 h for 1-3 nights) caused headaches lasting from 1 h to all day. The headache was most frequently a dull ache, a heaviness or a pressure sensation felt in the forehead and/or at the vertex. Simple analgesics, purchaseable without a doctor's prescription, completely or markedly reduced the head pain in 20-60 min. Headaches due to insufficient sleep differ from tension headaches in their site, duration and response to analgesics.

      "abstract": "Summary Children with intellectual disabilities are more likely to experience sleep disorders of insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep breathing disorders than typically developing children. The present study examined risk factors for these sleep disorders in 447 children (aged 5–18 years), diagnosed with an intellectual disability and comorbid autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome or Rett syndrome. Primary caregivers reported on their child’s sleep using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC), as well as medical comorbidities and functional abilities. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were used to examine the effects of these factors on SDSC t scores and a binary indicator, respectively for the relevant subscales. Receiving operating characteristic curves were generated for each logistic regression model to determine their ability to discriminate between poor and good sleep. Comorbidities rather than functional abilities were associated with poorer sleep. In particular, recurrent pain, frequent seizures, frequent coughing, constipation and prescription of sleep medications were associated with abnormal sleep across the entire sample, but predictors differed between diagnostic groups. The present study suggests that comorbidities are more strongly associated with quality of sleep than functional impairments. The present study provides new information on potential associations between frequent coughing, prescription sleep medications and sleep quality that should be further investigated.",

Si estas asociaciones se demuestran, o se llegan a entender mejor, se podría concluir entonces que estudiar medicina (en particular) o una carrera universitaria con demandas académicas y emocionales similares (en general), tendría un nexo causal con los problemas de salud vinculados con la ansiedad, las alteraciones del sueño y los altos índices de estrés. Estos problemas incluyen, por ejemplo, las enfermedades mentales, como la depresión, o las alteraciones cardiovasculares, como la hipertensión arterial.

They can also occur secondary to the stroke itself. In this review, we describe the variety of different sleep disorders associated with stroke and analyze their effect on stroke risk and outcome. Methods: A search term-based literature review (“sleep,” “insomnia,” “narcolepsy,” “restless legs syndrome,” “periodic limb movements during sleep,” “excessive daytime sleepiness” AND “stroke” OR “cerebrovascular” in PubMed; “stroke” and “sleep” in ClinicalTrials.gov) was performed. English articles from 1990 to March 2023 were considered. Results: Increasing evidence suggests that sleep disorders are risk factors for stroke. In addition, sleep disturbance has been reported in half of all stroke sufferers; specifically, an increase is not only sleep-related breathing disorders but also periodic limb movements during sleep, narcolepsy, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, insomnia, sleep duration, and circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders. Poststroke sleep disturbance has been associated with worse outcome. Conclusion: Sleep disorders are risk factors for stroke and associated with worse stroke outcome. They are also a common consequence of stroke. Recent guidelines suggest screening for sleep disorders after stroke. It is possible that treatment of sleep disorders could both reduce stroke risk and improve stroke outcome, although further data from clinical trials are required.",

Because the definition of \"normal\" sleep is not well established, the estimates of the prevalence and severity of insomnia vary widely. Insomnia is often secondary to underlying psychiatric and medical conditions, and these should be evaluated and treated as a first measure. Nonpharmacological interventions for insomnia including sleep hygiene manoeuvres and exercise are recommended, although the success of these interventions has not been well documented. Benzodiazepines have been the pharmacologic agents of choice for the treatment of insomnia, but there is reason to exercise caution with their use; their overall benefit compared with placebo appears to be minor, and they are often associated with adverse cognitive effects. Unfortunately, no other class of drugs has proven to be superior to the benzodiazepines in terms of benefit:risk ratio. Given the importance of sleep for health and normal daily functioning the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of insomnia should be a research priority.",

This may cause errors in the differential diagnosis if clinicians do not add objective measures of cognitive deficits associated with each disorder. AD/HD presents neuropsychological deficits (compared to non-clinical populations) that are also present in other disorders, like deficient working memory, whereas other neuropsychological deficits are unique characteristics of AD/HD, such as sustained attention, response inhibition, and variability of response time. Likewise, anxiety disorders present neuropsychological deficits in autobiographical memory, mood disorders present neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and verbal memory.

      "title": "Burnout syndrome",
      "abstract": "Online dictionaries provide a suggestive translation for the burnout concept: \"The tubes burned out easily and had to be constantly replaced...\".This is the sequence of events that leads to the syndrome: the depletion of one's own intellectual energy, usually directly tied to the profession one has, presumably exerted with great passion and dedication, after a long lasting effort.The most accurate definition, including the eventual prophylactic actions to be taken, is based on the context in which this syndrome manifests: the surpassing of one's resistance to professional effort and of one's capability to recuperate (1,17).Its manifestation, perceived by others and by the affected individual consists of behaviors and feelings, more or less subjective, noticed by the individual and/or those around him/her.The most common symptoms overlap those found in various types of depression: fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood, lack of pleasure and motivation for daily activities concerning -surprisinglythose linked to professional activity.Other symptoms are included in the psychosomatic category: headaches, lumbago, gastrointestinal problems, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, various cenesthetic complaints.If we use the word symptoms we must include our description in the biological model, which is not necessary the case here.Official psychiatric classifications do not recognize burnout as a form of depression.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10, 1992) (2) includes this syndrome in the last chapter (amongst \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" codes Z00-Z99, in \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" code Z73.0 together with other \"problems\", such as \"Accentuation of personality traits\" including type A behavior pattern, \"Lack of relaxation and leisure\", \" Stress, not elsewhere classified\", \"Inadequate social skills, not elsewhere classified\", \"Social role conflict, not elsewhere classified\", ranging from Z73.1 to Z73.5), all of which do not refer to nosological entities, but to particularities varying with context and eventually with the individual's psycho-social vulnerability.We can thus define burnout as a cumulation of psychological symptoms, more or less interchangeable with the psychiatric equivalents, already indexed among the diagnostic criteria of some psychiatric disorders (exhaustion depression, stress disorders etc.) (3).It is true that, given time, these psychological symptoms and disfunctions can translate to actual depressive symptoms.Because burnout is, in fact, a surpassed work-related state, it is wise to be aware that the onset of the symptoms might show a change in the individual's professional life.This means that the professional act, which one performs with a",

      "title": "‘When Did My Tremor Start’: Can Essential Tremor Patients Pinpoint Their Disease Onset",
      "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological disorders among adults, and it is the most common tremor disorder.[1-8] As in other neurodegenerative diseases, age of onset in ET is chiefly assessed by the patients’ (or occasionally their caregivers’) self-report, which may be of little documentary value. Surprisingly, there have been few data that have examined the accuracy of patients’ reports of age of onset in ET.\r\n\r\nIn ET, dating the onset is not a trivial issue. Indeed, age of onset is a variable of considerable importance. First, late-onset ET could have different biochemical and neuropathological underpinnings from earlier onset ET.[9, 10] Second, as in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease,[11, 12] an association between older age of onset and mild cognitive impairment and dementia has been reported in ET (i.e., ET patients with older age of onset are more likely to have mild cognitive impairment and demented than are ET patients with younger age of onset, and older onset of ET is a risk factor for incident dementia). Third, age of onset is crucial when determining the rate of progression in cross-sectional studies.[9]\r\n\r\nIn this issue of Neuroepidemiology, Louis [13] analyzed the agreement in data on age of onset in 86 patients with ET from a prospective, epidemiological study in New York. Patients with ET cases were assessed at two time points (baseline and follow-up), and data on age of onset were collected each time by self-report. Despite the observation that agreement between the baseline and follow-up reports was high (ρ = 0.85, p 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study are of special interest. Aside from the fact that only a prior pilot study, conducted by the same group, had addressed this reliability issue in ET,[14] there were no other published data to aid clinicians and researchers. The study had several strengths, including the large sample size, the exhaustive study of the patients and the well thought-out approach to the statistical analyses. The study was not without limitations. Specifically, only 86 of 376 ET patients initially enrolled were followed up. However, these 86 enrollees were similar to the larger group of 376 from which they were drawn in terms of baseline tremor severity, baseline tremor duration and baseline age.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside issues of strengths and limitations, the study again demonstrates that age of onset, overall, is reliably reported. Yet investigators should approach these self-reports with some degree of caution. Differences in reported age of onset in ET can vary widely, and in up 1/5 of patients may be substantial. Louis [13] has proposed several approaches to supplement self-reported data in future studies. One approach would be to examine hand-writing samples (e.g., signatures, letters) retrospectively, as an objective record of the possible onset and development of tremor. Another one would be to use collateral history from family members. Despite this, the main question is “when does ET really start”. The answer still remains uncertain. Given the heterogeneous nature of ET,[15] this may differ depending on the cause/s of the syndrome. When and where the neuropathological process develops in ET still remains uncertain.",

      "abstract": "Besides sleep apnea, the main disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness include narcolepsy and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy is characterized by periods of irresistible sleepiness and sleep attacks of brief duration and, most often, by one or more of the auxiliary symptoms: cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnogogic hallucinations. Generally, sleepiness and sleep attacks in hypersomnia are of longer duration and are more resistible than in narcolepsy; also, the auxiliary symptoms are absent. There are three types of hypersomnia: idiopathic, secondary, and periodic. Nocturnal sleep is typically disrupted in narcolepsy, whereas in idiopathic hypersomnia it is prolonged and in secondary hypersomnia it is variable. The exact causes of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are unknown; however, there is evidence for genetic predisposition for either disorder. In secondary hypersomnia causative factors include: neurologic, such as head injuries, cerebrovascular insufficiency, and brain tumors; general medical, such as metabolic disorders, various intoxications, and conditions leading to brain hypoxia; and psychiatric, most notably depression. Although the cause of periodic hypersomnia is unclear, most research supports the notion of underlying organic disease. Often, the evaluation of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness can be completed in the office setting, based on the sleep history and a thorough neurologic, general medical, and psychiatric assessment. Whenever indicated, ancillary laboratory studies, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans, should be performed. Sleep laboratory recordings generally are not necessary unless there is suspicion of sleep apnea or narcolepsy in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Only suppositions are possible with regard to the frequency of childhood's dreams. Most likely only the lighter sleep periods, just after falling asleep, or shortly before awakening, the restless sleep of sickness, are accompanied by vivid dream-fantasies. That such nervous fantasies are especially violent in feverish attacks is a matter of common knowledge. But, quite apart from health, even outer circumstances likely to disturb sleep may affect the child's dream-fantasy by producing terror; of this we have a very plain instance in Hilde. In one case the Scupins could very plainly observe the transition of a real dream-account into a confabulation; at the same time this example is interesting from the wealth of detail in the dream-account.",

L’enuresie nocturne (plus de 2 fois par semaine) toucherait 8 % des enfants de moins de 4 ans et demi et 1,5 % des enfants de moins de 9 ans et demi. Elle peut persister jusqu’a 19 ans… Le NICE rappelle qu’il ne s’agit pas d’une « faute» et que les « punitions » n’ont aucun role therapeutique… Il faut donc d’abord informer les enfants et leurs familles et leur donner des conseils pratiques immediats pour limiter l’impact (protections et vetements de nuit adaptes). Une enuresie recente doit faire rechercher une infection urinaire ou un diabete ; apres quelques mois de possibles facteurs declenchants (maladie recente, trouble emotionnel…) qui peuvent necessiter une prise en charge specifique. L’evaluation est multifactorielle (symptomes de jour, autres problemes, notamment de constipation, troubles du developpement, du comportement, de l’attention ou de l’apprentissage, problemes familiaux…). Une evaluation en milieu specialise peut etre indispensable en cas d’incontinence diurne, d’antecedents d’infection urinaire, d’anomalies congenitales ou de troubles comportementaux majeurs, notamment en cas de suspicion de maltraitance. Le NICE recommande de ne pas restreindre les apports hydriques de la journee, ne pas reveiller l’enfant la nuit, sauf circonstances exceptionnelles, de lui rappeler d’utiliser les toilettes a heures regulieres durant la journee. La place des differents traitements alarmes, desmopressine en premiere intention, recours a un avis specialise en cas d’echec avant utilisation d’anticholinergiques ou d’imipramine, est bien precisee. Le NICE rappelle qu’il est habituellement inutile d’envisager un traitement avant l’âge de 7 ans, meme si certaines mesures peuvent etre envisagees a partir de 5 ans. 1.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders and nightmares are core symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The relationship seems to be bidirectional, and persistent disturbed sleep may influence the course of the disorder. With regard to sleep quality, insomnia and nocturnal anxiety symptoms, as well as nightmares and stressful dreams, are the most prominent sleep symptoms. Polysomnographic measurements reveal alterations of the sleep architecture and fragmentation of rapid eye movement sleep. In addition, sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders and parasomnias are frequent comorbid conditions. The complex etiology and symptomatology of trauma-related sleep disorders with frequent psychiatric comorbidity require the application of multimodal treatment concepts, including psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, there is little empirical evidence on the effectiveness of long-term drug treatment for insomnia and nightmares. For nondrug interventions, challenges arise from the current lack of PTSD-treatment concepts integrating sleep- and trauma-focused therapies. Effective therapy for sleep disturbances may consequently also improve well-being during the day and probably even the course of PTSD. Whether early sleep interventions exert a preventive effect on the development of PTSD remains to be clarified in future studies.",

      "title": "Sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders",
      "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness of sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders. Most of the sleep disturbances in neuromuscular disorders are secondary to sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is commonly associated with a slowly developing chronic respiratory failure, particularly in the advanced stages, but the condition often remains unrecognized and untreated. The most common sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is sleep-related hypoventilation which initially manifests during REM sleep and later as the disease advances, it is also noted during non-REM sleep and even during daytime. In addition to the hypoventilation, central and upper airway obstructive apneas as well as hypopneas occur. Hypoventilation during sleep gives rise to hypoxemia and hypercapnea causing chronic respiratory failure. The abnormal blood gases may later persist during the daytime. Some patients may, however, have sleep onset or maintenance insomnia as a result of associated pain, muscle immobility, contractures, joint pains and muscle cramps as well as anxiety and depression.The commonest complaint in patients with neuromuscular disorders associated with sleep-disordered breathing is excessive daytime somnolence as a result of repeated arousals and sleep fragmentation due to sleep hypoventilation and transient nocturnal hypoxemia. Sleep-disordered breathing causing sleep disturbance is well known in patients with poliomyelitis, postpolio syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease, primary muscle disorders including muscular dystrophies and myotonic dystrophy, congenital or acquired myopathies, neuromuscular junctional disorders and polyneuropathies. All of these conditions may cause weakness of the diaphragm, the intercostal and accessory muscles of respiration causing breathlessness and other respiratory dysrhythmias. As a result of the respiratory and upper airway muscle weakness, the normal sleep-related respiratory physiologic vulnerability becomes pathological in these patients with neuro-muscular disorders causing hypoventilation or central and upper airway obstructive apneas during sleep. Multiple factors are responsible for sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders causing sleep hypoventilation and other respiratory dysrhythmias, and these include: impaired chest bellows, increased work of breathing, hypo-responsive respiratory chemoreceptors, increased upper airway resistance, decreased minute and alveolar ventilation, REM-related marked hypotonia or atonia of the respiratory muscles except the diaphragm, respiratory muscle fatigue and kyphoscoliosis secondary to neuromuscular disorders causing extrapulmonary restriction of the lungs. Nocturnal hypoventilation and chronic respiratory failure in neuromuscular disorders may present insidiously and initially may remain asymptomatic. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed. Clinical clues suggesting sleep-disordered breathing include daytime hypersomnolence, breathlessness, disturbed nocturnal sleep and unexplained leg edema. If the clinical clues strongly suggest sleep-disordered breathing, a physical examination must be directed to uncover bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness. Patients with neuromuscular disorders showing these clinical features must be investigated to uncover nocturnal hypoventilation to prevent serious consequences of chronic.",

Excessive daytime sleepiness is common in individuals experiencing sleep disturbances. The general view of sleep regulation is that two main processes are integrated to control the amount and timing of sleep. Given the heterogenous state of the sleep/wake cycle, supplying an answer to the simple question as to why an organism sleeps is very complex, and several theories have been proposed. Several studies have evaluated the sleep-inducing and sleep-promoting effects of various H3 receptor agonists.

Therefore, management of these insomnias need to include treatments, such as bright light and melatonin, that will retime the circadian rhythms to be more in synchrony with the timing of sleep.",

      "title": "Narcolepsy—Master of Disguise: Evidence-Based Recommendations for Management",
      "abstract": "AbstractNarcolepsy is a neurological disorder affecting the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. It is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and other rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-associated manifestations (eg, hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis). The recognition of this disorder is usually delayed by 10 to 15 years, largely because of its protean manifestations, insidious nature, and lack of physician awareness. Delayed diagnosis is associated with poor quality of life, depression, and increased likelihood of accidents. Health care providers should include narcolepsy in the differential diagnosis of patients with excessive sleepiness, chronic fatigue, sleep-disordered breathing, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Narcolepsy is a lifelong disorder that often requires pharmacological treatments, which may include wake-promoting stimulants for excessive sleepiness and γ-hydroxybutyrate (sodium oxybate) and antidepressants for REM sleep-associated manifestations. This article presents a case of a 47-year-old man with long-standing sleepiness and cataplexy who was eventually diagnosed with narcolepsy 30 years after the first onset of symptoms. The presenting manifestations of narcolepsy, diagnostic criteria, and its management are also discussed.Keywords: narcolepsyhypersomniasleepinesscataplexyREM sleep",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are unexpected and undesirable motor activities during sleep. Parasomnias may occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Nightmare disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM behavior disorder (RBD), and status dissociatus (agrypnia excitata) are some of the REM parasomnias. Parasomnia overlap syndrome is a term used for parasomnias that occur in both REM and NREM sleep stages, such as catathrenia. RBD is a parasomnia that occurs during REM sleep stage and is characterized by acting out dreams (oneirism), leading to unwanted motor actions such as kicking, punching, or slapping, or sudden abrupt movements that can cause unexplained injuries to self or bedpartner. Memory of the associated dream is usually preserved. Diagnosis is obtained via video polysomnography with findings of REM activity without atonia and video recording of the oneirism. Treatment starts with developing a safety plan, improving sleep hygiene, and identifying any medications or other triggers such as snoring or leg movements. Melatonin, benzodiazepines, and a few other medications are used for treatment of RBD and other REM parasomnias. [ Psychiatr Ann . 2021;51(12):560–565.]",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Developmental stammering, regardless of country or language, affects one per cent of adult populations. Exacerbation by the stress of adult conversation or public speaking contrasts sharply with normal flow during singing, acting or conversation with children. Alterations in regional cerebral blood flow suggest that there are underlying differences in sensorimotor function in developmental stammerers whose symptoms commonly appear during the period of intensive language acquisition around the third and fourth year. Emotional tensions may exacerbate the disturbance, but equally psychological growth is adversely affected by the handicap. Abnormal motor control is confirmed by the exaggerated activity in the right hemisphere. The normal sequence of articulatory programming and motor preparation for single word reading is reversed. Absence of activation over the left auditory cortex supports the notion of impaired or diminished auditory feedback in the self-monitoring of speech seen in normal brains. Subcortical abnormalities are a feature of both developmental and acquired stammering.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are highly prevalent during childhood and adolescence. It is known that if left untreated, these problems can have significant impact on daytime function, including learning, memory, attention, and behavior. The approach to the treatment of these disorders (whether with or without pharmacotherapy) is dependent on a thorough evaluation of the sleep complaint and determination of an accurate diagnosis. Many pediatric sleep problems are due to insomnia. There is good evidence that young children with behaviorally based insomnia respond to appropriate behavioral interventions. There is less research evidence of the efficacy of these interventions in children who are either school age or adolescents; however, nonpharmacologic strategies are usually indicated initially in the approach to treatment. The indication for the use of pharmacotherapy in pediatric insomnia is not well understood; however, some general principles are described when medications may be considered. There are specific sleep disorders (other than insomnia) for which pharmacotherapy plus behavioral strategies are warranted. The research regarding pharmacotherapy in pediatric sleep disorders is limited; often, medications are used \"off label\" based on data extrapolated from adult studies. Clinicians who suggest over-the-counter treatments or prescribe medications for pediatric patients with sleep disorders should have an understanding of the classification of sleep disorders and the role of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of these disorders. In this chapter, the emphasis is on the pharmacologic treatment of sleep disorders in typically developing children and adolescents.",

Il notare, a volte, nei bambini affetti da enuresi primitiva la concomitanza di piccoli disturbi psichici o emozionali, di piccolo male, di stati di ipervagotonia o spasmofilia, conferma la natura funzionale complessa dell'affezione, sulla quale influiscono in prevalenza turbe della vita psichica o degli interessi affettivi del bambino. Alcuni dei fattori psichici implicati nell'enuresi (mancinismo, infantilismo nei giochi o discorsi, terrori notturni, fobie) possono anche essere considerati come indice di una incompleta maturazione psichica. Non vogliamo qui discutere sull'etiopatogenesi della malattia, che è tuttora piuttosto oscura. La maggioranza degli autori considera l'enuresi primitiva come un disturbo funzionale complesso, non legato ad alterazioni dell'innervazione o della maturazione delle strutture nervose e muscolari preposte alla funzione vescicale, ma piuttosto riportabile ad alterazioni (o ritardo) del meccanismo volontario della minzione. Si parla di enuresi primitiva quando il controllo anche notturno della minzione non è stato raggiunto entro i primi tre anni di vita. Secondo Harrison (1967), a 5 anni l'enuresi è presente nel 15% dei maschi e nel 10% delle femmine, a 9 anni nel 5%. Il disturbo cessa spontaneamente alla pubertà in quasi tutti i casi.",

L’association avec les troubles du sommeil est décrite chez 25 % à 50 % des enfants et chez plus de la moitié des adultes présentant un TDA/H. La question de cette comorbidité pose question. En effet, Il n’est pas clair à l’heure actuelle si les troubles du sommeil sont intrinsèques au TDA/H ou s’ils se produisent à la suite d’un trouble primaire du sommeil sous-jacent. En effet, il est décrit des symptômes de « type TDA/H » dans certains troubles du sommeil primaires tels que les troubles respiratoires du sommeil, les mouvements périodiques des membres pendant le sommeil et le syndrome des jambes sans repos. De plus, la somnolence diurne excessive (l’un des symptômes de la narcolepsie et l’hypersomnie idiopathique) peut « mimer » des symptômes de TDA/H. Dès lors, la similitude de certains symptômes peut conduire à des erreurs diagnostiques entre troubles primaires du sommeil et TDA/H. Ainsi, nous nous proposons lors de ce symposium de faire un point sur les liens entre troubles du sommeil et TDA/H chez l’adulte : – en effectuant tout d’abord une revue de la littérature explorant la comorbidité entre ces différents troubles. Puis en présentant ensuite deux études originales sur ce thème en population adulte : – explorant d’une part, la comorbidité des hypersomnies (hypersomnie idiopathique et narcolepsie) chez les adultes TDA/H et la comorbidité TDA/H chez des adultes hypersomniaques ; – d’autre part, en explorant la somnolence diurne excessive objective par un test de maintien de l’éveil en population adulte TDA/H et l’impact de cette somnolence sur les performances de conduite des sujets (sur simulateur de conduite).",

      "abstract": "Sudden death is natural death, heralded by loss of consciousness within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms. The time and mode of death are unexpected. This definition is meant to satisfy medical and scientific considerations as well legal and social concerns. Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

      "abstract": "Neurogenic bladder dysfunction, resulted from demage to the neural structures in spinal lesion present a major problem for the patient, his environment and health care workers. Proper diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction allows you to implement appropriate treatment plan that will allow adequate emptying and prevention of complications that may endanger the patient's life. The evolution of spinal cord injuries can distinguish three phases: 1) spinal shock phase, 2) the recovery phase, 3) final phase. After spinal trauma bladder is affected mostly in two ways: 1) Spastic (reflex) bladder caused in lesion above voiding center (S2-S4 segments), 2) Flaccid (atonic) neuropathic bladder emerges in lesion at the voiding center (S2-S4) or below it, as well as lesions of the peripheral innervation of bladder, 3) Autonomic disreflection syndrome develops in patient with cervical or high thoracic spinal cord lesions, above the Th 1 segment, 4) Uninhibited neurogenic bladder develops in incomplete nerve pathway lesions in cerebral cortex, pyramidal pathway or in spinal cord-cerebral voiding control debilitate. The diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is established by urodynamic examination, laboratory blood and urine findings as well as radiographic, computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal column. Bladder emptyng can be made by intermitetnt catheterization, Crede's procedure, suprapubic stimulation, smooth bladder muscle electrostimulation and by medications. The necessity of an Interdisciplinary approach to the treatment of these patients indicates all hardness in spinal cord injury patientes and consequent bladder dysfuncion.",

      "abstract": "The term coma is used to refer to patients whose eyes are permanently closed and who cannot be awakened nor are in a functioning state.(1) According to Zasler,(2) coma is a state in which there is no meaningful response. Comatose patients normally maintain their eyes closed without evidence of opening spontaneously or to external stimuli, do not follow instructions, do not show goal-directed or voluntary conduct, do not speak and cannot sustain looking or tracking movements of more than a 45˚ angle. Excluded are secondary neurobehavioral signs and symptoms in coma that have been treated pharmacologically with sedatives. The definition of coma in terms of cerebral functioning refers to a state of acute brain failure not strictly related to any particular cerebral substratum or specific anatomical level of lesion. Coma normally occurs when broad areas in the upper and lower brain stems, or cerebral hemispheres, or simultaneously in the cerebral hemispheres and brain stem are damaged. The most frequent causes of coma are diffuse axonal pathology, hypoxia and secondary lesions which affect the brainstem (Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4).",

      "abstract": "The circadian system is synchronized to the light-dark cycle generated by the rotation of the earth, ensuring that wake¬fulness is during the day and sleep occurs at night. However, the sleep-wake rhythm may be out of sync with the light-dark cycle or endogenously out of sync, resulting in insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in activities of daily living. Sleep disorders are classified by the American Sleep Disorders Association, as intrinsic dyssomnias, extrinsic dyssomnias, parasomnias, or medical/psychiatric sleep disorders. Circa¬dian sleep disorders have been categorized separately to recognize that in most cases the etiology of circadian dis¬turbances is a mix of internal and environmental factors or a temporary mismatch between the two. Symptoms are usually insomnia or hypersomnia, common symptoms in patients with circadian sleep disorders although other causes can be attributed and must be excluded before a diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder is made. In the patient without other sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool in assessing circadian sleep disorders. These records should be kept for 2 weeks or more, as a disturbance due to job changes or travel across time zones can have effects on sleep and daytime alertness weeks after the event.

      "abstract": "Objective: The chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debated clinical entity, not presently associated with specific sleep abnormalities. However, higher levels of deep sleep and/or lower levels of light sleep have been reported in several all-night polysomnography studies in CFS patients. This distribution of Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (NREMS) contrasts with what would be expected if sleep was interrupted by microawakenings, such as in sleep apneas or periodic limb movements, where more light sleep and less deep sleep are commonly observed. This \"paradoxical\" distribution of NREMS could represent a characteristic feature of chronic fatigue and deserved to be investigated.Methods: A retrospective comparison of the NREMS distribution was performed between 28 \"pure\" Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients (without primary sleep or psychiatric disorders), 27 Apneic-Hypopneic patients and 27 Healthy Controls.Results: Data showed CFS patients to have a higher stage 4/stage 2 or stage 4/light sleep ratios than the other two conditions.Conclusion: This sleep pattern is closer to what is observed in cases of infections than to what is seen after sleep fragmentation by primary sleep or in psychiatric disorders. Such a particular sleep pattern could provide insights into the pathophysiology of fatigue.",

      "abstract": "The state of sleep consists of different phases that proceed in successive, tightly regulated order through the night forming a physiological program, which for each individual is different but stabile from one night to another. Failure to accomplish this program results in feeling of unrefreshing sleep and tiredness in the morning. The program core is constructed by genetic factors but regulated by circadian rhythm and duration and intensity of day time brain activity. Many environmental factors modulate sleep, including stress, health status and ingestion of vigilance-affecting nutrients or medicines (e.g. caffeine). Acute sleep loss results in compromised cognitive performance, memory deficits, depressive mood and involuntary sleep episodes during the day. Moreover, prolonged sleep curtailment has many adverse health effects, as evidenced by both epidemiological and experimental studies. These effects include increased risk for depression, type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to voluntary restriction of sleep, shift work, irregular working hours, jet lag and stress are important factors that induce curtailed or bad quality sleep and/or insomnia. This review covers the current theories on the function of normal sleep and describes current knowledge on the physiologic effects of sleep loss. It provides insights into the basic mechanisms of the regulation of wakefulness and sleep creating a theoretical background for understanding different disturbances of sleep.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

Visit to a somnologist at the University Clinic. Complaints were mainly made by the patient’s wife, since the patient himself does not remember these episodes. According to the wife, sudden sweeping movements of the arms and legs, incoherent speech are noted during sleep, then the patient gets up, can grab his hands, behaves aggressively, shifts things. These complaints have been noted for more than 10 years, with a gradual worsening of symptoms. A neurologist at the place of residence suggested a possible epileptic nature of these episodes,but no further examination was carried out. Results. From a semiological point of view, motor phenomena during sleep can imitate epileptic seizures, parasomnias, rapid eye movement behavior disorders, and normal sleep motor phenomena such as fragmentary sleep myoclonus, periodic limb movements, bruxism, etc. A differential diagnostic search is provided, a comparative characteristic of motor phenomena during sleep and wakefulness is given, as well as a scale of frontal epilepsy and parasomnia, which can help the doctor in making the correct diagnosis. Conclusion. Conducting a comprehensive examination of the patient and clarifying the clinical diagnosis made it possible to choose the correct management tactics, avoid unjustified prescription of antiepileptic drugs, and reduce emotional stress in the family due to the ambiguity of the manifestations of night motor phenomena. The established clinical diagnosis allows monitoring the patient in terms of the possible debut of a neurodegenerative disease.",

This sleep disorder is a final common pathway for many people who initially develop sleeplessness in the context of acute stressors (e.g., pain, job loss), but then acquire a form of \"learned\" sleeplessness as they become increasingly overconcerned about their unsatisfying sleep patterns. Patients report reduced total sleep time, with increased sleep latency (greater than 30 min), or increased wakeafter sleep onset time, though these findings are not always corroborated on PSG studies. Patients with this form of chronic insomnia are often vexed by its seemingly unpredictable nature from night to night, but to be diagnosed symptoms must be present on three or more nights per week, for more than 1 month (DSM-IV) or 6 months (ICSD-2). The essential feature of this form of insomnia is a pattern of sleep disturbance that evolves over time as a result of psychological distress that triggers unhelpful behaviors and physiological arousal. This chapter will summarize the current understanding of the development of this disorder, and the clinical approaches that may be useful to resolve it.",

Particularly, the sleep bruxism is a frequent phenomenon that causes cephalalgia and muscular/joint pains to the awakening, besides an increased dental abrasion and sensibility. The etiology of sleep bruxism is uncertain: while the occlusal discrepancies and the anatomy of the bony structures of the orofacial region play only a minor role, others factors, like smoking, alcohol, drugs, systemic diseases, stress, trauma and heredity, appear to have an important role in the sleep bruxism genesis. Recent polysomnographic studies, suggest that sleep bruxism episodes are part of an sleep arousal response. The sleep arousal response is a sudden change in the depth of sleep. Besides the sleep bruxism appears to be an disturbance in the dopaminergic system. Further psychological factors (like stress, anxiety) are implicated in the aetiology of sleep bruxism as well. The aim of this paper is to review the literature on the aetiology of bruxism.",

      "title": "Stress and cognition",
      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

Sexual dysfunction as well as iatrogenic hypersexuality may be deleterious for the couple well-being. Symptomatic postural hypotension is the main manifestation of autonomic failure and needs a specific management. Pain is frequent in Parkinson's disease, particularly due to frozen shoulder or to the peculiar picture of \"primary sensory pain symptoms\".

      "title": "Does the Patient Have Excessive Daytime Sleepiness?",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is defined as difficulty staying awake during the usual waking hours. The prevalence of EDS is estimated to be 18–20% in the United States. EDS may occur as a result of numerous conditions, including insufficient sleep or other central disorders of hypersomnolence, sleep-related breathing disorders, medications or substances, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, psychiatric or neurological disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, pregnancy, and various metabolic disorders and medical conditions. True sleepiness is the propensity to fall asleep and is not synonymous with fatigue or always associated with decreased vigilance. Excessive self-reported subjective sleepiness on validated scales such as the ESS may be useful for suggesting the presence of a possible sleep disorder requiring evaluation. However, patients may misinterpret fatigue associated with medical and psychiatric conditions as sleepiness or have an inaccurate perception of the degree of their sleepiness. Objective tests of sleepiness may be helpful to determine whether an abnormal propensity to fall asleep is present. The assessment and diagnosis of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is usually made based on a combination of sleep history, past medical, psychiatric, surgical, and family history, a physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests.",

      "title": "Age Related Changes in Sleep and Circadian Physiology: From Brain Mechanisms to Sleep Behavior",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Sleep and circadian physiology change in healthy older adults independent of medical conditions or medications (1-3). In general, deep nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is reduced, there are more awakenings from sleep, and the time spent awake in bed trying to sleep is increased. Such sleep disruptions are exacerbated by age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease (4), cancer (5,6), nocturia (7), pain (4,8), diabetes (8,9), and depression (10,11). It is estimated that 40% to 70% of older adults experience chronic sleep problems, and that about 50% of the cases are untreated by primary care physicians (12). Sleep problems are even more common in geriatric patients with dementia (13,14). Aging with and without associated medical problems is also associated with changes in the physiology of the internal circadian timekeeping system that regulates near-24-hour rhythms in human physiology and behavior; and age-related changes in circadian physiology are thought to contribute to sleep problems (14-17). This chapter will first review sleep-wakefulness and circadian neurophysiology. Knowledge of the brain regions involved in promoting sleep and wakefulness states can provide perspective on how medications commonly used in the geriatric patient can affect daytime and nighttime function. This discussion will be followed by a review of how sleep and circadian brain regulatory systems change with aging. Knowledge of age-related changes in sleep and circadian systems may promote a better understanding of potential mechanisms underlying sleep problems in the geriatric patient and may help to inform the development of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment strategies.",

      "title": "Risk of traffic accident injury after benzodiazepine use",
      "abstract": "The pharmacological management of insomnia has lately become a challenge for researchers worldwide. As per the third International Classification of Sleep disorders (ICSD-3) insomnia can be defined as a state with repeated difficulty in sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and results in some form of daytime impairment. The conventional treatments approved for management of insomnia were benzodiazepines (BZDs) (estazolam, quazepam, triazolam, flurazepam and temazepam) and non-BZDs, also known as z-drugs (zaleplon, zolpidem, and eszopiclone), tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) doxepin as well as melatonin agonists, e.g. ramelteon. But the potential of these agents to address sleep problems has been limited due to substantial side effects associated with them like hangover, dependence and tolerance, rebound insomnia, muscular atonia, inhibition of respiratory system, cognitive dysfunctions, and increased anxiety. Recently, orexin neuropeptides have been identified as regulators of transition between wakefulness and sleep and documented to aid an initial transitory effect towards wakefulness by activating cholinergic/monoaminergic neural pathways of the ascending arousal system. This has led to the development of orexin peptides and receptors, as possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of sleep disorders with the advantage of having lesser side effects as compared to conventional treatments. The present review focuses on the orexin peptides and receptors signifying their physiological profile as well as the development of orexin receptor antagonists as novel strategies in sleep medicine.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT It is estimated that 45% of individuals with cognitive impairment experience sleep disturbances prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms. Assessing sleeping problems and enhancing sleep quality are critical first steps to reduce the risk of cognitive impairment. Objective: To review existing literature based on predefined eligibility criteria to understand the connection between sleep disturbance and Alzheimer's disease. Methods: A thorough and systematic evaluation of numerous studies was carried out to assess one or more of the following epidemiological factors: (1) sleep disorders, (2) cognitive impairment, and (3) risk estimates for cognitive impairment due to sleep. Results: Studies suggest that individuals who experience memory loss may encounter sleep disturbances before noticing other symptoms. Numerous sleep disorders, such as excessive and inadequate sleep duration, poor sleep quality, circadian rhythm abnormalities, insomnia, and obstructive sleep apnea were found to increase the risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Additionally, lower sleep quality and shorter sleep duration have been linked to higher cerebral-β-amyloid levels. Objective evidence for the development of cognitive impairment is provided by the architecture of sleep stages. Patients experiencing sleep problems may benefit from specific types of sleep medicine as a preventative measure against cognitive decline. Conclusion: Sleep disorders can have adverse effects on cognitive health. The duration and quality of sleep are fundamental factors for maintaining a healthy brain as we age. Proper sleep can aid prevent cognitive impairment, particularly Alzheimer's disease and dementia.",

The non-oxygenating or fainting games, which consist of mechanical compressions or strangulative mechanisms. These are performed in the search of pseudo-hallucinogenic sensations. There are several such games: from the simple but non-the-less dangerous \"tomato game\", performed by younger children (from 3-4 years of age), to the \"choking game\", between 7 and 14 years of age. \"Aggressive\" or \"violent\" games which use physical and psychological violence from a group of people towards a single individual. Acute neurological complications can be the consequence of such games, and their degree depends on the duration and intensity of the strangulation. These can vary from cerebral edema, loss of consciousness, long term cerebral damage (deafness, blindness, bedridden), irreversible coma and death. Physical consequences of aggressive games are equally important, such as vertebral fractures, cranial trauma, organ rupture. Victims of violence present repeated psycho-traumatic manifestations. Preventive messages associate information on the risks of such games with civic education (listening, solidarity and trust in others), the development of psychological and social skills, an active involvement in school-life and concrete responsibility taking. Early identification of symptoms of these practices by family members and professionals helps to avoid their repetition and increased danger, even addictive patterns.Pratiques et jeux dangereux en milieu scolaire. Les pratiques dangereuses en cour d’école sont multiples. Les jeux dits de non-oxygénation ou d’évanouissement consistent, par un mécanisme de compression ou de strangulation, à rechercher certaines sensations pseudo-hallucinatoires. Les jeux dits d’agression ou jeux violents utilisent la violence physique ou psychologique de manière gratuite d’un groupe de jeunes envers une personne seule. Leur caractère répétitif dans le temps définit le harcèlement. La durée et l’intensité de la strangulation peuvent induire des complications neurologiques aiguës (oedème cérébral, perte de connaissance prolongée), des lésions cérébrales définitives (surdité, cécité, état grabataire), un coma irréversible, le décès. Les conséquences physiques des jeux d’agression sont très lourdes : fractures de la colonne vertébrale, traumatismes crâniens, ruptures d’organes. Les enfants victimes ont des manifestations psychotraumatiques répétées. Les messages de prévention associent, outre une information sur les risques, une éducation à la citoyenneté (écoute, cohésion, solidarité, confiance en l’autre), le développement de compétences psychologiques et sociales de l’enfant, une implication active du jeune dans la vie scolaire et la prise de responsabilités concrètes. Le repérage par les familles et les professionnels de symptômes chroniques évocateurs de ces pratiques permet d’éviter leur répétition et leur dangerosité encore accrue, voire un passage à l’addiction.",

La hiperactividad es un trastorno del desarrollo de la conducta caracterizado por una actividad motora disruptiva que impide que el individuo establezca los lazos sociales adecuados y se comunique con normalidad, parte esencial del desarrollo global del nino. Es un sintoma inespecifico de diversos trastornos neurocognitivos. El mas frecuente es el trastorno por deficit de atencion con hiperactividad (TDAH). Pacientes y metodos. Se presenta el resultado de dos investigaciones. En la primera de ellas, un estudio caso-control, se analizo de forma comparativa como recuerdan el comportamiento de sus hijos durante los primeros 12 meses de vida los padres de 50 ninos diagnosticados de TDAH. Se separo la sintomatologia en 3 perfiles clinicos (irritabilidad diurna, trastornos en las conductas alimentarias y disfunciones del sueno). Hasta el 33% de las familias referia antecedentes de alguno de ellos. El 41% de los ninos fueron descritos como excesivamente inquietos, llorones o irritables, y muy sensibles a los ruidos y sobresaltos, y el 42,7% tuvo dificultad para dormirse o manifesto sueno intermitente y despertares con llanto. Para el segundo proyecto de investigacion, complementario al anterior, se diseno una encuesta anamnesica que respondieron los padres de 78 pacientes diagnosticados de TDAH.

      "title": "Defining, Assessing, and Treating Adolescent Insomnia and Related Sleep Problems",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a time of change with many of these changes influencing sleep intrinsically and volitionally. Neuroendocrine and structural changes to the brain result in adolescents experiencing a delay in their circadian phase. Despite their intrinsic delay and progressively later bedtimes, adolescents' sleep need of 9.2 h remains stable as they develop. Female adolescents experience an increased risk for insomnia following menarche onset. Associations between the menstrual cycle and sleep disturbances have been found in studies of adult women, but more research needs to fully explore this relationship in adolescent females. Along with biological changes, adolescents experience an increase in social demands and responsibilities as they mature. The result is adaptation of the \"typical\" adolescent sleep schedule. For many adolescents, this new schedule results in a truncation of their sleep time that creates a sleep debt never fully repaid on the weekends. Numerous studies note a reduction in total sleep time following the transition into adolescence, particularly during the school year. The numerous factors that present during adolescence place adolescents at a greater risk for sleep disorders like insomnia, delayed sleep phase disorder, inadequate sleep hygiene, and behavioral sleep restriction. These disorders are associated with daytime consequences like daytime sleepiness, depressed mood, attention/concentration difficulties, and academic difficulties. The current chapter highlights insomnia, delayed sleep phase disorder, inadequate sleep hygiene, and behavioral sleep restriction with a focus on defining, assessing, differentiating, and treatment.",

We aimed to provide the first detailed assessment of sleep disorders and their correlates in patients with early psychosis. Sixty outpatients aged between 18 and 30 with nonaffective psychosis were assessed for sleep disorder presence, severity, and treatment using a structured diagnostic interview, sleep diaries, and actigraphy. Psychotic experiences, mood, and psychological wellbeing were also measured. Forty-eight patients (80%) had at least one sleep disorder, with insomnia and nightmare disorder being the most common. Comorbidity of sleep disorders within this group was high, with an average of 3.3 sleep disorders per patient. Over half of the sleep disorders had been discussed with a clinician but almost three-quarters had received no treatment. Treatment according to clinical guidelines was rare, occurring in only 8% of cases (n = 13). Sleep disorders were significantly associated with increased psychotic experiences, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and lower quality of life. Sleep disorders are very common in patients with psychosis, may have wide-ranging negative effects, and merit routine assessment and treatment in psychiatric practice.",

Acute precipitants for delirium include administration of psychoactive medications (particularly benzodiazepines, narcotics, anticholinergic medications, and general anesthesia), sleep deprivation, major surgery, and new illness or worsening of current illness.Delirium accounts for some 49% of all hospital days in older patients, increases rates of mortality and morbidity, and is associated with lasting cognitive impairment after discharge, even in younger patients.",

      "abstract": "Delirium Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness (awareness of the person' s environment) characterized by altered or shifting mental status and inattention (reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention).There are also changes in cognition (basic mental functions) such as memory impairment, disorientation to time or place, and language disturbance.There also may be disturbances of perception (accurate appreciation of the environment) such as hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not actually there), abnormal speech, abnormal movements (including tremors or picking at clothing), disruptive or violent behavior, and sudden shifts in emotions.To qualify for a diagnosis of delirium, the signs and symptoms must have a short onset (over a period of hours or days) and change over the course of the day.It is important to make a clear distinction between delirium and dementia (such as Alzheimer disease).Dementia is a disturbance in intellectual (thinking) functions and memory that is usually gradually progressive over a long period.Having delirium along with another medical illness can significantly increase a person' s chance of dying of that illness.It is important for doctors to identify delirium so that it can be treated to improve the person' s overall prognosis.The August 18, 2010, issue of JAMA includes an article about diagnosing delirium.This Patient Page is based on one previously published in the December 24/31, 2008, issue of JAMA.",

      "abstract": "Auteur(s) : Christian Derouesne La troisieme conference internationale sur la demence a corps de Lewy (DCL) [1] reconnait les difficultes du diagnostic liees a la faible sensibilite des criteres utilises. Deux elements y concourent : la difficile appreciation des fluctuations cognitives, elements cles du diagnostic, et de la faible frequence de conjonction des trois criteres principaux qui semble liee a la presence d’une pathologie de type Alzheimer associee. Les criteres proposes pour un diagnostic de DCL probable sont : 1) la presence des trois signes majeurs : fluctuations cognitives avec des variations prononcees de l’attention et de la vigilance ; hallucinations visuelles recurrentes et detaillees ; presence de signes parkinsoniens spontanes ; 2) la presence de 1 ou plus des signes majeurs s’il existe 1 ou plus signes suggestifs. Le diagnostic de DCL possible peut etre porte chez un sujet dement, en l’absence de signes majeurs, devant 1 ou plus des signes suggestifs suivants : 1) troubles du sommeil paradoxal que traduit une agitation nocturne (les patients « agissent leurs reves ») ; 2) severe sensibilite aux neuroleptiques ; 3) mise en evidence d’un deficit dopaminergique dans les noyaux gris par la tomoscinigraphie. D’autres signes sont communs mais manquent de specificite : 1) signes de dysautonomie : hypotension orthostatique, chutes ou syncopes, instabilite neurocardiovasculaire, incontinence urinaire, impuissance, constipation ; 2) delire systematise ; 3) hallucinations autres que visuelles ; 4) depression ; 5) relative preservation des structures temporales internes en IRM ; 6) ralentissement diffus a l’EEG ; 7) hypoperfusion cerebrale generalisee, notamment dans les regions occipitales. Au plan neuropsychologique, la differenciation avec la MA repose sur une double dissociation : dans la DCL, la preservation relative de la denomination, du rappel a court et moyen terme comme de la reconnaissance contraste avec l’alteration de la fluence verbale, de la perception visuelle et des performances visuospatiales. Pour diminuer les difficultes d’appreciation des fluctuations, les auteurs recommandent d’utiliser les echelles de fluctuations cognitives proposees par Walker et al. [2] (la Clinician assessment of fluctuation scale necessite toutefois une plus grande expertise que la One day fluctuation assessement scale) ou la Mayo fluctuations composite scale pour differencier les fluctuations de la DCL de celles qui sont observees dans la MA [3]. Les criteres histopathologiques sont precises, notamment la quantification des lesions de type Alzheimer. L’article se conclut sur l’interet d’un traitement combine par les inhibiteurs de la cholinesterase et les dopaminergiques [4]. Quant a la question des rapports entre demence parkinsonienne (definie par l’apparition d’une demence chez un parkinsonien de longue date) et la DC (dans laquelle les signes parkinsoniens ne doivent pas avoir precede la demence de plus de 1 an), le consortium considere que cette distinction doit etre maintenue pour des raisons cliniques, mais qu’au niveau de la recherche, clinicopathologique ou therapeutique, les deux phenotypes peuvent etre reunis sous le terme de maladie a corps de Lewy ou alpha-synucleinopathie ! 1. McKeith IG, Dickson DW, Lowe J, Emre M, O’Brien JT, Feldman H, et al.

      "abstract": "Definition of stroke In epidemiological studies, stroke is defined by clinical findings and symptoms [1]: rapidly developed signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours (unless interrupted by surgery or death), with no apparent cause other than a vascular origin. This approach is supplemented with neuroimaging but even with advanced imaging techniques the diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Therefore, precise definitions of clinical signs are needed. WHO definitions are [1]: Definite focal signs: unilateral or bilateral motor impairment (including dyscoordination) unilateral or bilateral sensory impairment aphasis/dysphasis (non-fluent speech) hemianopia (half-sided impairment of visual fields) diplopia forced gaze (conjugate deviation) dysphagia of acute onset apraxia of acute onset ataxia of acute onset perception deficit of acute onset. Not acceptable as sole evidence of focal dysfunction: dizziness, vertigo localized headache blurred vision of both eyes dysarthria (slurred speech) impaired cognitive function (including confusion) impaired consciousness seizures. (Although strokes can present in this way, these signs are not specific and cannot therefore be accepted as definite evidence of stroke.) Neuroimaging studies are needed for classification of stroke by subtypes: subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain infarction (necrosis). Although there may be large variations in stroke subtype distributions between populations, thrombotic and embolic strokes are responsible for about 80–85% of all strokes in the Indo-European populations, and as low as 65% in some Asian populations. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represents 5–10% of all strokes, and occurs more often in younger subjects, while both intracerebral and especially thrombotic and embolic stroke increase markedly with age.",

The SCN aligns whole-body cellular, behavioral and phenomenological processes with the Earth’s 24-hour day/night rhythm. When disruptions to the SCN’s perceptual system occur (e.g., “jet-lag,” prolonged waking, chronic exposure to light at night or habit change as the result of becoming a parent), disrupted melatonin and glucocorticoid secretion can lead to widespread dysregulation of sleep and circadian cycling. The effects of circadian disruptions are often compounded by the homeostatic sleep drive, wherein sleep pressure accumulates with protracted wakefulness to affect mood, cognition, health and well-being.",

      "abstract": "Nocturia arises from a fundamental mismatch between nocturnal urine production, storage capacity, and sleep architecture, which may be driven by abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, but also by sleep disorders, medical diseases, patient actions/lifestyle factors, or medications. This article introduces a novel system for organizing the complex differential diagnosis for nocturia, as proposed by an international collective of practicing urologists, physician specialists, and sleep experts: \"Sleep CALM\"-Sleep Disorders, Comorbidities, Actions, Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction, and Medications.Narrative review of current evidence regarding the relevance of each \"Sleep CALM\" factor to nocturia pathogenesis, evaluation, and management.Nocturia and sleep disorders are highly intertwined and often bidirectional, such that nocturnal awakenings for reasons other than a sensation of bladder fullness should not be used as grounds for exclusion from nocturia treatment, but rather leveraged to broaden therapeutic options for nocturia. Nocturia is an important potential harbinger of several serious medical conditions beyond the genitourinary tract. Urologists should have a low threshold for primary care and medical specialty referral for medical optimization, which carries the potential to significantly improve nocturnal voiding frequency in addition to overall health status. Adverse patient actions/lifestyle factors, lower urinary tract dysfunction, and medication use commonly coexist with disordered sleep and comorbid medical conditions, and may be the primary mediators of nocturia severity and treatment response, or further exacerbate nocturia severity and complicate treatment.\"Sleep CALM\" provides a memorable and clinically relevant means by which to structure the initial patient history, physical exam, and clinical testing in accordance with current best-practice guidelines for nocturia. Although not intended as an all-encompassing diagnostic tool, the \"Sleep CALM\" schema may also be useful in guiding individualized ancillary testing, identifying the need for specialty referral and multidisciplinary care, and uncovering first-line treatment targets.",

It is a long-standing problem for individuals. Symptoms may worsen with stressful life circumstances. Prognosis is dependent on accurately diagnosing the NES along with any coexisting disorders. The relationship between sleep disorders and eating behaviors is of considerable scientific interest and an area of active investigation and evolving conceptualization. Patients with NES eat most of their calories after the evening meal. They eat “in order to sleep”, and each eating episode is generally shorter and involves fewer calories.",

      "title": "Searching for the Brain Bases of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and napping are all highly prevalent among the elderly, reflecting changes in sleep architecture, sleep efficiency, sleep quality, and circadian sleep-wake cycles. Insomnia is sometimes associated with subjective daytime sleepiness, as well as other clinical and socioeconomic consequences. The daytime sleepiness will at times lead to napping. Although napping is viewed as a common age-related occurrence, little is known about its benefits or consequences. Factors reported to be contributors to daytime napping include sleep-maintenance difficulty and sleep fragmentation with consequent daytime sleepiness, nighttime use of long-acting sedating agents, daytime use of sedating medications, and dementia. However, a correlation between sleep disturbance and daytime napping has not been consistently observed. Whether napping is beneficial, neutral, or detrimental is an important issue, in light of conflicting findings regarding the impact of daytime napping on nighttime sleep and recent reports of an association between napping and adverse clinical outcomes, including increased mortality risk. Further research is needed to determine whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between napping and insomnia, and between napping and adverse clinical outcomes, and to explore the clinical implications of improving insomnia and reducing daytime napping. Clinical evaluations of hypnotic agents should assess efficacy for both improving insomnia symptoms (particularly sleep-maintenance difficulty, in the case of elderly patients) and reducing daytime sleepiness thatwould lead to inadvertent napping.",

Abarca una serie de conductas disfuncionales relacionadas con la ingestion alimentaria como pueden ser: tragar sin masticar la comida, negarse a comer, vomitar la comida o masticar con excesiva lentitud. Es-tos tipos de problemas angustian a los padres de manera desmesurada en muchas ocasiones. Con cierta frecuencia no saben como abordarlo, con lo que intentan multiples maneras de solucionarlo, entre las que se encuentran un peregrinaje por distintos especialistas y la consecuente realizacion de multiples pruebas medicas asi como una medicalizacion innecesaria, que en la mayoria de las oca-siones resultan infructuosas.Esta problematica es bastante frecuente en la infancia. Manikam y Perman (2) afirman que mas del 25 por ciento de los ninos presentan conductas dificiles relacionadas con la alimentacion, llegando hasta el 80 por ciento en ninos con dificultades ambientales. En un estudio llevado a cabo en Londres (3) con ninos de tres anos de edad, se encontro que el 16 por ciento mostraba, poco apetito y el 12 por ciento eran caprichosos con los alimentos. No se encontraron diferencias entre sexos. Los problemas se mantuvieron en dos tercios de los ninos al ano siguiente y en un tercio tres anos despues.Normalmente este tipo de trastornos de la conducta alimentaria requiere de dos tipos de intervenciones es-pecificas: 1. La instauracion de habitos alimentarios “adecua-dos” y su mantenimiento. Cambiando el patron relacional que se establece entre el nino y el cui-dador principal durante el acto de la alimentacion.2. Modificacion de las creencias de los padres acerca de la alimentacion del nino (4). En muchas ocasio-nes el problema se situa en creencias erroneas por parte de los padres acerca de lo que es adecuado o no comer o sobre la idea de delgadez.Este tipo de patologias alimentarias normalmente no suponen un riesgo vital para el menor, pero si pueden ocasionar diferentes desajustes en el desarrollo person-al y en la propia configuracion de la dinamica familiar. Asi en muchos hogares son motivo de discusion entre los progenitores, de disputas entre padres e hijos y de desacuerdo entre distintos miembros del clan familiar configurando un ambiente propicio para la aparicion de nuevos problemas de indole conductual, fisiologica o emocional.Chambless y Ollendick (5) recogen los tratamientos psicologicos empiricamente validados establecidos por los grupos de trabajo de la Task Force de la APA. Den-tro de los problemas pediatricos, y mas concretamente de los alimentarios, Kerwin (6) establece que el unico tratamiento empiricamente validado para los trastornos severos de alimentacion es la terapia de conducta.",

Method A representative UK sample (non-institutionalised, &gt; 14 years old) was interviewed by telephone ( n =4972; 79.6% participation rate) with the Sleep-EVAL system. Subjects fell into three groups according to presence of insomnia symptom (s) and/or sleep dissatisfaction. Results Insomnia symptoms occurred in 36.2% of subjects. Most of these (75.9%), however, reported no sleep dissatisfaction. In comparison, those also with sleep dissatisfaction had higher prevalence of sleep and mental disorders and longer duration of insomnia symptoms, and were more likely to take sleep-promoting medication, dread bedtime, and complain of light sleep, poor night-time sleep and daytime sleepiness. Conclusions Insomnia sufferers differ as to whether they are satisfied or dissatisfied with sleep. Although insomnia symptoms are common in the general population, sleep disturbances among sleep-dissatisfied individuals are more severe. Sleep dissatisfaction seems a better indicator of sleep pathology than insomnia symptoms.",

      "title": "Critical Issues in Dental and Medical Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnea",
      "abstract": "This critical review focuses on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its management from a dental medicine perspective. OSA is characterized by ≥10-s cessation of breathing (apnea) or reduction in airflow (hypopnea) ≥5 times per hour with a drop in oxygen and/or rise in carbon dioxide. It can be associated with sleepiness and fatigue, impaired mood and cognition, cardiometabolic complications, and risk for transportation and work accidents. Although sleep apnea is diagnosed by a sleep physician, its management is interdisciplinary. The dentist’s role includes 1) screening patients for OSA risk factors (e.g., retrognathia, high arched palate, enlarged tonsils or tongue, enlarged tori, high Mallampati score, poor sleep, supine sleep position, obesity, hypertension, morning headache or orofacial pain, bruxism); 2) referring to an appropriate health professional as indicated; and 3) providing oral appliance therapy followed by regular dental and sleep medical follow-up. In addition to the device features and provider expertise, anatomic, behavioral, demographic, and neurophysiologic characteristics can influence oral appliance effectiveness in managing OSA. Therefore, OSA treatment should be tailored to each patient individually. This review highlights some of the putative action mechanisms related to oral appliance effectiveness and proposes future research directions.",

      "title": "Insomnia treatment for adolescents: Effectiveness of group- and Internet therapy for sleep, psychopathology, cognitive functioning and societal costs",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is worldwide the most common sleep disorder among adolescents with estimates of a point prevalence ranging from 7.8% up to 23.8%. Insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, or non-restorative sleep, for at least 3 days per week, accompanied by significant daytime impairment, for at least 3 months, despite adequate opportunity to sleep. It tends to persist over time with high chronicity. Insomnia has a bidirectional relationship with psychopathology, suggesting that it can cause or exacerbate other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and even ADHD. Studies show that adolescents with disturbed sleep report more depression and anxiety, inattention and conduct problems, drug and alcohol abuse, and impaired academic performance. Furthermore, adolescents with sleep disturbances report worse perceived health, more sleepiness, energy loss, and daytime fatigue. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) is the first choice for treatments of adults, but CBTI has not been investigated in a randomized controlled trial in adolescents. Furthermore, adolescents are reluctant to seek help for psychological problems, and availability of CBTI falls short of the demand. Internet therapy has been shown to be feasible in adolescents, and therefore CBTI delivered through the Internet could fill the gap between demand and availability of insomnia treatment. In this dissertation a tailored CBTI protocol for adolescents called Slim Slapen (Sleeping Smart), was investigated for efficacy of group- and Internet therapy compared to a waiting list condition, for sleep, psychopathology, cognitive functioning, and cost-effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Alalia is a speech disorder that develops due to organic brain damage in children with normal hearing and intelligence during the first three year of life. Systemic speech underdevelopment in alalia is characterized by violations in the phonetic, phonemic, lexical, and grammatical structure. Patients with alalia can also have non-speech related impairments, including motor (impaired movement and coordination), sensory (impaired sensitivity and perception), and psychopathological disorders. There are three types of alalia: motor, sensory, and mixed. Children with motor alalia have expressive language disorders, speech praxis, poor speech fluency, impaired articulation, and other focal neurological symptoms; however, they understand speech directed to them. Patients with motor alalia are often left-handed. Regional slowing and epileptiform activity are often detected on their electroencephalogram. Children with sensory alalia are characterized by poor speech understanding (despite normal hearing) resulting in secondary underdevelopment of their own speech. These patients have problems with the analysis of sounds, including speech sounds (impaired speech gnosis), which prevents the development of association between the sound image and the object. Therefore, the child hears, but does not understand the speech directed at him/her (auditory agnosia). Differential diagnosis of alalia is challenging and may require several months of observation. It also implies the exclusion of hearing loss and mental disorders.",

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "title": "Low Iron Status: A Possible Risk Factor for First Febrile Seizure",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: SEIZURES IN CHILDHOOD: A seizure or convulsion is a paroxysmal, time-limited change in motor activity and/or\r\nbehavior that result from abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures are common in the\r\npediatric age group and occur in approximately 10% of children. Most seizures in children are\r\nprovoked by somatic disorders originating outside the brain, such as high fever, infection,\r\nsyncope, head-trauma, hypoxia, toxins, or cardiac arrhythmias. Other events, such as breathholding\r\nspells and gastro esophageal reflux, can cause events that simulate seizures. A few\r\nchildren also exhibit psychogenic seizures of psychiatric origin. Less than one third of seizures\r\nin children are caused by epilepsy, a condition in which seizures are triggered recurrently from\r\nwithin the brain.\r\nFor epidemiological classification purposes, epilepsy is considered to be present when\r\ntwo or more unprovoked seizures occur at an interval greater than 24 hr apart. The cumulative\r\nlifetime incidence of epilepsy is 3% and more than half of cases begin in childhood. However,\r\nthe annual prevalence of epilepsy is lower (10.5—0.8%) because many children outgrow\r\nepilepsy.\r\nAlthough the outlook for most children with symptomatic seizures or those associated\r\nwith epilepsy is generally good, the seizures may signal a potentially serious underlying\r\nsystemic or central nervous system (CNS) disorder that requires thorough investigation and\r\nmanagement. For children with epilepsy, the prognosis is generally good, but 10—20% have persistent seizures refractory to drugs, and those cases pose a diagnostic and management\r\nchallenge.\r\nSeizures have been recognized since ancient times and although improvement has been\r\nmade in management over this century compared to the previous 2000 years, there are still far\r\ntoo many children whose lives are crippled by poorly controlled seizures. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the association between iron deficiency and the first febrile seizure. DISCUSSION: In our study to detect low iron status as a possible risk factor for first febrile seizures 63\r\ncases and 63 age and sex matched controls are studied and analyzed .\r\nIn the present study we found that the peak incidence of febrile seizure occur during one to\r\ntwo years of age and the mean age is 18 months. This is comparable to previous studies. The\r\npeak age of onset being 14-18 months of age as per Nelson textbook of pediatrics (22). Berg et\r\nal. in his study found that the peak incidence is between 18 and 24 months (12). Similarly\r\nNaveedur Rehman et al. reported the peak incidence at 22 Months (18).\r\nThe present study depicts that the incidence of febrile seizures is slightly higher in boys\r\nthan in girls and the male: female ratio 1.4: 1. This is similar to the study by Berg et al (12).\r\nwhile Naveedur Rehman et al. reported no gender difference in their study (18).\r\nIn our study family history of febrile seizures is seen only in 28.5% of cases. But Forfar\r\ntextbook of pediatrics mentions that 50% will have a family history of convulsions and\r\n80% of monozygotic twins are concordant for febrile convulsions (23).\r\nThe mean serum ferritin level in our study is 14.5ng/ml. whereas Daoud As et al. in his\r\nstudy group from Jordan found that the mean ferritin level was 29.5ng/ml (17). It is\r\nprobably due to the fact that iron deficiency anemia is more prevalent in our country; the\r\nmean serum ferritin level of Indian children is also low when compared to the Western\r\nstandards. CONCLUSION: Plasma ferritin level and blood indices are significantly lower in children with febrile\r\nseizures as compared to children without febrile seizures suggesting that iron deficient children\r\nare more prone to febrile seizures. A follow-up study of patients found to be iron deficient at\r\nthe time of a first febrile seizure to determine the incidence of subsequent febrile seizures after\r\ntreatment for iron deficiency would be of great interest.\r\n· Daoud As et al. in his study found that a significant proportion of children with febrile\r\nseizures had only low serum ferritin level (17). The proportion of children with febrile\r\nseizures having low hemoglobin, Mean Corpuscular Volume and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin were not statistically significant. Whereas our study demonstrates a\r\nstatistically significant difference in the proportion of children with febrile seizures have not\r\nonly low serum ferritin but also low hemoglobin and low Mean Corpuscular Volume. This\r\nis similar to the findings reported by Naveedur Rehman et al. in his study at Karachi (18).\r\nThis is probably due to the fact that iron deficiency occurs in three stages.\r\n(a) First stage characterized by decreased storage of iron without any other detectable\r\nabnormalities.\r\n(b) An intermediate stage of `latent iron deficiency` i.e. iron stores are exhausted, but\r\nanemia has not occurred yet.\r\n(c) The third stage is that of overt iron deficiency when there is a decrease in the\r\nconcentration of circulating hemoglobin due to impaired hemoglobin synthesis.\r\nThe children in Western countries if they are iron deficient are mostly in the early stage.\r\nSo the study done by Daoud AS et al. in Jordan has a significant proportion of children with\r\nlow ferritin level, without significant difference in HB, MCV and MCH. Whereas Indian\r\nchildren/children of our neighboring country Pakistan are in the stages of latent or overt iron\r\ndeficiency. So our study and the study done in Karachi by Naveedur Rehman et al. had a\r\nsignificantly greater proportion of children with not only low serum ferritin but also low HB\r\nand MCV.",

      "abstract": "inal symptoms at the same intensity as before treatment, entailing a return of the same episode and a new episode of illness, respectively [6, 9] . When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] .

Not all patients have all symptoms. When cataplexy is present, the disorder is almost always due to a destruction by the immune system of about 70,000 brain cells that produce a chemical called hypocretin. As this chemical helps in staying awake and regulating sleep and muscle tone, the lack of hypocretin explains all the symptoms of narcolepsy. In these cases of narcolepsy, the disease is life-long and does not resolve. When cataplexy is not present, many causes may be involved and the diagnosis is more difficult. Evolution and response to treatment are also more variable. Narcolepsy is diagnosed using sleep tests, biochemical measures and occasionally by measuring hypocretin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after a lumbar puncture. Current treatments involve medication and behavioral, life styles changes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Complaints about sleep are common in elderly adults. While changes in sleep architecture occur with normal aging, complaints about sleep are often related to pathological and treatable sleep disturbances. Primary sleep disturbances occurring in older adults include circadian rhythm disturbances, insomnia, sleep disordered breathing, rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and periodic limb movements in sleep. Particularly in older adults, sleep disturbances are likely to represent a multifactorial syndrome in which medical illness, psychiatric illness, and medications play a role. Sleep complaints necessitate the attention of the clinician as they are associated with poor outcomes. Because treatment strategies differ depending on the etiology of the sleep disturbance, a careful and systematic approach to diagnosis is crucial. This chapter reviews the normal changes in sleep that occur with age and sleep disorders frequently seen in older adults including in those with major neurocognitive disorders/dementia. Diagnosis and treatment strategies are discussed.",

Such disturbances of sleep could be characterized by a dissociation of the daily sleep volume into some epoches which lasted not more than 5-6 hours each. The EEG, submental EMG and heart rate as well as respiration were recorded continuously during the sleep periods. Eye movements, however, as they are not detectable by electric recording, were observed visually. In our 4 cases of blind children eye movements disappeared during sleep and sleep stages characterized by desynchronized EEG were found to be reduced.

While the prevalence of sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome has a pronounced increase across the lifespan (1-3), the prevalence of psychiatric conditions such as mood and anxiety disorders remains somewhat constant frommiddle to old age (4). Sleep disturbance is a symptom criterion across a number of psychiatric illnesses, including many of the mood and anxiety disorders as delineated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th revision (DSM) (5). Most commonly, the sleep disturbance is in the form of an insomnia complaint and to a lesser extent it relates to hypersomnia and other common disorders of sleep such as sleep apnea. Alterations in sleep architecture are evidenced across a variety of mood and anxiety disorders when sleep is subjected to polysomnographic evaluation. It is also the case that a host of psychotropic medications either alter sleep architecture and/or contribute to subjective sleep complaints.",

Insomnia (hyperarousal), parasomnias (partial arousal) and the sudden death syndrome of infancy are all attributed to disorders of arousal. It is concluded that diurnal hyperarousal leads to difficulty in getting off to sleep and staying asleep, whilst nocturnal arousal leads to excessive somnolence during the day, due to broken sleep during the night.",

Regular response is rare, but so is repeated non-response. Even if one or several waking therapies remain ineffective, further attempts can eventually result in marked antidepressive effects.

      "abstract": "Insomnia generally is defined a subjective report of difficulty falling sleep, difficulty staying asleep, early awakening, or nonrestorative sleep. It is one of the most common health complaints among the general population. In pathogenesis of insomnia predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors play an important role. Predisposing factors include arousal-prone personality, elevated baseline physiologic arousal, rigid circadian system, and other individual characteristics that make one vulnerable to or set the stage for the development of insomnia. Precipitating factors are the events or conditions that trigger the insomnia. Common examples include life stressors and change of sleep-wake schedule. The perpetuating factors, such conditioning of bedtime cues with arousal, maladaptive sleep-wake habits and worries over sleeplessness, then should become the focus of the treatment. Pharmacologic and non-pharmacological methods of treatment are used in the management of insomnia. In the case of the diagnosis of transient or short-term insomnia, a basic method of treatment is usually administrating the right hypnotics and information on the sleep hygiene. In chronic insomnia, a basic treatment is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which can help pharmacologically by regular use of sedative and hypnotic antidepressant medication in the evening only as needed taking hypnotics drugs (no more than 2-3 times a week).",

It is well known that insomnia is associated with increased psychological symptomatology and perceived stress, higher predisposition to arousal, and greater impairments to quality of health. The relationship between dizziness and stress is well documented, but that between dizziness and insomnia is unclear. In this series, we focus on Ménière's disease, which is characterized by fluctuating and progressive hearing loss, aural fullness, tinnitus, and intermittent attacks of vertigo, an illusory sensation of movement resulting from dysfunction of the labyrinth and cochlea, to investigate the relation between sleep disorders and dizziness. In our previous report, we first found that the sleep quality of Ménière's disease patients was impaired. Ménière's patients have a longer total sleeping time, lack of deep sleep stages, increased arousal, and the combination with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and/or periodic limb movement disorder was occasionally noted. Poor quality of sleep may cause additional stress and lead Ménière's disease patients into a negative spiral of symptoms. Furthermore, poor sleep quality may result in Ménière's disease patients being refractory to medical management. Therefore, prospective treatment focusing on the sleep disorders of, not just Ménière's disease but possibly also dizziness symptoms, may become an additional new strategy for terminating the negative spiral of symptoms and reduce exacerbation of the affected patient's conditions.",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal enuresis, defined as urinary incontinence during sleep at least twice weekly for three consecutive months in children over 5 years old, is a common childhood condition that significantly impacts both children and their families. This review examines the classification, etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment options for nocturnal enuresis. The condition is classified as either monosymptomatic or non-monosymptomatic, and primary or secondary, with primary enuresis accounting for 80% of cases. The pathophysiology involves three main mechanisms: nocturnal polyuria, high arousal threshold, and bladder dysfunction. Genetic factors play a significant role, with a strong familial component following an autosomal dominant pattern. Evaluation includes detailed medical history, voiding diary, physical examination, and basic laboratory tests. Treatment approaches are divided into non-pharmacological (including behavioral modifications, motivational therapy, and alarm therapy) and pharmacological interventions (primarily desmopressin, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticholinergic drugs). While alarm therapy shows the highest long-term success rates (65-75%), combination therapy may be necessary for treatment-resistant cases. This review emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment approaches and family support in managing childhood nocturnal enuresis effectively.",

      "abstract": "Dreaming is the mental activity of REM (and less commonly NREM) sleep.It is characterised by a perception of self, inner and outer world that is distinct from that of wakefulness.Neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies suggest that dreaming arises from activation of brainstem, thalamo-limbic and medial temporo-occipital areas and inactivation of dorsolateral prefrontal areas.Dream abnormalities in neurological disorders have poorly been studied.They include a reduction/cessation of dreaming (Charcot-Wilbrand syndrome), an increase in dream frequency, changes in dream contents and accompaniments (including REM sleep behaviour disorder) and the occurrence of dream-like experiences (hallucinations) during wakefulness and wake-sleep/sleep-wake transitions.Dream changes in association with neurological conditions including primary sleep disorders (e.g.narcolepsy, REM sleep behaviour disorder [RBD], nightmares), stroke and Parkinson's syndrome are reviewed.Assessment of altered dreaming and dreamlike experiences can be of clinical significance because of their diagnostic and therapeutic implications (RBD, hallucinations), prognostic significance (hallucinations) and distress that they can have for patients and their bed partners (e.g.nightmares, hallucinations, RBD).In addition, systematic studies of dream and dream-like experiences are expected to offer unique insights into the brain, mind and emotions of neurological patients.",

Apart from factors not specifically related to pulmonary diseases (e.g. consequences of infections or malignant diseases of the lungs), increased work of breathing due to impaired lung/thoracic cage mechanics, the effects of chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia, the consequences of disturbed sleep and psychosocial factors are mainly responsible for the impaired physical fitness and the fatigue in association with lung diseases. A careful case history including psychosocial aspects and a thorough physical examination are essential for an efficient diagnostic evaluation. Tests of pulmonary function not only in the awake patient at rest, but also during sleep or adequate physical exercise can reveal the causes of impaired physical performance and fatigue related to lung diseases.",

We present three female adolescents who developed an acute psychosis a few days before menstruation, which resolved completely upon bleeding or several days later, only to reappear in the same form in subsequent cycles. The clinical presentation was not in line with that of the typical functional psychoses. An extensive medical work-up did not show any significant disturbances, with the exception of anovulatory cycles in one youngster. Psychotropic treatment had no effect on the course of the psychosis. Treatment with progesterone in the second half of the cycle in one case, and with a combined progesterone/estrogen contraceptive agent in another, resulted in full recovery within several cycles. The third girl showed a spontaneous remission within four cycles. Remission continued in all cases after discontinuation of the hormonal treatment, and with no need to reintroduce any psychotropic agent, for a period of 2-4 years. We discuss several possible etiologic mechanisms for cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle, including it being a cycloid non-specific affective disorder, and its association with a temporary functional hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and with anovulation. We also discuss the role of psychotropic and hormonal treatment in this disorder.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is approximately 3% in children. Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is the most common cause of OSAS in children, and obesity, hypotonic neuromuscular diseases, and craniofacial anomalies are other major risk factors. Snoring is the most common presenting complaint in children with OSAS, but the clinical presentation varies according to age. Agitated sleep with frequent postural changes, excessive sweating, or abnormal sleep positions such as hyperextension of neck or abnormal prone position may suggest a sleep-disordered breathing. Night terror, sleepwalking, and enuresis are frequently associated, during slow-wave sleep, with sleep-disordered breathing. Excessive daytime sleepiness becomes apparent in older children, whereas hyperactivity or inattention is usually predominant in younger children. Morning headache and poor appetite may also be present. As the cortical arousal threshold is higher in children, arousals are not easily developed and their sleep architectures are usually more conserved than those of adults. Untreated OSAS in children may result in various problems such as cognitive deficits, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, poor academic achievement, and emotional instability. Mild pulmonary hypertension is not uncommon. Rarely, cardiovascular complications such as cor pulmonale, heart failure, and systemic hypertension may develop in untreated cases. Failure to thrive and delayed development are serious problems in younger children with OSAS. Diagnosis of pediatric OSAS should be based on snoring, relevant history of sleep disruption, findings of any narrow or collapsible portions of upper airway, and confirmed by polysomnography. Early diagnosis of pediatric OSAS is critical to prevent complications with appropriate interventions. Key words: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, Child, Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Sequelae",

      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 3rd edition, ICSD-3, it has been defined as chronic (lasting more than three months) or short-term insomnia (less than three months).In clinical practice, the usual therapeutic approach is pharmacological (benzodiazepines, z drugs, slow wave sleep enhancers), even if the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), the American College of Physicians (ACP), and the European Sleep Research Society (ESRS) guidelines suggest that the first clinical choice should be non-pharmacological (cognitive behavioral therapy).

      "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea, polysomnography, and split-night studies: consensus statement of the Connecticut Thoracic Society and the Connecticut Neurological Society.",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea is a state-dependent syndrome. It is characterized by repeated collapse of the upper airway as the result of the loss of waking neuromuscular drive as the brain changes from wakefulness to sleep. This produces a state-dependent decrease in muscle tone, which, together with other predisposing factors such as obesity and anatomical narrowing of the upper airway, results in the spectrum of sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing describes the continuum from simple snoring (pharyngeal vibration), to flow limitation (hypopnea), to complete cessation of breathing (apnea). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the common description of what is now appreciated as the sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. The cardinal symptoms are snoring, observed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The immediate physical consequences are hypoxia, repeated sympathetic discharges, increased cardiac load, and repeated brain arousals. The repetitive arousals are required to restore airway patency, resulting in severely fragmented sleep and consequent sleep deprivation. The syndrome, untreated, produces significant cognitive and cardiorespiratory morbidity, and potential mortality. Compared to matched controls, patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea use twice the health resources and spend double the health-care dollars in the 10 years prior to diagnosis. Both trends are reversed by successful treatment. It is by definition a sleep-related illness and can be observed and evaluated only when the patient is asleep. Polysomnography is the laboratory procedure to study sleep and its protean dysfunctions. Multiple physiologic parameters are required to document the various types of sleep disorders as well as to establish the origin of pathologic sleep fragmentation. Complete polysomnography includes (but is not limited to) electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram ((EOG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory effort, air flow, and oxygen saturation. Treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, uvulopalatal and/or maxillomandibular surgery, positional control, and weight loss. The efficacy of each depends on the individual anatomy and the severity of the sleep-disordered breathing. CPAP is accepted as the most reliable treatment regardless of anatomy and severity. It is currently the only treatment modality which can be titrated during sleep and requires simultaneous polysomnography.",

The authors submit two case-histories of middle aged women (30 and 37 years old) without disturbances of the day-time eating behaviour, without obvious psychopathology where the symptomatology of NES developed slowly from the age of 14 and 25 years resp. Both patients ate at night small amounts of easily consumed foods which they went to fetch in the kitchen as often as five times per night. Their behaviour was calm and aimed. Usually they did not remember the nocturnal eating. Polysomnographic examination in both patients revealed poor sleep with frequent changes of the sleep stages, with frequent awakenings, in both patients incl. even awakening from deep NREM sleep.

      "abstract": "Diversos factores como el incremento en la demanda de productos y servicios durante las 24 horas del dia, ha fomentado la sobre exigencia fisica, haciendo que los horarios laborales aumenten, generando nuevos problemas y necesidades a resolver. Tal es el caso de la aparicion de periodos de somnolencia durante las jornadas laborales, lo cual se ha convertido en una causa importante de accidentes automovilisticos, industriales y medicos. La somnolencia es causada por el ritmo circadiano y la privacion del sueno, es un estado fisiologico donde el tiempo de respuesta es mas lento que los niveles normales, los principales sintomas de somnolencia son la falta de capacidad de concentracion, atencion, vigilancia y dificultades para mantenerse despierto (Abbood, et al., 2014). En esta tesis se presenta el desarrollo de un sistema de asistencia no intrusivo para la deteccion de somnolencia en tiempo real, que alerta al usuario si es necesario, con el objetivo de reducir el numero de accidentes causados por somnolencia. El dispositivo desarrollado esta basado en el monitoreo de ritmo cardiaco debido a que el sistema nervioso autonomo afecta el latido del corazon de una persona con somnolencia (Bader, 2002). En este proyecto se realizaron estudios aplicando la metodologia seis sigma para el desarrollo de productos, basandose en una muestra de 20 usuarios, monitoreando su ritmo cardiaco a lo largo de sus actividades diarias para determinar sus rangos de vigilia y sueno, posteriormente se realizaron pruebas con un simulador de manejo activando un sistema de asistencia cuando su estado de alerta disminuia drasticamente. Como sistema de asistencia se incorporo una alarma sonora para recuperar el estado de alerta del usuario, debido a los efectos del sonido en las primeras etapas del sueno. Se identificaron variaciones importantes en el ritmo cardiaco que pueden ser utilizadas para la estandarizacion del monitoreo de somnolencia, manteniendo la medicion del estado de alerta, sin importar los rangos de ritmo cardiaco de cada persona.",

      "title": "Insomnia in Older Adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder in older adults is associated with dissatisfaction with quality or quantity of sleep and is also associated with difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or early morning awakening. It is frequently associated with an age-related decrease in restorative stage 3 of nonrapid eye movement sleep as well as advance phase shift leading to early morning awakening. Sleep disturbances in older adults, as in younger patients, have a bidirectional relationship with many medical and psychiatric disorders as well as polypharmacy. The health consequences of insomnia in the elderly may also include manifestation or magnification of cognitive deficits. Diagnosis of insomnia is based on history from the patient, the bed partner, self-administered questionnaire or sleep diary, comprehensive evaluation for comorbid medical/psychiatric disorders, and comprehensive medication history. Both nonpharmacological and pharmacological strategies are effective in the management of insomnia. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) should be considered as an initial intervention for chronic insomnia. Pharmacological treatment with short-acting hypnotics is a valuable adjunct to CBT-I for acute insomnia for a brief period followed by a slow taper. Any treatment intervention should be in collaboration with the patient and/or family and include a discussion of the risks, benefits, and costs. [ Psychiatr Ann. 2018;48(6):279–286.]",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a multifactorial etiology, but it is primarily suggested to be due to a loss of dopaminergic function, which produces multiple neurological and psychiatric symptoms, including motor, cognitive, and emotional dysfunction. Additionally, most patients with PD experience sleep-related symptoms, including difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and parasomnias such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (Kumar et al. 2002; Brotini and Gigli 2004; Postuma et al. 2009). Most studies point out that the prevalence of sleep disturbance in PD is nearly 100% (Lees et al. 1988; Kumar et al. 2002; Poryazova and Zacchariev 2005). These sleep disorders are classified as primary sleep disorders that are intrinsic to PD and secondary sleep disorders due to either medications or motor impairment (Friedman and Chou 2004). Most studies have shown that the use of dopamine (DA) agonists cause somnolence with a reversal of the sleep–wake cycle (Ondo et al. 2001; Sanjiv et al. 2001). CONTENTS",

A reduced dream recall rate, if at all, does not appear to be the result of weakened memory capacities at that age, but may rather be due to a lower rate of current concerns. In a similar way, the changes in contents are not a function of aging per se, but have taken place already between the 20th and 45th year of age. The dreams of the dying can, because of the unusualness of the situation experienced by this group, be of a very particular nature and quality. At any age of life, the dream can become instrumental in healing processes. Dreams seem to be of vital importance in supportive psychotherapy after bereavement and, of course, during the process of dying.",

Moreover, they appear at nearly all levels of morphological organisation, ranging from the intracellular space to tissue and organs. One important feature of rhythmic behaviour is its ability to respond in a characteristic manner to different external requirements.

Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

      "title": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose of Review: The endogenous circadian rhythms are one of the cardinal processes that control sleep. They are self-sustaining biological rhythms with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours that may be entrained by external zeitgebers (German for time givers), such as light, exercise, and meal times. This article discusses the physiology of the circadian rhythms, their relationship to neurologic disease, and the presentation and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. Recent Findings: Classic examples of circadian rhythms include cortisol and melatonin secretion, body temperature, and urine volume. More recently, the impact of circadian rhythm on several neurologic disorders has been investigated, such as the timing of occurrence of epileptic seizures as well as neurobehavioral functioning in dementia. Further updates include a more in-depth understanding of the symptoms, consequences, and treatment of circadian sleep-wake disorders, which may occur because of extrinsic misalignment with clock time or because of intrinsic dysfunction of the brain. An example of extrinsic misalignment occurs with jet lag during transmeridian travel or with intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders such as advanced or delayed sleep-wake phase disorders. In advanced sleep-wake phase disorder, which is most common in elderly individuals, sleep onset and morning arousal are undesirably early, leading to impaired evening function with excessive sleepiness and sleep-maintenance insomnia with early morning awakening. By contrast, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder is characterized by an inability to initiate sleep before the early morning hours, with subsequent delayed rise time, leading to clinical symptoms of severe sleep-onset insomnia coupled with excessive daytime sleepiness in the morning hours, as patients are unable to “sleep in” to attain sufficient sleep quantity. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder is misentrainment with patches of brief sleep and wakefulness spread throughout the day, leading to unstable sleep and waking behavioral patterns and an entirely idiosyncratic sleep-wake schedule. Summary: Familiarity with these major circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder phenotypes and their overlap with other neurologic disorders is essential for the neurologist so that clinicians may intervene and improve patient functioning and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by dream enactment and complex motor behaviors during rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep atonia loss (rapid eye movement sleep without atonia) during polysomnography. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder may be idiopathic or symptomatic and in both settings is highly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegeneration, especially Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder frequently manifests years to decades prior to overt motor, cognitive, or autonomic impairments as the presenting manifestation of synucleinopathy, along with other subtler prodromal “soft” signs of hyposmia, constipation, and orthostatic hypotension. Between 35% and 91.9% of patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder at a sleep center later develop a defined neurodegenerative disease. Less is known about the long‐term prognosis of community‐dwelling younger patients, especially women, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder associated with antidepressant medications. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are frequently prone to sleep‐related injuries and should be treated to prevent injury with either melatonin 3‐12 mg or clonazepam 0.5‐2.0 mg to limit injury potential. Further evidence‐based studies about rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are greatly needed, both to enable accurate prognostic prediction of end synucleinopathy phenotypes for individual patients and to support the application of symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder as a prodromal synucleinopathy represents a defined time point at which neuroprotective therapies could potentially be applied for the prevention of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a multifaceted neurodevelopmental condition characterized by multiple psychological and physiological impairments in young children. According to the recent reports, 1 out of every 58 newly-born children is suffering from autism. The aetiology of the disorder is complex and poorly understood, hindering the adaptation of targeted and effective therapies. There are no well- established diagnostic biomarkers for autism. Hence the analysis of symptoms by the pediatricians plays a critical role in the early intervention.In the present report, we have emphasized 24 behavioral, psychological and clinical symptoms of autism.Impaired social interaction, restrictive and narrow interests, anxiety, depression; aggressive, repetitive, rigid and self-injurious behavior, lack of consistency, short attention span, fear, shyness and phobias, hypersensitivity and rapid mood alterations, high level of food and toy selectivity; inability to establish friendships or follow the instructions; fascination by round spinning objects and eating non-food materials are common psychological characteristics of autism. Speech or hearing impairments, poor cognitive function, gastrointestinal problems, weak immunity, disturbed sleep and circadian rhythms, weak motor neuromuscular interaction, lower level of serotonin and neurotransmitters, headache and body pain are common physiological symptoms.A variable qualitative and quantitative impact of this wide range of symptoms is perceived in each autistic individual, making him/her distinct, incomparable and exceptional. Selection and application of highly personalized medical and psychological therapies are therefore recommended for the management and treatment of autism.",

It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

Etiology is multifactorial : genetic, neuromuscular or urologic maturation, psychosocial stressors, toilet training, or biologic aspects. Treatment has been also multimodal : drugs to depress bladder activity, increase urethral resistance, or modulate sleep. and recently urine reduction modulation. All of these approaches reflect a lack of sufficient knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology of nocturnal enuresis. Recent researches have focused on sleep disturbances, bladder reservoir function, urine output, and a combination of the three. Sleep studies indicate that enuretic patients are normal sleepers, and enuresis can take place during any stage of sleep, but generally occurs when the bladder is filled to the equivalent of maximal daytime functional capacity. Bladder reservior capacity appears to be normal, and bladder instability is somewhat related with the pathology of nocturnal enuresis. However, enuretic patients have shown the lack of normal nocturnal increase in antidiuretic hormone levels, and nocturnal urine production increases up to 2-4 times volume of functional bladder capacity, which explains the need for bladder emptying. But behavioral approaches, especially Bell-alarm method, remain important in the treatment of primary enuresis.",

Data Sources: Revision of the relevant medical literature, research in “MEDLINE” for the period between 1976 and 2004. Textbook chapters were also consulted. Summary: The sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome is a breathing disorder during the sleep characterized by partial prolonged obstruction of the upper airway and/or intermittent complete obstruction, which interrupts the normal breathing ventilation and sleep standards. The difficulties of gas exchange occurring during sleep constitute a spectrum of diseases which varies, in increasing severity, from primary snoring to sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome with severe complications and death risk. Conclusions: During the pediatric routine clinic visit, an item of the anamnesis that should be always present is whether the child snores during the night; in case a history of snoring is found, a more detailed anamnesis, mainly with regard to the existence of signs and/or symptoms of difficult breathing, must be carried out.",

Chronotherapy (sleep deprivation, bright light therapy, and sleep phase advance) is one of the non-drug treatments of depression, which ease depression by manipulation of sleep-wake schedule or biological rhythms. There are several advantages to using sleep deprivation for treatment of depression, including early response, a high efficacy rate (approximately 60%), few side effects, and efficacy for drug-resistant depression. On the other hand, relapse is common; there is substantial burden for patients and doctors; and no medical fee is obtained. Therefore, this treatment is not widely used in Japan. However, methods for increasing and sustaining the efficacy of sleep deprivation have been reported. It is possible to increase and sustain the efficacy of sleep deprivation in combination with medication (antidepressant drug, lithium, etc.), bright light therapy and/ or sleep phase advance. Because we sometimes encounter patients who are resistant to general drug treatment, adding sleep deprivation to the treatment choices may overcome drug-resistant depression and shorten treatment duration.",

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "title": "Relationship Between Sleep Disorders and Mental Health",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders refer to a spectrum of conditions that interfere with regular sleep patterns. One of the most frequently reported clinical issues is sleep disturbance. Physiological, neurological, social, and mental well-being can be critically affected by insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Overall, health and quality of life can be impacted by sleep disorders. Mental health and sleep share a significant relationship. It has long been acknowledged that individuals with mental health disorders frequently experience sleep issues. The predominant theory has been that sleep issues are basically signs of the psychiatric disorders that they are interrelated with. The fact that sleep issues are defining characteristics of a number of psychiatric disorders and are included in the diagnostic criteria for these conditions supports this aspect. However, sleep and mental health problems are associated further in diverse ways. Emerging research evidence suggests that the relationship between mental health problems and sleep disorders is complex and includes bi-directional causation, in contrast to the long-held view of this relationship that considered sleep issues as symptoms of psychiatric disorders. An increased prevalence of mental/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among certain others, is reported among patients with insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and narcolepsy, suggesting sleep disorders as a risk factor for mental health disorders. Although much has been established about the relationship between impaired mental health and sleep, further research is required to elaborately comprehend this relationship. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the relationship between sleep disorders and mental health.",

      "abstract": "Le sommeil est un état physiologique et comportemental caractérisé par une isolation partielle de l'environnement. Lors du sommeil, un événement perturbateur comme la douleur peut provoquer une réaction de microéveil brève et inconsciente vers un réveil comportemental caractérisé par une réactivation thalamocorticale complète et un niveau plus élevé de conscience. Le sommeil devient alors fragmenté et les plaintes de douleur se trouvent souvent exacerbées. La continuité oscillatoire de 90–110 minutes, rythme ultradien du sommeil léger et profond (non-REM: rapid eye movement) vers le sommeil paradoxal (REM), est alors rompue. Chez un patient souffrant de céphalée, on observe trois périodes durant lesquelles surviennent les crises en relation avec le sommeil: 1) dans les heures avant l'initiation du sommeil, 2) durant et, 3) après le sommeil. La céphalée de tension et la migraine, la céphalée de type hypnique, l'algie vasculaire de la face (cluster headache) et l'hémicrânie paroxystique chronique peuvent survenir en relation avec le sommeil. Soulignons que la céphalée du réveil est parfois associée à du bruxisme (serrement et grincement des dents), à un abus de médications antalgiques, à de l'hypertension, à un trouble de l'humeur ou à des réductions du flux respiratoire lors du sommeil. Les céphalées suite à un traumatisme crânien sont fréquentes et causent de l'insomnie, des réveils subits et prématurés et surtout des matins pénibles avec délai de phase circadienne. Dans le contexte d'une céphalée survenant en relation avec l'insomnie ou la somnolence diurne, la recherche de troubles respiratoires du sommeil, d'intrusions sous forme de mouvements périodiques des membres ou de bruxisme est indiquée. La polygraphie peut être effectuée en laboratoire ou en ambulatoire. La gestion de ces céphalées suit les grands principes de la médecine contemporaine tout en visant une hygiène du sommeil maximale par thérapie cognitive et comportementale, le maintien d'un rythme circadien idéal, la prise de mélatonine, la correction du phénomène respiratoire. La prise d'hypnotique ne semble pas un traitement de choix à long terme.",

      "abstract": "There are immediate and long-lasting harmful consequences to the nervous system when infants experience severe or repetitive pain. These effects are especially significant in preterm infants, who are vulnerable to neurological damage during this critical time of neurodevelopment. Painful experiences may cause structural and physiological changes within the nervous system. Repeated painful procedures may result in decreased pain thresholds and hypersensitivity to pain. Immediate harmful effects of pain include physiologic instability and increased incidence of serious complications such as intraventricular hemorrhage. Painful stressors may lead to sleep disturbances, feeding problems, and inability to self-regulate. Long-term effects of pain may include altered pain perception, chronic pain syndromes, and somatic complaints. Repetitive pain in the preterm infant may be associated with attention deficit disorders, learning disorders, and behavioral problems in later childhood. Nursing involvement with pain management is crucial to achieve positive health outcomes for high-risk infants and older children and adults who have experienced repetitive or severe pain as infants.",

The reasons for this relationship are not completely understood but may involve endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we hypothesized that insomnia symptoms would be associated with reduced endothelial function. Methods: Working adults (n = 496, 67.5% female, 78.6% white, mean age 48.7 [SD, 10.8] years, body mass index 28.2 [SD, 6.7] kg/m 2 , diabetes 5.8%, hypertension 20.0%, hyperlipidemia 17.9%, heart disease 2.6%) enrolled in the Emory-Georgia Tech Predictive Health Institute study completed baseline demographic, clinical, depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7), sleep (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), and noninvasive endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) measures. Insomnia symptoms were defined as subjective sleep latency of 30 minutes or longer, nighttime or early morning awakenings, and/or sleep medication use occurring 3 times or more per week in the past month. Results: Insomnia symptoms were reported by 39.5% of participants. Multivariable regression models showed that insomnia symptoms, age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia were inversely related to FMD. After adjusting for age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia, participants reporting insomnia symptoms had lower FMD than did participants reporting better sleep (adjusted FMD mean, 6.13% [SD, 0.28%] vs 6.83% [SD, 0.26%], P = .035). Conclusion: In this study, insomnia symptoms were associated with reduced FMD. Research examining the therapeutic benefits of treating insomnia on endothelial function and future cardiovascular risk is warranted.",

Research has shown that as many as 50% of older adults complain about difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Elderly with varieties of sleep complaints are differentially affected by 'age-related cognitive decline'. Normal developmental processes have been affected with changes in sleep, which can be further compromised by sleep disturbances secondary to medical or psychiatric diseases such as chronic pain, depression, dementia or age-related primary sleep disorders (e.g., sleep disordered breathing and periodic limb movements during sleep), or certain combinations of these high-risk factors. Sleep serves as a protective mechanism to keep the organism out of danger; therefore, it is imperative to consider sleep disorders for quality life.

Unfortunately, all too often PD patients spend their nights in misery. It may be difficult for some of them to turn or get out of bed, and many awaken frequently to urinate. Others may drool excessively, experience leg restlessness or pains, and still others are bothered frequently by disturbing nightmares. Some patients spend hours walking around or sitting in a chair, and caregivers describe episodes of nocturnal confusion.

A fact less well-recognized by clinicians and the general public is that sleep-related breathing disorders, which occur in two to ten percent of children depending on how they are defined, can have a significant impact even among children who have normal sleep duration [4]. Snoring is a hallmark symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, and enlarged tonsils are often a contributing factor to the breathing disturbance. We still do not fully understand the mechanism that links snoring or enlarged tonsils with behavioral problems and poor grades.\r\n\r\nOne of the more severe nocturnal breathing disorders, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), involves partial or complete breathing blockage recurrently during sleep, resulting in intermittent drops in blood oxygen levels and probable sleep disruption. Although brain processes are presumed to mediate the link between these medical factors and daytime behavioral and scholastic problems, our understanding of these processes remains fairly theoretical and speculative. The frontal and hippocampal regions of the brain, which are implicated in the regulation of behavior and memory, respectively, appear to be most vulnerable to OSA [4], but the evidence is indirect.\r\n\r\nIn a new study published in PLoS Medicine, Ann Halbower and colleagues [5] used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that can detect chemical metabolites linked to neural dysfunction, to shed more direct light on the neural functioning of children with OSA.",

      "title": "Reconsidering sleep perception in insomnia: from misperception to mismeasurement",
      "abstract": "Summary So‐called ‘sleep misperception’ refers to a phenomenon in which individuals have the impression of sleeping little or not at all despite normal objective measures of sleep. It is unknown whether this subjective–objective mismatch truly reflects an abnormal perception of sleep, or whether it results from the inability of standard sleep recording techniques to capture ‘wake‐like’ brain activity patterns that could account for feeling awake during sleep. Here, we systematically reviewed studies reporting sleep macro‐ and microstructural, metabolic, and mental correlates of sleep (mis)perception. Our findings suggest that most individuals tend to accurately estimate their sleep duration measured with polysomnography (PSG). In good sleepers, feeling awake during sleep is the rule at sleep onset, remains frequent in the first non‐rapid eye movement sleep cycle and almost never occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, there are patients with insomnia who consistently underestimate their sleep duration, regardless of how long they sleep. Unlike good sleepers, they continue to feel awake after the first sleep cycle and importantly, during REM sleep. Their mental activity during sleep is also more thought‐like. Initial studies based on standard PSG parameters largely failed to show consistent differences in sleep macrostructure between these patients and controls. However, recent studies assessing sleep with more refined techniques have revealed that these patients show metabolic and microstructural electroencephalography changes that likely reflect a shift towards greater cortical activation during sleep and correlate with feeling awake. We discuss the significance of these correlates and conclude with open questions and possible ways to address them.",

      "title": "Current Problems in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Insomnia",
      "abstract": "CURRENT PROBLEMS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA QUENTIN R. REGESTEIN* and PETER REICHf Recently, interest has grown in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Over 2 decades of laboratory research have yielded information that may further rationalize treatment ofdisordered sleep. Reviews have appeared discussing newer understanding and treatments for sleep problems [1, 2], and attempts are being made to forge standardized classifications for sleep disorders. Special clinics for the management of these problems are now being organized upon the notion that greater specificity in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders is at hand. Insomnia is perhaps the most common sleep disorder faced by physicians . Insomnia must be distinguished from lack of sleep. Only a tinyfraction of insomniacs is ever objectively examined for the amount of sleep actually obtained, and such examinations when done last but 1 or 2 nights. The results of the examination, when done, are not always consistent with the patient's estimation of sleep loss, yet the patient may continue to complain of insomnia in the absence of objective substantiation ofsleep loss and persist in his demands for relief. For these reasons, we define insomnia as the complaint of sleep loss. Despite the years of clinical experience in treating insomnia and the added understanding of sleep more recently accrued from research, there remain several problems that prevent agreement on how to classify insomnia. Specificity in diagnosing and treating insomnia is therefore hindered. This paper is meant to articulate these problems in order to reconcile for the practitioner the broad, prolonged clinical experience accumulated with insomnia and the relative lack of specificity for its treatment. We will attempt to describe some of the difficulties surround- *Sleep Clinic, Division of Psychiatry, Department of Medicine, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, 721 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02115; associate in medicine and assistant professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School. tPhysician, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital; and associate professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School.© 1978 by The University of Chicago. 0031-5982/78/2102-0006S01.00 232 I Quentin R. Regestein and Peter Reich ¦ Chronic Insomnia ing both the diagnosis and the treatment of insomnia, in order, we hope, to guide further attempts to understand and relieve insomnia patients. Diagnosis Five percent of adult patients from a general medical practice presented complained of insomnia [3], 20 percent in a similar group admitted some sort of sleep disturbance [3], and 45 percent of adults in an epidemiological survey reported difficulties in falling asleep or staying asleep [4]. This remarkable prevalence may contribute to the lack of systematic classification for insomnia. Chronic insomnia is so common that some may consider it a normal experience rather than a pathological problem [5]. Although chronic insomnia may signify severe mental or physical derangement and correlate with augmented death rates [6], much insomnia is mild and temporary. A complaint that subsides rather than persists excites little interest. Nevertheless, much insomnia remains chronic, poses great difficulty for patient and practitioner, and still remains unclassified. The frequency of psychopathology among insomniac patients provides a second reason why insomnia has not been classified. Insomnia can stem from mental problems of all kinds, and many of these are not rapidly treatable. Chronic insomniacs are said to be complaining, oversensitive people [7]. In two series ofinsomnia patients, over 85% ofthose 274 subjects tested showed pathological scores on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, an elevation in the depression scale being most common [8, 9]. Even poor sleepers, discovered through research questionnaires rather than through clinical practice, prove to be anxious, depressed, obsessively worried types [10]. Furthermore, many insomniac patients depend on drugs [H]. Chronic insomnia, therefore, associated with chronic psychological troubles and complicated by drug abuse, may be considered an unattractive problem by many physicians. In these respects it resembles alcoholism by inviting disproportionately small clinical interest. Perhaps, for this reason, characterizing insomnia has recently been left to the psychiatrists, even though prescribing for insomnia is done mostly by other physicians [12]. Certain difficulties arise whenever conditions involving much psychopathology are categorized. The rich diversity of personalities and psychological disorders are not neatly categorized. They are, furthermore , enmeshed in the unique complexity of behavioral traits that characterize every person. Psychiatric nosology, therefore...",

      "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue: Sleep in Children with Neurodevelopmental and Psychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "For those clinicians and researchers who have chosen and embraced the challenges and rewards of working on a daily basis with children and families, the concept of ‘‘developmental context’’ is hardly a revelation. As with virtually any issue that pediatric practitioners confront in clinical settings or investigators examine in experimental settings or epidemiologic studies, sleep problems in childhood must be viewed in the context of normal physical and cognitive/emotional phenomena that are occurring at different developmental stages. For example, temporary regressions in sleep development often accompany the achievement of motor and cognitive milestones in the first year of life. Similarly, an increase in nighttime fears and night wakings in toddlers may be a temporary manifestation of developmentally normal separation anxiety peaking during that stage. In addition, sleep problems in the pediatric population must be viewed against a backdrop of the normal developmental trajectory across childhood and developmental norms; i.e., ‘‘normal’’ bedtime behavior, time to sleep onset, and sleep duration are obviously dramatically different in a 6-month old, 6-year old, and 16-year old. Finally, because the developmental continuum includes the transition into adulthood, insights into the prevalence, types, and impact of, as well as risk and protective factors for, sleep problems in childhood have direct relevance in regards to an increased understanding of sleep issues at all life stages. Despite the obvious importance of viewing sleep problems in both children and adults from a developmental perspective, the body of literature in developmental aspects of pediatric sleep research at this juncture is still relatively sparse. For example, there are surprisingly little large-scale epidemiological data currently available, which systematically define normal sleep and wakefulness patterns and sleep duration in the pediatric population. Most of the existing studies have utilized subjective, parentreport, retrospective, cross-sectional surveys in selected populations. Although cross-sectional studies yield important information regarding sleep in discrete age groups, by their nature they neither describe the evolution and persistence of sleep/wake patterns over time, nor do they help to elucidate the complex reciprocal relationship between sleep and cognitive/emotional development from the prenatal period through adolescence. There are even more limited data from studies utilizing more ‘‘objective’’ methods of measuring sleep quality and duration, such as polysomnography and actigraphy; and many of these studies were conducted prior to the establishment of accepted sleep monitoring and scoring standards. There are many potential reasons for this relative knowledge gap. First, as with many behavioral issues in childhood, the patient is rarely the one who presents with a chief complaint of a sleep problem. Thus, parental concerns and subjective observations regarding their child’s sleep patterns and behaviors often define sleep disturbances in the research, as well as in the clinical context. Parental recognition and reporting of sleep problems in children also varies across childhood, with parents of infants and toddlers more likely to be aware of sleep concerns than those of school-aged children and adolescents (and to report them to clinicians and researchers). Furthermore, the very definition of what behaviors constitute a sleep ‘‘problem’’ is often highly subjective and is frequently determined by the amount of disruption caused to parents’ sleep. Culturally based values and beliefs regarding the meaning, importance, and role of sleep in daily life, as well as culturally based differences in sleep practices (e.g., sleeping space and environment, solitary sleep vs. co-sleeping, use of transitional objects) also have a profound effect on how a parent",

      "abstract": "Presently, a lot of data indicate that the disturbance of mechanisms underlying the regulation of sleep-waking cycle coincides with the mechanisms underlying the development of depression. The disturbance of circadian rhythms is one of the core factors in the genesis of the most affective disorders including depression, which indicates the role of the internal biological clock in the pathophysiology of affective disorders. The episodes of depression, mania or hypomania may result from the disturbances in endogenous biological timing. In this review, we have summarized the literature data obtained in animal models or in the patients with affective pathology, in which the connection between the function of sleep and depression was demonstrated. Specifically, we highlight the mechanisms underlying sleep dysfunction during depression (imbalance of circadian rhythms, melatonin metabolism and mechanisms of neuroinflammatory dysregulation) and provide an evidence for the link between sleep function and depression (sleep disturbances during depressive episodes, the effects of pharmacotherapy, chronotherapy, the effect of sleep deprivation, comorbidity of obstructive sleep apnea and depression).",

      "title": "Clinical and Prognostic Implications of Cognitive Dysfunction and Depression in COPD",
      "abstract": "In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cognitive dysfunction - mainly of secondary memory, executive, and constructional abilities - is a marker of disease severity with important clinical and prognostic implications. It correlates with poor compliance with pharmacological therapy, and poor compliance, in turn, increases the cost/effectiveness ratio of home care programs. Executive dysfunction is associated with difficulty with inhaler devices and should be systematically evaluated before prescribing. Drawing impairment has been associated with mortality, although the underlying neurologic abnormalities (right insular damage with autonomic dysfunction or subcortical damage) remain to be defined. Depression is also negatively correlated with survival, besides being a risk factor for quitting respiratory rehabilitation. Cognitive dysfunction should always be considered among the systemic effects of COPD and be the object of systematic screening in COPD patients. Identifying cognitive impairment would prompt either interventions promoting the adherence to the therapy or further investigations to exclude respiratory (nocturnal or effort hypoxemia, coexistent obstructive sleep apnoea) or non respiratory (decompensated diabetes, hypoglycaemic crises, poorly controlled hypertension etc.) causes of cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive enhancing strategies deserve consideration in the framework of a comprehensive approach aimed at improving the health status of people with COPD.

      "title": "Clinical Neuropharmacology of Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Within the context of the comprehensive treatment of sleep disorders, which includes medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and social interventions, use of medication is often indicated. Among the three benzodiazepine hypnotics that are available in the United States for the treatment of insomnia, flurazepam is effective for both sleep induction and maintenance, and it retains most of its efficacy over a 4-week period of nightly administration; temazepam is effective only for sleep maintenance, and triazolam improves both sleep induction and maintenance with initial but not with continued administration. Rebound phenomena are more frequent and intense with the more rapidly eliminated drug, triazolam, and to a lesser degree with temazepam. Also, with triazolam, certain behavioral side effects, such as amnesia and psychotic-like symptoms, have been reported. With flurazepam, which is a slowly eliminated benzodiazepine, daytime sedation is more frequent than with the other two drugs. When insomnia is secondary to major depression, antidepressant medication should be administered. Methylphenidate, amphetamines, or other stimulant medications are used for the symptomatic treatment of the sleepiness and sleep attacks of narcolepsy and hypersomnia. For cataplexy and the other two auxiliary symptoms of narcolepsy, imipramine or other tricyclics are the drugs of choice. Protriptyline and medroxyprogesterone have been used in treating mild cases of obstructive sleep apnea, but their efficacy is limited. Similarly, for the treatment of central sleep apnea, medroxyprogesterone and acetazolamide have shown only limited effects. Medication for patients with sleepwalking, night terrors, or nightmares should be prescribed judiciously, and primarily when treatment of an underlying psychiatric condition is desired. The neuropharmacology of sleep should also consider drugs that may cause sleep disorders. Medications with sleep disturbing effects include various antihypertensives, bronchodilators, and the energizing antidepressants. Withdrawal of REM-suppressant drugs, such as the barbiturates, may cause nightmares in association with a REM rebound. Occasionally, a drug or a combination of drugs may produce somnambulistic-like activity in some patients.",

There was no childhood or family history of parasomnia. The events had gradually become more frequent over the years, occurring in the first half of the night within 2 h of sleep onset. There were no triggers, and she had partial amnesia for the events. A diagnosis of adult-onset sleep terrors was made on clinical grounds and supported polysomnographically. Seizures and periodic limb movements were excluded as triggering factors. There was some mild sleep disordered breathing (predominantly non-desaturating hypopnea with a propensity for REM sleep of debatable significance). Imaging of the brain and spine and neurophysiological investigations ruled out lesions, entrapments, or neuropathies as possible causes of pain. Treatment (clonazepam, paroxetine, or gabapentin) was poorly tolerated and made no difference to the nocturnal episodes, while trazodone worsened them. This is the first report of hypnopompic psychic pain in association with a NREM parasomnia. We hypothesize that the pain may represent a sensory hallucination analogous to the more commonly recognized visual NREM parasomnia-associated hypnopompic visual hallucinations and that, as such, it may arise during arousal of the sensory neocortex as confabulatory response.",

The optimum strategy for reducing sleepiness in connection with irregular work hours would be to simple avoid night and early morning work and to ensure proper time for sleep between work periods. Still, if irregular work hours cannot be avoided, fatigue may be reduced through strategic sleeping (including naps), coffee intake, and phase adjustment through light or melatonin (not properly evaluated yet, though). As a complement, alertness may be protected through increasing the level of stimulation in the work situation. This may be accomplished through changing work tasks, controlled noise, light physical activity or interaction with work mates. To some extent also cold air, fresh air, and bright light may be effective. However, it should be emphasized that increased stimulation is effective only for as long as the stimulation is applied.

      "title": "0855 A challenging case of nocturnal visual hallucinations in an elderly woman",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Nocturnal hallucinations can be part of a wide array of different disorders, like sleep disorders (e.g. narcolepsy), visual impairment (e.g. Charles-Bonnet syndrome), neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Lewy Body Dementia) and psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia). We explore the differential diagnosis, the challenging diagnostic workup and the limited therapeutic options in this patient with complex visual nocturnal hallucinations. Report of Cases: A 64 year old woman was referred with detailed and vivid visual nocturnal hallucinations (seeing her dog smoking a cigar, seeing someone in the room moving her bed, etc.). The hallucinations started 1-2 months ago, were mainly present at night (both when falling asleep and during the night) but occasionally also during the day. She had also been suffering from worsening daytime sleepiness for 3-4 months, and from memory problems for 1 year. Cataplexy and sleep paralysis were absent. Clinical neurological examination was normal. The patient had been diagnosed in the past with OSAS. She had been treated with CPAP for 3 years and recent polysomnography showed good control of her apnea. She had also been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, COPD and cardiomyopathy. Because of her age, the vivid hallucinations, and the memory problems, we first wanted to rule out Lewy Body Dementia. Neuropsychological testing ruled out dementia. MRI of the brain showed some white matter lesions, without substantial atrophy. At a subsequent multidisciplinary consultation, her cardiologist considered her cardiomyopathy as a contraindication for stimulants. Therefore, and because we believed the a priori probability for narcolepsy to be low, an additional MSLT was not considered useful. Based on further pulmonary tests, we hypothesized that hypoxia could play a role in the hallucinations and hypersomnolence. The hallucinations improved over time, the hypersomnolence remained, but we found there were no good treatment options available, considering the cardiac contraindications for stimulants. Conclusion There is a wide-ranging differential diagnosis for nocturnal visual hallucinations. The specific patient characteristics are important both for further diagnosis and treatment options.

Sleepwalking and sleep terrors have been defined as disorders of arousal that occur early in the night and have their onset during stage 3 or 4 sleep. In both disorders, patients are difficult to arouse, and complete amnesia or minimal recall of the episode is frequent. Genetic, developmental, and psychological factors have been identified as causes of both sleepwalking and sleep terrors. Sleepwalking and sleep terrors typically begin in childhood or early adolescence and are usually outgrown by the end of adolescence.? When sleepwalking or sleep terrors have a post-pubertal onset or continue to adulthood, psychopathology is a more significant causative factors. The behavior that occur from deep slow-wave sleep can be painful or dangerous to the individual and/or disturbing to those close to that individual. The assessment of patients suspected of having these conditions requires a thorough medical and sleep history.

      "abstract": "Disasters, whether resulting from terrorism or natural events, have a dramatic impact on the health and well-being of children. Studies after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York City and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and countless reports on the impact of natural disasters on children show that a child's mental health can suffer from direct and indirect exposure to these events. Children may react to a disaster or act of terrorism in a variety of ways. These reactions are influenced by age, developmental level, intellectual capacity, individual and family support systems, personality, and other factors. Common manifestations of psychological trauma in young children include regression, clinging behavior, inattentiveness, aggressiveness, bed-wetting, somatic complaints, irritability, social withdrawal, nightmares, and crying. Longer-lasting effects may include depression, anxiety, adjustment disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and interpersonal or academic difficulties. Some children are particularly vulnerable to postdisaster trauma because of preexisting psychosocial stressors (homelessness, foster care, exposure to violence, etc), low socioeconomic status, or special needs (including cognitive delays and prior mental illness). These postdisaster reactions may not manifest until well after the event and could persist for years.\n\nThe National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP) at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health gathered key staff to discuss the appropriate response to the needs in the Gulf Coast region. Over the following few days, talks were held with federal, state, and local public officials to assess immediate needs and determine what resources could be offered to the affected areas. Necessary clearances to provide medical care were obtained from the Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas departments of health. Permission was also necessary (and obtained) for access to gasoline and necessary supplies including pharmaceuticals and to travel after curfew.\n\nThe Children's Health Fund and the NCDP launched Operation Assist, a collaborative effort to organize programs … \n\nAddress correspondence to Paula A.

      "abstract": "Headache can affect all aspects of a child's functioning, leading to negative affective states (eg, anxiety, depression, anger) and increased psychosocial problems (for instance, school absences, problematic social interactions). For children and adolescents who experience frequent headache problems, comorbid psychological issues are a well‐recognized, but poorly understood, clinical phenomenon. The confusion surrounding the relationship between pediatric headache and psychopathology exists for several reasons. First, in some cases, headache has been inappropriately attributed to psychological or personality features based on anecdotal observations or interpretations that go beyond the available data. Additionally, measures of psychopathology have not always adhered to the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic criteria, thus reducing the reliability of diagnostic judgments. Furthermore, the diagnosis of headache has not always followed standard criteria, and has been complicated by the emergence of new terms and evolving measures. Finally, methodological shortcomings, such as incomplete descriptions of the procedures and criteria used for the study, inadequate descriptions of headache severity, lack of a control group for comparison with individuals without headaches, reliance primarily on cross‐sectional research designs that are often discussed with inferences to causal hypotheses, and the use of unstandardized assessment measures, have significantly limited the validity of research findings. The goal of the current review is to examine the extant literature to provide the most up‐to‐date picture on what the research has made available about the magnitude, specificity, and causes of psychopathology in children and adolescents with headache, in an effort to further elucidate their relationship and prompt a more methodologically rigorous study of these issues.",

      "title": "ANÁLISIS DEL LLANTO EN NIÑOS HIPOACÚSICOS Y NORMOYENTES DE 0 A 2 AÑOS DE EDAD",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Infant crying is a complex phenomenon that implies several functions: breathing, action of laryngeal and supra-laryngeal muscles under the control of the neurovegetative systems of the brainstem, and the limbic system, and the association of cortical areas and the cerebellum. Although it is a communication system different to babbling and language, it is related with the future development of phonation. Cry analysis provides information about the neurophysiologic and psychological states of newborns and the identification of perinatal abnormalities. It is necessary to discuss the subject extensively because there are new data on situations such as laringomalacia, congenital hypothyroidism, deafness and sleep apnea that seem to be associated to infantile crying behaviors. Infant cries can be analyzed as behavioral conditions (hunger, anger and pain cries) allows knowing of mother-child relationship or the effect under diverse cultural conditions, such as stress, emotional deprivation or illness. A spectrographic analysis of the cries may identify several characteristics: threshold, latency, duration of phonation, maximum and minimum of the fundamental frequency (F0), occurrence and maximum pitch of shift, gliding, melody, biphonation, bifurcation, noise concentration, quality of the voice, double harmonic break, glottal plosives, vibratos, melody types, F0 stability and inspiratory stridor. To date, it has not been possible to establish alteration patterns. The best studied variables are F0, its harmonics and the duration of each emission; it is accepted that F0 varies between 400 and 600 Hz, during 1.4 ± 0.6 s. Under such approaches, diverse alterations and risk factors have been studied: congenital alterations, malnutrition, sudden death, maternal exposition to drugs, prematurely born babies or perinatal asphyxia and disturbances of the central nervous system. Authors have reported F0 equal or less than 300 Hz in cases of sudden death or with high frequencies, near the 1000 Hz in the Cri du chat syndrome, perinatal asphyxia and other cases who died suddenly. During the cry, there is an increase of intra-abdominal pressure, heart rate and blood pressure, reduction of oxygen saturation, increase of the intra cranial-pressure, beginning of stress reactions, depletion of the energy anf oxygen reserves, such as the found in the Valsalva’s maneuver. Every event of prolonged cries implies alteration of the breathing control like a Hering-Breuer reflex. Considering that some authors have proposed early vocalizations are a good predictor of deafness, in a previous paper we reported the characteristics of the cry of 20 deaf neonates. However, we were not able to demonstrate differences when comparing them with normal hearing neonates and infants, using only parametric methods. Still, we decided to go further and investigate the quality of infant cries of deaf neonates and infants. Material and methods. Twenty zero-to two-year old cases were studied; they were deaf children of both sexes; all cases were included in a follow-up program on the Human Communication Department of the National Institute of Perinatology of Mexico and were compared with 20 normal hearing children. We recorded Brain Stem Evoked Auditory Responses (BEAR) and cry recording using a digital Sony recorder during the physical exploration. We analyzed the frequency (Hz) and duration of the espiratory cries, the duration of inspiration between two cry emissions and the characteristics of the spectrogram. Quantitative analysis. The usual estimates of means and standard variation were obtained and they were compared with one way analysis of variance. We organized typologies of frequency by means of cluster techniques (Ward method). The distribution of the duration of the periods of crying and silence was explored with a contingency tables. Qualitative analysis. Two standardized observers visually analyzed all the cries to determine any variation of F0 and of harmonic frequencies. Whenever a variation of F0 was observed, we obtained maximum and minimum frequencies, as well as average duration of each cry emission. The procedure was validated by means of the graphic comparison with a Fourier’s analysis. Results. Mean duration of cries in the deaf group was 0.5845 ± 0.6150 s (range 0.08-5.2 s), while in the group of normal hearing cases was 0.5387 ± 0.2631 (range 0.06-1.75 s). From the deaf group, five cases had very prolonged duration of cries, without statistical significance. The mean duration of the inspiration was 0.3962 ± 0.2326, with a range of 0.06 to 1.75 in the deaf group and of 0.4083 ± 0.1854, with a range of 0.21 at 0.96, in the controls, without difference among groups. There was no correlation between the time of espiratory cry and that of the inspira",

      "title": "Leukodystrophy Overview – ARCHIVED CHAPTER, FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY",
      "abstract": "NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION IS ARCHIVED. IT IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. Clinical characteristics Leukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",

      "title": "Chronobiology and mood disorders",
      "abstract": "The clinical observations of diurnal variation of mood and early morning awakening in depression have been incorporated into established diagnostic systems, as has the seasonal modifier defining winter depression (seasonal affective disorder, SAD). Many circadian rhythms measured in depressive patients are abnormal: earlier in timing, diminished in amplitude, or of greater variability. Whether these disturbances are of etiological significance for the role of circadian rhythms in mood disorders, or a consequence of altered behavior can only be dissected out with stringent protocols (eg, constant routine or forced desynchrony). These protocols quantify contributions of the circadian pacemaker and a homeostatic sleep process impacting on mood, energy, appetite, and sleep. Future studies will elucidate any allelic mutations in \"circadian clock\" -related or \"sleep\"-related genes in depression. With respect to treatment, antidepressants and mood stabilizers have no consistent effect on circadian rhythmicity. The most rapid antidepressant modality known so far is nonpharmacological: total or partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night. The disadvantage of sleep deprivation, that most patients relapse after recovery sleep, can be prevented by coadministration of lithium, pindolol, serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors, bright light, or a subsequent phase-advance procedure. Phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle alone also has rapid effects on depressed mood, which lasts longer than sleep deprivation. Light is the treatment of choice for SAD and may prove to be useful for nonseasonal depression, alone or as an adjunct to medication. Chronobiological concepts emphasize the important role of zeitgebers to stabilize phase, light being the most important, but dark (and rest) periods, regularity of social schedules and meal times, and use of melatonin or its analogues should also be considered. Advances in chronobiology continue to contribute novel treatments for affective disorders.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION An estimated 20-30% of children will experience sleep problems during the first three years of life (1-4). Although parents and professionals wish that sleep problems would simply \"go away\" as the child matures, research suggests they can be highly persistent, lasting even into adulthood (5-8). Although certain pediatric sleep disorders clearly demand medical attention (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy), the majority call for clinical assessment and intervention skills that behavioral specialists are well-suited to provide. Principles of learning (e.g., reinforcement, extinction, shaping, fading, stimulus control) that have been shown successful in reducing daytime behavior problems can be highly effective in alleviating many forms of pediatric sleep disturbance (9). The purpose of this article is to review nonpharmacological interventions for pediatric sleep disturbance; namely, bedtime resistance and night waking, circadian rhythm disorders, and the parasomnias. We then review briefly a rapidly emerging literature on behavioral interventions to promote adherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for sleeprelated breathing disorders.",

      "abstract": "Neuromuscular disease (NMD) is a diverse group of hereditary or acquired conditions involving the anterior horn cells, nerves, neuromuscular junction or muscles. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in children and adults with NMD with an estimated prevalence exceeding 40%. Characteristics of NMD like progressive neuromuscular weakness of respiratory and diaphragmatic muscles, anatomic or neurologic propensity to upper airway obstruction during sleep, and/or cardiomyopathy contribute to the development of SDB. Prevalence and pattern of SDB vary with different types of NMD, depending on the features of the disease and the tempo of progression to respiratory muscle impairment. Importantly, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and nocturnal hypoventilation are often the first signs of respiratory muscle weakness in patients with NMD. The imbalance between respiratory capacity and respiratory loads usually first manifests during sleep, if not acutely during respiratory decompensation in respiratory infection. In patients with NMD, SDB typically first develops in rapid-eye-movement sleep when muscle atonia occurs, followed by continuous nocturnal hypoventilation through the night and eventually by progression into daytime respiratory failure. Untreated SDB and hypoventilation in NMD carries high respiratory morbidity and mortality. Therefore, screening for SDB and nocturnal hypoventilation is a vital part of long-term management of NMD and to detect patients at risk for respiratory failure. Anticipatory approach with regular assessment of symptoms, pulmonary function and sleep in children affected by NMD can aid early diagnosis and management of SDB. Timely provision of respiratory care and non-invasive ventilation are essential components of a multi-disciplinary care to improve quality of life and survival of patients with NMD.",

Individual differences in interoception are linked to emotional style and vulnerability to affective disorders. Here we test how experiential sleep quality relates to dimensions of interoceptive ability. 180 adults (42 'non-clinical' individuals, 138 patients accessing mental health services) rated their quality of sleep before performing tests of cardiac interoception. Poor sleep quality was associated with lower measures of interoceptive performance accuracy, and higher self-report measures of interoceptive sensibility in individuals with diagnoses of depression and/or anxiety. Additionally, poor sleep quality was associated with impaired metacognitive interoceptive awareness in patients with diagnoses of depression (alone or with anxiety). Thus, poor sleep quality, a common early expression of psychological disorder, impacts cardiac interoceptive ability and experience across diagnoses. Sleep disruption can contribute to the expression of affective psychopathology through effects on perceptual and interpretative dimensions of bodily awareness.",

Common sleep issues include chronic insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, and sleep-disordered breathing. Diagnostic tools, such as a comprehensive sleep history and questionnaires, or a sleep log for more specific complaints, are commonly used. Polysomnography is not recommended as a routine test; however, it can be used for abnormal behaviors during sleep or if treatment fails. Sleep disorder management is based on the etiology and may include nonpharmacological and pharmacological alternative treatments. For example, nonpharmacological management for chronic insomnia and some sleep disorders may consist of cognitive behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene education, relaxation therapy, sleep restriction, light therapy, and stimulus control therapy. Because the quality of evidence for pharmacological treatment is poor, the medication choice should be based on shared decision-making between the practitioner and the patient, with limited prescription.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the anxiety-related changes in the sleep macrostructure and the impact of ageing, gender and the presence of depression.1083 patients with sleep symptoms were enrolled in the study. All patients have all night polysomnographies. The effect of anxiety, depression, aging and gender on the sleep initiation, maintenance and sleep stages respectively; were analysed in 4 different statistical approaches.Anxiety increased the latency of sleep and REM sleep; and decreased the length of REM sleep and slow-wave sleep; while depressive symptoms were associated with reduced REM latency, slow-wave sleep and increased REM duration. The length of slow-wave sleep, REM phase decreased with ageing and the sleep was fragmented. Women had more slow-wave sleep and less REM sleep than men.Normal order of sleep stages is essential in the cognitive processing of the brain. Changes in sleep macrostructure may have an impact in the impairment of cognitive functions of patients suffering from anxiety or depression.",

      "abstract": "The long term development of periodic syndromes among children is little known. Our research has revealed that about one third of periodic headaches, two thirds of cyclic vomiting and half the cases of recurring abdominal pain disappear either before puberty or during adolescence. Other Authors have shown that this also happens in most cases of early-onset vertigo. The remaining headache cases develop into migraines in adults. When there is persistent cyclic vomiting, the collateral neurologic phenomena (headaches, vertigo, pallor, hypotonia, drowsiness) become more intense. This also happens in some cases of abdominal pain and paroxysmal vertigo which start in late childhood. Other sufferers from acute abdominal pain develop ulcers, gastroduodenitis and colitis as adults. Altogether, some infantile periodic syndromes (in particular the multi-symptomatic ones) have a common outcome, i.e. develop into more or less typical migraine syndromes. In these cases one can presume a common pathogenetic mechanism. In those cases where the outcome is favorable the pathogenesis may be different. These cases may often be spotted in early childhood on account of the monosymptomatic nature of the complaint or the absence of collateral neurologic symptoms as well as of the infrequency of critical episodes.",

      "title": "1183 Chasing Sleep: Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder - Free-Running Type",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, free-running type (CRSD-FRT) is a disorder caused by a circadian pacemaker that is out of sync with the 24-hour light-dark cycle. CRSD-FRT is rare in sighted persons but prevalent in totally blind individuals. In sighted people, CRSD-FRT can be associated with psychiatric conditions such as depression, but the etiology remains unknown. It is postulated that sighted persons may have reduced light sensitivity for phase-resetting effects. Symptoms of CRSD-FRT include insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and functional impairment. Here we present a unique case of CRSD-FRT in a sighted female with a history of depression. Report of case(s) A 27-year-old sighted female with history of depression previously treated with an SSRI presented to the sleep clinic with a chief complaint of chronic insomnia. Historically, she went to bed at 3 A.M. and awoke at 2 P.M. Sleep onset latency was normal. Estimated total sleep time was 10 hours. She denied history of any other sleep disorders. She experienced a similar delayed sleep routine as a teenager and assumed it was due to late-night gaming. She tried multiple sleep aids including trazodone, melatonin, and diphenhydramine, unsuccessfully. She described a “normal” sleeping schedule once per month, but then her sleep schedule began to move later and later, until it was normal again. She worked from home and was self-employed, giving her flexibility over her schedule. Her Epworth Sleepiness Score was 13 at the initial visit. Interestingly, her sibling had a similar sleeping pattern. Actigraphy was done which confirmed patient’s diagnosis of CRSD-FRT. She was advised to start Tasimelteon. Conclusion The patient was previously misdiagnosed with insomnia. CRSD-FRT is rare in sighted persons and may be underdiagnosed. Our patient’s CRSD-FRT may be linked to her history of depression and SSRI use. According to one study, a clinical dose of SSRI resulted in 47% increase in melatonin suppression, which increases the human circadian system’s responsiveness to light. Her flexible work from home schedule may also be a contributing factor. When changing or eliminating social time cues could precipitate the development of CRSD-FRT due to variations in the length of circadian rhythm. Support (if any)",

The most common sleep disorders in schizophrenia are insomnia, restless leg syndrome (RLS), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), hypersomnia, parasomnia and circadian rhythm disorders. The relevance of insomnia should be emphasized, as it can be a prodromal signof schizophrenia, as well as an alarm sign of an incipient psychotic decompensation. Additionally, the clinical recovery of a psychotic process is usually correlated with sleep normalization. Multiple polysomnographic disturbances on sleep architecture have been found in patients with schizophrenia, including increased sleep latency, awakenings during sleep, sleep-wake cycle inversion, as well as poor sleep efficiency. These objective disturbances have been correlated to subjective poor sleep quality and other main clinical symptoms in schizophrenia.",

Fatigue frequently presents early in PD, and its prevalence increases with disease progression, affecting up to 60% of patients. Fatigue has a negative impact on quality of life. Fatigue is often associated with other nonmotor symptoms, including sleep disturbance, excessive daytime sleepiness, and depression. Only a few reports have been published on the treatment of fatigue in PD (methylphenidate, levodopa, and pramipexole). Further well-designed studies, including physiotherapy, are necessary to develop more effective treatments for PD-associated fatigue. A number of patients with PD lose weight because of loss of fat. However, the evolution and determinants of weight loss are not well established. Possible determinants of weight loss in PD include loss of appetite, impaired hand-mouth coordination, difficulty in chewing and dysphagia, nausea, intestinal hypomotility, and increased energy requirements because of muscular rigidity and involuntary movements. Noticeable weight gain has repeatedly been reported after subthalamic or pallidal deep brain stimulation. Because low body weight is associated with negative health effects and a poor prognosis, monitoring weight and nutritional status should be part of PD management.",

Postpartum depression is associated with anxiety, mood swings, tiredness, feeling scared all the time, trouble sleeping or sleeping, weight loss, stress eating, losing interest, sudden weight gain, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions, fatigue and several other issues. It can happen during pregnancy as well as after giving birth. Some women experience baby blues while some experience postpartum depression. Women feel depressed and sadly most of the time. Depression can make it difficult for mother to take care of herself and the child. Various lifestyle choices also need to be mentioned while talking about factors causing PPD. Some factors affecting PPD are lack of physical activity and exercise, bad eating habits, disturbed sleep cycle etc. it may include hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, risk factors, psychological stress. One of the chief factors affecting postpartum depression is the sleep cycle. It is seen that less sleep is brought near to postnatal depression. Exercise, psychosocial support, physical stretching or working activity can decrease symptoms of depression. Exercise causes the release of mood-boosting hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, which elevates the mood. Low esteem caused by depression can be decreased by an elevated mood. Exercise can also increase endogenous endorphins and opioids which gives a positive mood. It also increases problem solving capacity and confidence. The most common management methods used for managing depression are psychological support, professional help, interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive therapy.",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

      "title": "Problems with Object Permanence: Rethinking Traditional Beliefs Associated with Poor Theory of Mind in Autism",
      "abstract": "Poor Theory of Mind (ToM) (or difficulties imputing mental states to self and others) [1], (See also [2-5]) is often blamed for certain responses and behaviour in autism. However, the Theory of Mind Task Battery requires an understanding of language, the use of cognitive skills, as well as the child’s motivation and attention to complete. All of these factors are either weak or under-developed in individuals with autism suggesting that this is not the best means to measure one’s understanding that other people have their own thoughts, plans, beliefs, or point of view. Behaviours like strong defiance, insistence on sameness, fear associated with sudden change and severe anxiety may be related to difficulties seeing beyond the ‘now’ [6]. This paper suggests that some of the stress and anxiety in the autism population may actually be due to delayed object permanence (OP) (knowing something may still exist even if it is out of sight), which can appear as poor ToM. This delay in establishing OP is governed by single focused attention. For more information on this concept see: Lawson, W. (2011) The passionate mind, JKP:London. Although ToM and OP are defined differently, this paper aims to show the relationship between them and how one concept can influence the other using examples in everyday life to illustrate how poor OP is associated with single focused attention, which detracts from the bigger picture.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbance in anxiety disorders",
      "abstract": "Many patients suffering from the majority of anxiety disorders complain about their sleep by reporting difficulties in initiating and maintaining it. Polysomnographic studies have shown that, in comparison to normal subjects, the sleep of patients with panic disorder is characterized by longer sleep latency, increased time awake and reduced sleep efficiency. Sleep architecture is normal and there are no significant changes in REM sleep measures. Nocturnal panic attacks are non-REM-related events and occur without an obvious trigger in 18-45% of panic disorder patients. Regarding generalized anxiety disorder, the patients complain of 'trouble sleeping' in 60-70%, while polysomnography has shown increased sleep latency and decreased sleep continuity measures. The findings in REM sleep and sleep architecture generally do not show any aberration to exist. In patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), results from the sleep laboratory do not seem to support the subjective complaints of poor sleep. The early reports of shortened REM latency in OCD could not be replicated by recent studies. A dysregulation of the REM sleep control system has been reported for patients with PTSD. Finally, no significant differences were found in all sleep parameters between social phobia patients and controls.",

Constipation is defined as functional constipation FC if there is no underlying organic cause, which is the case in up to 95% of children. It can be seen in healthy children one year and older and is particularly common among preschool-aged children . Most individuals have bowel movements at regular intervals, and although the frequency varies from person to person, stools should pass without significant straining or discomfort. Functional constipation is often described as difficult or infrequent bowel movements/ deviation from normal frequency, painful defecation, the passage of hard stools, and/or sensation of incomplete evacuation of stool. It is often not caused by any underlying systemic cause or anatomical defect. It is usually multifactorial to include environmental conditions, stress, diet, coping skills, and social support.",

      "title": "Seizures And Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

Other common findings are failure to thrive and feeding problems in infancy that persist into childhood, heart defects (especially patent ductus arteriosus), gastrointestinal disorders (including gastroesophageal reflux disease), and dental abnormalities. To date findings in fewer than 50 affected individuals have been reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of the 3q29 recurrent deletion is established by detection of the 1.6-Mb heterozygous deletion by chromosomal microarray at the approximate position of chr3:195998129-197623129 in the reference genome (NCBI Build 38). Management Treatment of manifestations: Early speech and language therapy to address speech delays; physical therapy as needed to address fine and gross motor delays; individualized education program (IEP) for school-age children; care by a child psychiatrist/psychologist as needed for neuropsychiatric disorders; feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube as needed; routine management of dental caries, congenital heart defects, recurrent ear infections. Surveillance: Continued assessment of feeding and nutrition, developmental milestones, cognitive development, and possible neuropsychiatric manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Parents and older and younger sibs of a proband should be tested for the 3q29 recurrent deletion to encourage close assessment/monitoring of developmental milestones (in children) and monitoring for neuropsychiatric manifestations (in children and adults). Genetic counseling The 3q29 recurrent deletion is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Although most deletions are de novo, inherited deletions have been reported. If the 3q29 recurrent deletion identified in the proband is not identified in one of the parents, the risk to sibs is low (",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

Sleep deprivation studies have been conducted for more than 45 years,1 and despite the wide range of protocols (e.g., differing environmental settings, inpatient versus outpatient studies, diagnoses, gender, age, and medications), it is effective in an estimated 40-50% of depressed patients.2 Further, the improvement in depressive symptoms (significant reductions on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, HDRS) that can occur within several hours of sleep deprivation are comparable to long-term (2-6 weeks) treatment with conventional anti - depressant medications.3 The evidence that sleep deprivation is effective even in chronic treatmentresistant patients (albeit at lower rates than non-refractory patients)4,5 may imply that it temporarily reverses some fundamental abnormality in depression. On the downside, recovery sleep (even short naps) precipitates relapse in approximately 80% of responders,2,6-9 suggesting that it also affects these same networks. Analyses of recovery sleep architecture (e.g., cumulative sleep time, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep density) fail to account for the relapse.2 Circadian factors are likely involved, as evidence suggests that recovery sleep in the morninghours is more detrimental than sleep at other times of the day in some7,9,10 but not all11 responders. A longitudinal electroencephalographic (EEG) study conducted over a period of 60 hours showed that some patients have repeated periods of microsleep (20 seconds). It was found that an accumulation of these episodes, particularly in the morning hours, is associated with a greater number of postsleep deprivation relapses.9 An ongoing challenge and a focus of current research is the identification of mechanisms to extend the rapid antidepressant responses of sleep deprivation by counteracting the apparent depressiogenic mechanisms associated with recovery sleep.",

      "abstract": "Sleep and waking habits change significantly during the adolescent years. Many adolescents do not get adequate sleep and are usually sleepy. This article explores the interplay between adolescence, sleepiness, and traffic accidents. The author considers how adolescent sleepiness is associated with a putative sleep phase delay (due to biological and psychosocial factors) and to inadequate sleep habits. Early school starting times significantly increases the sleep reduction. Likewise, weekend delays of sleep schedules alters the stability of normal sleep-wake patterns. The consequent sleep deprivation interferes with daytime functioning by provoking daytime sleepiness. This, in turn, may lead to cognitive deficits with difficulties concentrating and paying attention, to mood and behavior problems, to development of major disorders of the sleep-wake cycle, and to vulnerability to traffic accidents. During the nighttime period of increased sleepiness, young people (ages 18 to 24 years) are more vulnerable to traffic accidents. Indeed, accidents due to somnolence (sleepiness) present a peak occurrence at age 20 years.",

Frailty predicted those of fluid function (memory, processing speed and visuospatial) and crystallised ability, as measured by pronunciation of irregular words.2 Frailty was defined by the Fried phenotype, that is, the presence of at least three of: weakness (measured by grip strength); self-reported exhaustion; slow gait speed; unintentional weight loss (estimated from low body mass index) and low physical activity. In addition to age, sex and education, associations were independent of two important sources of potential confounding: a range of chronic physical conditions, suggesting that frailty is not merely marking general morbidity burden; and depressive symptoms, further suggesting that exhaustion is not a proxy for this well-known dementia risk factor. Finally, results were essentially unchanged when those scoring below the standard Mini-Mental Status Examination clinical threshold were excluded, indicating that associations with frailty operate within the framework of normal cognitive ageing.\n\nSo what is it about ‘frailty’ …",

(6) Therapeutic application of these inhibitors is based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression. Unfortunately, over half of MDD patients do not achieve remission after a 12-week treatment with SSRIs. Studies have also shown that one-third of patients treated with successive antidepressant therapies do not achieve remission even after a 1-year intervention.

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

But among those labeled neurasthenics, there is a certain proportion of patients in whom hysteria is not the factor at all; I do not here refer to psychasthenic patients, in whom anxiety and other features of psychic genesis dominate the picture; nor do I include the<i>formes frustes</i>of such psychoses as cyclothymia (manic depressive insanity), hebephrenia, etc. I refer to",

Sleeping is mandatory for the physical, emotional and mental health of children and adults. Sleep related problems are one of the most frequent reason parents ask for a pediatrician’s help. Although parents are more concerned about the child’s sleep than other processes of a child’s development, in general they do not know enough about sleep hygiene and healthy sleeping habits. Even though the prevalence of sleep disorders in children is high, it is often overlooked by healthcare professionals. From around the world we receive data how adolescents do not get enough restful sleep, leading to cognitive, social and health problems.

      "title": "El déficit cognitivo en el síndrome de fatiga crónica: factores asociados y evolución",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION: El Sindrome de Fatiga Cronica (SFC) se define como una fatiga intensa, de etiologia desconocida que dura mas de 6 meses e interfiere en la calidad de vida del paciente. Ademas de estos sintomas, se acompana de problemas de memoria y concentracion, odinofagia, adenopatia cervical o axilar dolorosa, mialgia, cefalea de inicio reciente o de caracteristicas diferentes de la habitual, poliartralgia sin signos inflamatorios, sueno no reparador y malestar postesfuerzo que dura mas de 24 horas (Fukuda et al., 1994). Alrededor del 90% de los pacientes refiere deficits cognitivos (Jason et al., 1999), siendo una de las principales causas de discapacidad funcional. Los estudios neuropsicologicos constatan algunos de estos deficits, siendo los resultados mas consistentes en velocidad de procesamiento de informacion y atencion (Cockshell y Mathias, 2010; Michiels y Cluydts, 2001). La etiologia y el alcance del deficit continua siendo desconocida. Una de las hipotesis es la que sugiere que las alteraciones cognitivas son secundarias a los trastornos emocionales habitualmente presentes en el SFC. Tambien surge la preocupacion acerca de la evolucion del deficit sobre todo por parte del enfermo, a pesar de la escasa atencion recibida por parte de la comunidad cientifica. Finalmente, se desconoce el papel de otros factores, como la propia fatiga, en la disfuncion. Teniendo en cuenta estos datos, la presente tesis presenta como objetivos: determinar el perfil de afectacion cognitiva asociado al SFC, analizar la evolucion del deficit y los factores asociados. Para ello se realizaron tres articulos.\nMETODO: Se selecciono una muestra de mujeres con SFC mayores de 18 anos. Se realizo una entrevista clinica y una evaluacion neuropsicologica. Las puntuaciones directas fueron transformadas a puntuaciones T, tomando como referencia baremos poblacionales propios que habian sido validados previamente. Se considero deficit una puntuacion T<40.\nRESULTADOS: Mas del 50% de los pacientes presentaron deficits en atencion y funcionamiento psicomotor y el 40% en velocidad de procesamiento y funciones ejecutivas. No se observaron diferencias a nivel cognitivo entre los dos grupos de pacientes con SFC con y sin depresion. Cuando los pacientes se dividieron por grupos en funcion de la duracion de la enfermedad, tampoco hubo diferencias entre ellos en terminos de funcion cognitiva. El analisis de regresion mostro que la fatiga predijo los deficits de atencion y funcionamiento ejecutivo, y los factores emocionales predijeron el rendimiento en memoria verbal.\nCONCLUSIONES: En base a estos datos, se concluyo que los pacientes con SFC presentaron deficits cognitivos principalmente en atencion, velocidad de procesamiento, funcionamiento psicomotor y ejecutivo. La depresion no explico dichos deficits cognitivos. Tampoco se observo un empeoramiento de los deficits con la duracion de la enfermedad. Finalmente, dichos deficits parecen ser explicados por mecanismos fisiopatologicos de la propia enfermedad (fatiga). Una implicacion clinica de estos resultados, podria ser la implantacion de programas de rehabilitacion cognitiva para paliar el impacto de dichos deficits en la calidad de vida de estos pacientes.",

      "title": "Non-verbal Cognitive Dysfunction in Children with Specific Language Impairment",
      "abstract": "Background: Language deficits occur in a series of developmental disorders and are widely recognized as characteristic symptoms of a range of developmental clinical conditions. In fact, Specific Language Impairment (hereafter SLI) is currently defined as a significant impairment of the child's linguistic abilities on several levels (phonology, morphology, lexical, syntax, narrative) by the presence of non-verbal IQ scores in the normal range; the diagnosis is based on a set of inclusionary and exclusionary criteria including performance at least one standard deviation below age expectations on a generic language assessment but 'normal' non-verbal intelligence. Of course, the term 'normal' non-verbal intelligence raises issues about what constitutes a 'normal' non-verbal IQ in a-/typical development and must be handled with care. However, according to the classical definition (ICD-10-GM version 2009; F80.- 'Umschriebene Entwicklungsstorungen des Sprechens und der Sprache') a child with SLI performs below age expectations on language measures despite having adequate cognitive and sensory skills for typical development with no obvious identifiable cause such as hearing loss, brain injuries or other neurological disorders.\r\nMorphology studies of individuals with developmental language disorders claim reversed asymmetry or symmetry of the planum temporale and the pars triangularis (Wernicke's and Broca's area), yet so far there is no clear evidence that children with SLI have marked anatomical differences from other children in either brain hemisphere. Moreover, some indication suggest a possible genetic link because SLI can be passed down from parents to children - although such a SLI-gene of course hasn't been identified thus far. Hence, the investigations of etiological factors are at a premature and inconclusive stage of inquiry and so far nothing but speculative causes can be mentioned.\r\nTo sum up, current literature on SLI hardly defines a language profile as 'typical' for SLI given that the spectrum of the disorder is very broad and yet unclear since in both, academic and clinical practice, the 'specific' characteristics of this developmental impairment have been questioned. After all, the fluidity of the diagnosis, making it difficult to border SLI, should actually be considered an important descriptive aspect, portraying the interactive nature of 'specific' cognitive systems. In fact, this study is motivated by the interest in the extensive issue whether there is a relationship between language impairments and impairments on general levels of nonverbal cognitive skills, as part of the broader question of the nature of language and cognition. \r\nThus, the aim of this study is to profile a child's performance across linguistic and cognitive domains, to determine if the domains are similar or discrepant in levels of performance.\r\nMethods: 30 typically developing children and 12 children with SLI between 5;0-9;0 years were tested on both their verbal and non-verbal abilities with respectively two standardized tests each. The children with SLI were all currently in therapy and classified as 'SLI' by their speech and language pathologists. All participants were from South Tyrol or Vienna and therefore German native speakers with dialectical colouring; some had a bilingual background, this fact was of course taken into consideration while analyzing the results. To 'measure' the child's non-verbal performances level the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (parallel form) and the 'Zahlensymboltest' of the HAWIK-R was used. The Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices were used to give an indication about the child's (4;9-12;00) non-verbal performance; in each test item, a candidate is asked to identify the missing segment required to complete a larger pattern. \r\nThe verbal abilities were assessed with the German version of the standardized TROG-D (original edition by D.V.M. Bishop,1989; German by Annette V. Fox, 2006) which is used to test a child's (3;0-10;11) general linguistic and grammatical comprehension. However, some items (Set 'R') were discarded since the linguistic construction is not common in the children's dialect and therefore not recognizable by them. As a second test, the first part (forward digit span) of the 'Zahlennachsprechen' of the HAWIK-R assessed the phonological loop of the short term memory, while the second part (backward digit span) not only demands phonological memorizing but also the ability to act upon the shortly memorized item. \r\nThe test battery was reduced to these four items in order to successfully conduct the experiment without losing the child's attentiveness and interest. Each test session lasted for 20-35 minutes circa, depending on the child's accomplishment. In case the child was unable to concentrate or to carry out the given tasks, the experiment was stopped up and the results gained so far were used.\r\nResults: The preliminary results show a slight tendency towards underage-expected performance of the children diagnosed with 'SLI' in non-verbal tests compared to the control group. So far, this research alludes to a range of non-verbal cognitive mechanisms interacting with language and having its implications in delineating the profile of SLI. \r\nConclusions: Many of the studies of children with language impairments who do or do not display cognitive impairments are motivated by the interest in the broader issue of the relationship between language and cognition. The extent to which the two domains of language and general cognitive abilities are inherently singular or modular remains unresolved and controversial. However, this work has shown that to a small but noticeable extent the domains of cognition and language can operate as orthogonal dimensions. According to these findings, the definition of SLI as specifically and exclusively linked to language must be revised, since the characteristics of this developmental disorder seem to be wider than first documented.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Specific Language Impairment, Cognition, Non-verbal IQ, Developmental Disorder;\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n[1]\tLeonard L.

      "title": "Advances in the Treatment of Chronic Insomnia: A Narrative Review of New Nonpharmacologic and Pharmacologic Therapies",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Chronic insomnia disorder, which affects 6– 10% of the population, is diagnostically characterized by ongoing difficulties with initiating or maintaining sleep occurring at least three times per week, persisting for at least 3 months, and associated with daytime impairment. While chronic insomnia is often considered a condition primarily related to impaired sleep, the disorder can also adversely affect domains of physical and mental health, quality of life, and daytime function, which highlights the importance of treating the multidimensional sleep disorder. Owing to misperceptions about the safety and effectiveness of treatment options, many individuals with insomnia may not seek professional treatment, and alternatively use ineffective home remedies or over-the-counter medications to improve sleep. Some physicians may even believe that insomnia is remediated by simply having the patient \"get more sleep\". Unfortunately, treatment of insomnia is not always that simple. The disorder's complex underlying pathophysiology warrants consideration of different nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment options. Indeed, recent insights gained from research into the pathophysiology of insomnia have facilitated development of newer treatment approaches with more efficacious outcomes. This narrative review provides a summary of the diagnostic criteria and pathophysiology of insomnia and its subtypes. Further, this review emphasizes new and emerging nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments for chronic insomnia, including recent enhancements in approaches to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and the new dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) pharmacologics. These advances in treatment have expanded the treatment options and are likely to result in improved outcomes in patients with chronic insomnia.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Daytime fatigue in teenagers may be hand-waved as hours of screen time the night before and it can be difficult for families to accurately describe sleep habits. These factors quite often obscure an underlying sleep disorder. Here we report the rare case of a sighted teenage patient who presented with sleep disturbance and erratic bedtimes and was found to have non-24-hour sleep wake disorder (N24SWD). Report of case(s) 16-year-old male with a past medical history of ADHD and insomnia, presented to clinic for evaluation of recurrent and inappropriate sleep time with residual hypersomnolence. Pediatrician first saw the patient for difficulty waking up for school as well as trouble falling asleep at night. Initially, it was suspected to be insomnia due to poor sleep hygiene secondary to significant electronic usage prior to bedtime. When symptoms did not improve, the patient was started on hypnotics including clonidine to help with sleep and daytime stimulant medication was adjusted to help with wakefulness. Pharmaceuticals did not help with sleep symptoms, and the patient’s hypersomnolence led to cyclical absenteeism from school and risk for expulsion. On initial presentation to the sleep clinic, patient and family had difficulty describing his erratic sleep routine. Two weeks of sleep diaries were provided to help characterize the patient’s sleep patterns. No suspicion for sleep disordered breathing, parasomnias nor restless leg syndrome were noted. Sleep diary showed a sleep pattern delaying consistently by 1-2 hours each day. Total sleep each night was 7-9 hours, with sleep onset latency of 30 minutes and no significant awakenings. This activity is classic for non-24 sleep-wake phase disorder. This patient was treated with a combination of timed tasimelteon and bright light therapy along with chronotherapy for resynchronization of the intrinsic circadian rhythm. Conclusion N24SWD is commonly seen in blind individuals affecting up to 50% of that population. It is very rare in sighted individuals, and may be harder to discern when confounded with conditions like ADHD or poor sleep hygiene. Having patients complete a sleep diary is a cost effective and low investment intervention that may elucidate their condition and ensure timely treatment. Support (if any)",

Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social cognition and communication, restricted interests, and stereotyped behaviors. It is often associated with sensory dysfunctions, other neurodevelopmental disorders, neuropsychiatric disorders, epilepsy and/or sleep disorders. This condition will accompany people throughout their lives, with variations in its evolution. In the last ten years, only 1% of all autism research focused on developing post-secondary education programs and training in adult health services. Taking into account this dichotomy of interests, we must think about the different stages of life, such as early intervention, school inclusion, bullying, associated mental and medical disorders, lack of group belonging, job opportunities and the aging. Only by becoming aware of each of them can we achieve a better quality of life for people with autism and their families.El autismo es un trastorno del neurodesarrollo de base neurobiológica caracterizado por déficits en la cognición social y la comunicación, intereses restringidos y conductas estereotipadas. Muchas veces está asociado a disfunciones sensoriales, otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, trastornos neuropsiquiátricos, epilepsia y/o trastornos de sueño. Esta condición acompañará a las personas a lo largo de toda la vida, con variaciones en su evolución. En los últimos diez años solo el 1% de todas las investigaciones en autismo se centraron en desarrollar programas de educación post secundaria, y formación de servicios de salud para adultos. Teniendo en cuenta esta dicotomía de intereses es que debemos pensar en las diferentes etapas de la vida, cómo el abordaje temprano, la inclusión escolar, el hostigamiento, los trastornos mentales y médicos asociados, la falta de grupo de pertenencia, las oportunidades laborales y el envejecimiento. Solamente tomando conciencia de cada una de ellas podremos lograr una mejor calidad de vida de las personas con autismo y sus familias.",

      "abstract": "Conversion disorder (now also called functional neurological symptom disorder) describes symptoms (of motor and sensory dysfunction such as limb weakness, tremor, visual loss, with or without ‘blackouts’), which can be positively identified as being inconsistent with neurological disease. The disorder is common in neurological services and frequently seen by psychiatrists working in such settings. It is often associated with chronic severe disability. The diagnosis previously hinged on the neurologist’s demonstration of the lack of disease and the psychiatrist’s hypothesis of a ‘conversion’ of stress into a physical symptom. It is now based on positive findings on neurological assessment supplemented by a psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression disorders are common. Treatment is multi-disciplinary. Explanation of the condition to the patient is a crucial initial step supplemented, where necessary, by psychological treatment (especially for dissociative or non-epileptic attacks) and physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms. The prognosis without treatment is poor once the disability is established.",

These problems result in insufficient sleep at night, which then results in an increased risk of falls, difficulty with concentration and memory, and overall decreased quality of life. Difficulties sleeping, however, are not an inevitable part of aging. Rather, these sleep complaints are often secondary to medical and psychiatric illness, the medications used to treat these illnesses, circadian rhythm changes, or other sleep disorders.

      "abstract": "The Behavioral Insomnias of Childhood (BIC) include a series of problems of sleep initiation, continuity, maintenance, and bedtime resistance. These sleep problems can place a significant burden on the parents who may be required to attend to a child at the beginning or in the middle of the night. The resulting sleep loss can impact parents' and children's daytime functioning and can increase bedtime-related conflict. Even when sleep problems do not meet criteria for a disorder, they can increase parental stress and parent–child conflict. Childhood sleep problems can be an indicator of poor regulatory capacity in the infant or child, and there is some evidence that sleep problems presenting in the first few years of life can be a marker of a diathesis for psychopathology. Even though sleep problems in early childhood are quite common and there are well-established interventions for these problems, little is understood about the pathophysiology of childhood sleep disorders. This chapter will review common causes of sleep problems in infants and young children that can persist into the later school years and adolescence. This will be followed by a detailed practical approach to evaluating and treating childhood insomnias.",

Sleep is a fundamental operating state of the central nervous system and it may be one of the most important psychophysiological processes for brain function and mental health. The study of maternal sleep problem including insomnia, however, implies deepening our understanding of family context. Family systems are dynamic and involve reciprocal interactions among members during day and night. So far, however, maternal and children's sleep has been rarely studied in a family perspective, and paternal sleep has often been neglected.Methods The present work summarizes in a narrative review the state of the art of our current knowledge on the role of insomnia and poor quality of sleep for mental health in all family members in the peripartum period. The mother, the father, the child and the family interactive perspectives are considered.Results Insomnia and poor sleep problems are frequent in all family members during peripartum. Poor sleep and insomnia symptoms are recognized as important risk factors for mental health in adults and children. Despite this alarming evidence, sleep is rarely assessed in clinical contextsConclusions Clinical implications include the utmost relevance of assessing sleep problems during pregnancy and early post-partum. Insomnia and poor sleep quality should be evaluated and treated in the clinical practice by using a \"family perspective.\"",

      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "abstract": "Few of us would say we routinely get enough sleep. Typical sleep duration has reportedly declined over the past half-century or so, probably due to the myriad changes in work and lifestyle that have emerged with our increased reliance on electronic technology. This is problematic, as sleep is critical to so many of our cognitive functions and health. Sleep facilitates memory consolidation, emotional regulation, decision-making and judgment and maintains normal levels of alertness and focus throughout the day. In addition to its effects on cognitive functions, sleep is important for many aspects of physical health and brain repair. During sleep, the brain rids itself of neurotoxins increases the number of brain repairing oligodendrocytes and replenishes depleted energy reserves. Without adequate sleep, people are prone to a host of health related problems, including inflammation, weight gain, and high blood pressure. But while it is easy to point out the problems associated with disrupted or curtailed sleep, it is much less clear how to intervene to improve people’s sleep-wake cycles.

      "abstract": "NON-RAPID EYE MOVEMENT (REM) SLEEPNon-REM sleep parasomnias are very common in childhood and are usually benign, rarely coming to medical attention.They typically arise from the first period of deepest non-REM (slow wave) sleep, around an hour after sleep onset.Over time, a spectrum of behaviours may be seen, even in the same subject, varying from brief confused arousals to frank sleepwalking.Agitated events may be seen, especially in younger age groups, leading to disturbing 'night terrors'.Despite apparent severe distress and intense autonomic activation, the child rarely recalls the nocturnal events.Because they are thought to reflect an incomplete transition from deep sleep to wakefulness, non-REM parasomnias are often termed 'arousal disorders'.Most non-REM sleep parasomnias improve through adolescence but may persist on a regular basis in at least 1% of adults.An enormous range of behaviours may be reported, some of which are complex and potentially hazardous.In adulthood, subjects appear to be more prone to exhibiting activities which may be considered 'goal-seeking' in nature, including eating or cooking.Males, in particular, while in a state of parasomnia, may engage in intimate relations with bed partners or display violence.Subsequent recall is invariably absent or severely diminished although some report dream-like or hallucinatory images, particularly if the parasomnia is associated with significant agitation.Common themes include spiders or other unpleasant visual imagery.Often, there is simply a sense of 'impending doom' causing the subject to rush from the bedroom, often vocalising and disturbing partners.It is usually possible to communicate at a limited level with subjects in this state although they typically display a degree of confusion and appear only partially awake.Typically, an adult with a significant non-REM sleep parasomnia will have events from deep slow wave sleep within an hour or two of sleep onset.Events rarely occur more than once a night but may cluster with several symptomatic nights in a week.Often, there are more prolonged spells free of disturbances.The behaviours across nights might be similar but are not precisely stereotyped.Triggers or precipitants are often identified and include internal factors that tend to deepen non-REM sleep (such as sleep deprivation) or external factors (such as an uncomfortable or noisy environment) which may partially arouse the deeply sleeping subject.Although controlled evidence is limited, short-acting hypnotics such as zolpidem may induce sleepwalking or similar behaviours in predisposed individuals.Similarly, alcohol in some may appear to trigger parasomnias, potentially through secondary factors such as sleep deprivation, increased snoring or a full bladder.By contrast, in clinical ABSTRACT It is common for general physicians to experience diagnostic doubt and trepidation whenever faced with patients who exhibit abnormal nocturnal behaviours or excessive movements at night.There is also a perception that expensive and often poorly available overnight tests are usually required for diagnostic precision.In fact, the majority of conditions, whether they be parasomnias or, more rarely, nocturnal seizures, can be reliably diagnosed from a directed history, if available.Although the evidence base for treating parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders remains minimal, accurate recognition is important for a variety of reasons.This review covers the diagnostic features of the full range of parasomnias and movement disorders that might present to a multidisciplinary adult sleep clinic.Throughout, it will be argued that the recognition of key or salient features obtained from a good history is the most important diagnostic tool.Indeed, when diagnostic doubt remains after a thorough sleep history, it is relatively rare for detailed tests to add much in the way of useful information.",

Au plan neuropsychologique, la differenciation avec la MA repose sur une double dissociation : dans la DCL, la preservation relative de la denomination, du rappel a court et moyen terme comme de la reconnaissance contraste avec l’alteration de la fluence verbale, de la perception visuelle et des performances visuospatiales. Pour diminuer les difficultes d’appreciation des fluctuations, les auteurs recommandent d’utiliser les echelles de fluctuations cognitives proposees par Walker et al. [2] (la Clinician assessment of fluctuation scale necessite toutefois une plus grande expertise que la One day fluctuation assessement scale) ou la Mayo fluctuations composite scale pour differencier les fluctuations de la DCL de celles qui sont observees dans la MA [3]. Les criteres histopathologiques sont precises, notamment la quantification des lesions de type Alzheimer. L’article se conclut sur l’interet d’un traitement combine par les inhibiteurs de la cholinesterase et les dopaminergiques [4]. Quant a la question des rapports entre demence parkinsonienne (definie par l’apparition d’une demence chez un parkinsonien de longue date) et la DC (dans laquelle les signes parkinsoniens ne doivent pas avoir precede la demence de plus de 1 an), le consortium considere que cette distinction doit etre maintenue pour des raisons cliniques, mais qu’au niveau de la recherche, clinicopathologique ou therapeutique, les deux phenotypes peuvent etre reunis sous le terme de maladie a corps de Lewy ou alpha-synucleinopathie ! 1. McKeith IG, Dickson DW, Lowe J, Emre M, O’Brien JT, Feldman H, et al.

      "title": "[The sleep problems among children with asthma].",
      "abstract": "Asthma is one of the most common chronic illnesses in children. Children with asthma often suffer from night coughing, wheezing and breathlessness that disturb their sleep. Nocturnal asthma is often associated with such problems as difficulty falling asleep, restless sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, daytime sleepiness, and daytime tiredness. These sleep problems not only occur in children but also in their parents, and furthermore affect their daytime activity. People with asthma should be aware that nocturnal asthma is associated with more severe symptoms and increased mortality. Several underlying mechanisms that may shed light on how and why nighttime seems to exacerbate asthma symptoms include the inflammation process, airway resistance, and bronchial hyper-responsiveness (all circadian factors) as well as gastro-esophageal reflux (a non-circadian factor). Nurses should understand the mechanisms of nocturnal asthma and conduct sleep assessments comprehensively in order to design and implement appropriate strategies to improve the sleep quality of children with asthma.",

      "title": "Sleep-related Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract As in many areas of sleep medicine, it is often a challenge deciding whether or not movements during sleep reflect truly abnormal nocturnal phenomenona or are simply physiological variants. Indeed, when asleep, subconscious shifts of body position occurring every 15 minutes or so are considered entirely normal, as are minor jerks of the extremities and face, particularly during periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. However, if nocturnal movements are observed to be excessive, violent, or arousing, either to the subject or bed partner, they will usually indicate a defined disorder, especially if the events are stereotypic through the night. Although the second edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) was revised in 2005 to include a new section dedicated to movement disorders occurring specifically during the state of sleep, diagnostic precision of such phenomena is often lacking and evidenced-based treatment protocols, when indicated, are poorly developed. Furthermore, if a sleep-related movement disorder is recognized, it can be very difficult to determine its true clinical significance for sleep quality and subsequent daytime wakefulness, especially in the elderly patient. This chapter addresses those movement disorders that are intimately or exclusively related to the state of sleep or the sleep–wake transition. By convention, parasomnias causing abnormal arousals from deep non-REM sleep, such as sleepwalking or night terrors, will not be covered, although restless legs syndrome is discussed, partly because of its close association with periodic limb movements during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Urodynamic analysis has revealed a high proportion of uninhibited bladder activity in adult enuresis. There was no associated neurological deficit to explain this abnormality. There was no correlation between the various diurnal symptoms and the presence of uninhibited bladder contractions. Enuresis was associated with obstructive uropathy in only 6 percent of cases. Some evidence has also been presented to support the concepts of ectopic sensory receptors and abnormal sphincter inhibition. A review of the problem of pathogenesis has suggested four main areas of possible abnormality: 1. A sensory lesion producing inadequate or delayed appreciation of bladder activity. 2. Cortical and subcortical dysfunction because of inadequate arousal or defective maturation of subconscious inhibition. 3. A congenital or acquired upper motor neurone lesion causing an uninhibited bladder. 4. A similar or related lesion causing an over-inhibited sphincter. These factors probably always occur in varying combinations. Because of the lack of association between symptoms, signs and objective measurements, there is a strong case for relating diagnosis, prognosis and treatment to urodynamic assessment.",

      "title": "Trends in utilisation of hypnotics among Scandinavian young people",
      "abstract": "We spend about one-third of our lives in a state of sleep. This makes sleep the single activity that occupies the most of our time.1 Today's society is burdened by insufficient sleep, and sleep deprivation is known to have an enormous impact on daily life and to be associated with a wide range of poor health outcomes. Daily life consequences include disruption of a person's ability to think and focus,2 which may be of particular importance during developmental periods such as childhood and adolescence. Medium- and long-term consequences include higher risk of mood problems,3 metabolic abnormalities and obesity,4 poor cognitive and academic performance 5 and even degenerative diseases such as dementia.6 Although most times underdiagnosed, sleep disorders are particularly common among children and young people, and even more so in those with comorbid mental health problems (including anxiety and depressive disorders) or neurodevelopmental conditions (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and autism spectrum disorders [ASD]).7 The prevalence rates of sleep disorders in children, adolescents and young adults are particularly hard to estimate given their high variability. This can be explained by a number of factors such as the age range of interest, inter-individual variability, discrepancies in reporting by patients and caregivers, different definitions of the various sleep problems in the current diagnostic classification systems, cross-cultural and contextual factors, and presence/absence of mental health or neurodevelopmental comorbidities.8 As an example, although we all know that insomnia is common among adolescents, studies may report prevalence rates that range between 7% and 40% depending on the diagnostic criteria used.9 In this study, Wesselhoeft and colleagues examined trends in the utilisation of three groups of hypnotic drugs, namely melatonin, z-drugs and sedating antihistamines among children, adolescents and young adults (age range 5 to 24 years) in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, from 2012 to 2018.10 The study shows that trends differed markedly among the three Scandinavian countries. In brief, in this period, melatonin and antihistamine use increased among young Scandinavians, and the increase was twice as high in Sweden as in Norway and Denmark. Sweden had the highest use of sedating antihistamines.10 With regard to sex-related differences in prescribing patterns, the authors found that males were twice as likely to use melatonin before age 15 years, whereas females were more likely to use z-drugs and sedating antihistamines after age 15 years. Data on prescribed medications extracted from public data registries are frequently used in the literature as a proxy to estimate the prevalence of various diseases. However, the authors raise a caution flag with regard to the interpretation of the main study variable, namely filled prescriptions for a particular hypnotic from 2012 to 2018. Throughout their work, the authors clearly state that the main aim of the study was to describe utilisation patterns of hypnotics and not prevalence estimates of sleep disorders. The study does not include information regarding the actual indications for hypnotic use.10 Assuming that all patients who take a given drug do have a specific disease may lead to overestimation of the prevalence of that disease. Many of these medications are frequently used for mental disorders other than sleep disorders. For example, drugs such as antihistamines may be used for the treatment of disorders highly prevalent in childhood, such as acute otitis media or allergic rhinitis. Conversely, patients with sleep disorders may be prescribed alternative hypnotic drugs that were not explored in this study, such as clonidine, one of the most commonly prescribed agents for children with ASD or ADHD and comorbid insomnia in the US, or trazodone for children with sleep problems related to anxiety or depression.11 This could lead to underestimation of the prevalence of sleep disorders. Furthermore, the data sources used in this study only allow the authors to report the proportion of individuals treated at any point during a given year and not at the same time, a difference particularly important for drugs such as melatonin that some patients use only briefly. The authors posit that the observed variation in hypnotic use among Scandinavian countries could reflect differences in the prevalence of sleep problems among Scandinavian populations. In this regard, they state that higher levels of general sleep and emotional problems in Swedish adolescents could be contributing to the higher use of hypnotics in that country. Previous publications show how sleep patterns and sleep problems may vary across different countries and cultures. The AdolesHealth Study assessed perceived sleep quality and duration in 1717 European adolescents from three different European countries (Spain, Iceland, and Estonia) aged 13 to 16 years and enrolled in public and private secondary schools.12 While no differences were found regarding sleep duration, Spanish and Estonian adolescents reported higher probabilities of having poor sleep quality. Sleep disturbances may also depend on contextual factors. For example, emerging evidence suggests that neighbourhood environment can impact paediatric sleep, such that children living in low-income neighbourhoods seem to be at higher risk of negative sleep outcomes, including shorter sleep duration, later sleep timing and obstructive sleep apnoea.13 Other contextual factors, such as the increasing use of social media and electronic devices by European youth have also changed sleep habits in children and young people.14 A recently identified and ‘unexpected’ contextual factor that has dramatically changed sleep patterns and has resulted in increased rates of sleep problems in children and adults is the COVID-19 pandemic and particularly the need for confinement. A recently published study evaluated sleep patterns, sleep disturbances and associated factors in Chinese pre-schoolers confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak.15 These children showed marked changes in their sleep patterns such as later bedtimes and wake times and longer nocturnal and shorter nap sleep durations, alongside fewer caregiver-reported sleep disturbances.15 The study by Wesselhoeft et al. does not address this possibility as it only includes data up until 2018.10 The authors propose some other alternative factors that could be contributing to the increasing rates of hypnotic use in Scandinavian countries in recent years (especially in Sweden).10 The increase in diagnoses of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD, particularly in males, and affective disorders such as depression, particularly in females, could partially explain the growing use of hypnotics and the sex-related observed variability in prescriptions. Variation in mental health care access among Scandinavian countries (Sweden has the highest availability of child psychiatrists per 100,000 young people in Europe); variation in prescribing practices among Scandinavian doctors, including reduced use of non-pharmacological treatments such as behavioural therapy and sleep hygiene psychoeducation, which would result in clinicians resorting to medication approaches; and changes in prescription with changes in EMA approvals are also posited as potential factors contributing to the observed trends in hypnotic use. In summary, healthy sleep is a good preventative measure for mental health especially in a vulnerable population such as children and adolescents.16 Not only are sleep disorders underdiagnosed but sleep symptoms are early predictors of the onset or relapse of many disorders. Prescription of hypnotics is only an indirect way to research this neglected area of psychiatry. Given this major challenge, we must not fall asleep at the wheel.

      "abstract": "The seemingly contradictory literature on the use of melatonin in insomnia is best understood by considering issues of time of administration (day or night), dose range (physiological or pharmacological), subject selection (normals or insomniacs), choice of dependent variable (self-report or electroencephalogram), and comprehensiveness of the reported variables (sleep onset or sleep maintenance). Available data on nighttime administration to normals and insomniacs are reviewed. It is concluded that there is not yet a convincing body of evidence, using generally accepted measures, that melatonin administration improves sleep in insomniacs with noncircadian sleep disturbance.",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

Clinical/neurological examination does not confirm any organic basis for the symptoms. Conversion disorders are more frequent in girls than in boys. They are rarely seen below the age of seven. A correspondence is often found between the personality of the child, (a conscientious attitude) and family relations. The families seem quite normal, but often have high expectations of their children, are sensitive to social stigmatization and have an underlying anxiety for health problems. A model is often found for the child's symptoms. Symptoms may be precipitated by an infection or a physical trauma. Sexual abuse is sometimes discovered. Multiprofessional assessment and treatment by a neuropediatrician, physiotherapist, child psychiatrist/psychologist and educational therapist may reduce \"doctor shopping\" and contribute to a favourable outcome.",

It is important to distinguish excessive daytime sleepiness from alterations in the level of consciousness, such as lethargy. During the night, a sleeper cycles through a series of sleep stages; this is called “sleep architecture.” Rapid-eye-movement sleep is the state in which most, but not all, dreaming experiences occur. Symptoms that seem bizarre and occur in association with nocturnal sleep or daytime napping should be considered as possible expressions of sleep pathology rather than psychopathology.",

This is a growing field of research, and the purpose of this brief review is to provide an update on the effects of creatine supplementation on brain health in healthy people.&#x0D; Description of the state of knowledge: Creatine, is an organic compound produced mainly by the liver and kidneys. From the liver, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract, creatine enters through the bloodstream into skeletal muscle, where a total of about 95% of the body's total creatine is stored. It is stored in the muscles, heart and brain.&#x0D; Summary: There is potential for creatine supplementation to improve cognitive processing, especially in conditions characterized by creatine deficits in the brain, which can be triggered by acute stress factors (e.g., exercise, lack of sleep) or chronic, pathological conditions (e.g., creatine synthesis enzyme deficiencies, mild traumatic brain injury, aging, Alzheimer's disease). People with depression, the elderly, people with diseases associated with certain genetic defects (where creatine production and storage in the brain is impaired) are just some of the groups of people in whom creatine supplementation may be helpful. More research is needed to determine the clinical impact of long-term creatine supplementation dosing strategies on brain function and health.",

      "title": "Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease): current insights",
      "abstract": "Abstract: The present review is focused on juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL; Batten disease) due to a mutation in CLN3 . Functional vision impairment occurring around 5–6 years of age is the first symptom in more than 80% of patients. Approximately 2 years later (though sometimes simultaneously), obvious signs of cognitive impairment appear. Behavior problems can occur in advance, especially in boys. These include anxious and depressed mood, aggressive behavior, and hallucinations, and even psychotic symptoms. Following the teens, severe dementia is present, including loss of memory, attention, and general reasoning abilities, as well as loss of independent adaptive skills such as mobility, feeding, and communicating. Sleep abnormalities, such as settling problems, nocturnal awakenings, and nightmares, are reported in more than half of patients. The vast majority, if not all, patients develop seizures, starting at approximately 10 years of age. Generalized tonic–clonic seizure occurs as the only type of seizure in approximately half of patients, and in combination with partial seizures in a third of patients. There seems to be no difference in seizure severity according to sex or genotype, and there is great variation in seizure activity among patients. Soon after diagnosis, patients begin to have slight ataxic symptoms, and at adolescence extrapyramidal symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia, slow steps with flexion in hips and knees) occur with increasing frequency. Chewing and swallowing difficulties emerge as well, and food intake is hampered in the late teens. Disabling periodically involuntary movements may occur as well. A progressive cardiac involvement with repolarization disturbances, ventricular hypertrophy, and sinus-node dysfunction, ultimately leading to severe bradycardia and/or other conduction abnormalities, starts in the mid-teens. Patients are usually bedridden at 20 years of age, and death usually occurs in the third decade of life.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep associated seizures especially Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (NFLE) represents a spectrum of challenging clinical manifestations presenting as complex nocturnal movements/behaviors, making the diagnosis often difficult. Report of Case A 64 y/o male, with history of ongoing complex movements occurring during his sleep, with no history of strokes or neurological deficits. Had extensive neurologic workup (all negative) including routine electroencephalogram (EEG), prolonged inpatient EEG (12 hours), and MRI of the brain. Home sleep study showing moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) AHI 24/hour successfully treated with CPAP therapy (residual AHI 1.7/hour) with improved nighttime symptoms initially. Wife recalls events as happening only at night while sleep, as patient often confused upon waking up in the morning, at times appear to sit up and smack his lips. No nighttime hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or acting out dreams were reported. Had two episodes associated with tongue biting and loss of bladder control. Another episode happened after a daytime nap, patient went outside and was mowing his lawn, went “completely blank “, appeared confused. No daytime or nighttime seizures were ever noticed. Patient do not recall any of the above events. Repeat EEG was normal. MRI/MRA of the head /neck showed small tiny focus in left frontoparietal lobe, suggesting remote cortical ischemic injury. Polysomnography (PSG) with seizure montage showed Interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) foci recorded in the frontal/frontopolar leads without accompanying body movements. Interictal spike and wave activity seen during stage N2. Initially treated with carbamazepine (had skin reaction) switched to levetiracetam with complete resolution of his symptoms. Conclusion This case illustrates the importance of reviewing the clinical history, behavior semiology, and diagnostic ancillary testing such as polysomnography with EEG monitoring in distinguishing nocturnal epileptic seizures from other nocturnal complex behavior disorders and parasomnias.",

The effects of such damage may be a degree of malfunctioning or disability with which the child and his family can easily cope, or there can be marked interference with the child's development and social adjustment. A child is considered handicapped if he is unable to play, learn, or do things which other children of his age can do, and is unable to achieve his full physical, mental or social potential.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is one of the most common clinical syndromes of somnological disorders, including any sleep disorders under sufficient time and appropriate sleeping conditions. Significant sleep disturbances are common in children who enter the intensive care unit. Between 18 and 65 per cent of children aged between 2 and 18 hospitalized in the intensive care unit have a clinical condition of acute confusion, better known as delirium. Sleep fragmentation, reduction of total sleep time, lack of slow, deep sleep and rapid sleep, and shift of sleep time are changes that can also act as insomnia triggers. Their presence worsens the course of the disease in the patient, prolongs the hospital stay, and increases the risk of complications and lethality. Circadian sleep disorder is a condition that requires close monitoring. Although insomnia therapy approaches are not yet reliable, early diagnosis of insomnia can reduce the duration of the delirium. Sleep assessment includes questionnaires and diaries. However, it was recognized that, despite the difficulties in implementing and interpreting polysomnography, it was still a gold standard for more accurate detection of changes in sleep phases and the difference between normal and abnormal sleep. In the absence of a polysomnograph, it is permissible to use a prolonged video assisted EEG. The inventive multimodal video-assisted monitoring method makes it possible to diagnose sleep disorders, pain syndrome and differential diagnosis of apnoea with cardiac and conductivity disorders or abnormal brain activity, including the presence of sub-clinical convulsions in patients of high-risk groups using a safe and non-invasive method for analyzing trends in the total bioelectric activity of different biological structures of a child. The validation of questionnaires according to the age of the child is also an important step in the timely diagnosis of sleep disorders in older children.",

      "abstract": "Les exigences operationnelles du metier de pilote sont susceptibles d'engendrer de la somnolence et des niveaux de charge mentale inadequats (i.e., trop faible ou trop eleve) au cours des vols. Les dettes de sommeil et les perturbations circadiennes liees a divers facteurs (e.g., longues periodes de services, horaires de travail irregulier, etc.) demandent aux pilotes de repousser sans cesse leurs limites biologiques. Par ailleurs, la charge de travail mental des pilotes presente de fortes variations au cours d'un vol : elevee au cours des phases critiques (i.e., decollage et atterrissage), elle devient tres reduite pendant les phases de croisiere. Lorsque la charge mentale devient trop elevee ou, a l'inverse, trop faible, les performances se degradent et des erreurs de pilotage peuvent apparaitre. La mise en oeuvre de methodes de detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale en temps quasi reel est un defi majeur pour le suivi et le controle de l'activite de pilotage. L'objectif de la these est de determiner si la voix humaine peut permettre de detecter d'une part, l'etat de somnolence et d'autre part, le niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Dans une premiere etude, la voix de participants a ete enregistree lors d'une tâche de lecture avant et apres une nuit de privation totale de sommeil (PTS). Les variations de l'etat de somnolence consecutives a la PTS ont ete evaluees au moyen de mesures auto-evaluatives et electrophysiologiques (ElectroEncephaloGraphie [EEG] et Potentiels Evoques [PEs]). Les resultats ont montre une variation significative apres la PTS de plusieurs parametres acoustiques lies : (a) a l'amplitude des impulsions glottiques (frequence de modulation d'amplitude), (b) a la forme du signal acoustique (longueur euclidienne du signal et ses caracteristiques associees) et (c) au spectre du signal des voyelles (rapport harmonique sur bruit, frequence du second formant, coefficient d'asymetrie, centre de gravite spectral, differences d'energie, pente spectrale et coefficients cepstraux a echelle Mel). La plupart des caracteristiques spectrales ont montre une sensibilite differente a la privation de sommeil en fonction du type de voyelles. Des correlations significatives ont ete mises en evidence entre plusieurs parametres acoustiques et plusieurs indicateurs objectifs (EEG et PEs) de l'etat de somnolence. Dans une seconde etude, le signal vocal a ete enregistre durant une tâche de rappel de listes de mots. La difficulte de la tâche etait manipulee en faisant varier le nombre de mots dans chaque liste (i.e., entre un et sept, correspondant a sept conditions de charge mentale). Le diametre pupillaire - qui est un indicateur objectif pertinent du niveau de charge mentale - a ete mesure simultanement avec l'enregistrement de la voix afin d'attester de la variation du niveau de charge mentale durant la tâche experimentale. Les resultats ont montre que des parametres acoustiques classiques (frequence fondamentale et son ecart type, shimmer, nombre de periodes et rapport harmonique sur bruit) et originaux (frequence de modulation d'amplitude et variations a court-terme de la longueur euclidienne du signal) ont ete particulierement sensibles aux variations de la charge mentale. Les variations de ces parametres acoustiques etaient correlees a celles du diametre pupillaire. L'ensemble des resultats suggere que les parametres acoustiques de la voix humaine identifies lors des experimentations pourraient representer des indicateurs pertinents pour la detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Les resultats ouvrent de nombreuses perspectives de recherche et d'applications dans le domaine de la securite des transports, notamment dans le secteur aeronautique.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are a group of sleep disorders that are characterized by the presence of undesirable behavioral, experiential, or autonomic nervous system events during sleep initiation, within sleep, or during arousals from any stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. During wakefulness and NREM sleep, the hypothalamus plays a central role in thermoregulation. REM sleep has a very distinct thermoregulatory response that is characterized by an inhibition of hypothalamic control over body temperature, with resulting poikilothermia. The role of the thermoregulatory features of REM sleep is currently unknown. Drawing conclusions from other parasomnias one can assume that a disorder could exist in which the thermoregulatory features of REM sleep are impaired. The existence of this condition may have eluded current research because most of the research on thermoregulation has been completed using animal models or healthy volunteers. If this disorder were to exist, it could be associated with metabolic disorders, or with neurodegenerative conditions, and perhaps it could be an early biomarker for alpha-synucleinopathies in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder. New and evolving wearable technologies offer the promise of facilitating the monitoring of core body temperature and the testing of this hypothesized thermoregulatory autonomic disorder and its clinical correlates.",

However other conditions have shown to have presence of sleep on REM episodes which include but not limited to obstructive sleep apnea, sleep wake schedule disturbance, alcoholism, neurodegenerative disorders, depression and anxiety Report of Case Here we present a case of 30 year old female with history of asthma, patent foraman ovale, migraine headache, and anxiety who presented with daytime sleepiness, falling asleep while at work, occasional scheduled naps, non-restorative sleep, sleep paralysis, and hypnopompic hallucination. Pertinent physical exam included; mallampati score of 4/4, retrognathia, high arched hard palate, crowded posterior oropharynx. She had a score of 16 on Epworth sleepiness scale. Patient previously had multiple sleep latency test at outside facility which revealed 4/5 SOREM, with mean sleep onset latency of 11.5 minutes. She however was diagnosed with narcolepsy and tried on modafinil which she failed to tolerate. She was tried on sertraline as well which was discontinued due to lack of benefit. She had repeat multiple sleep latency test work up which revealed 2/5 SOREM, with mean sleep onset latency was 13.1 minutes. Her overnight polysomnogram prior to repeat MSLT showed SOREM with sleep onset latency of 10 minutes. Actigraphy showed consistent sleep pattern overall with sufficient sleep time but was taking hydroxyzine and herbal medication. Patient did not meet criteria for hypersomnolence disorder and sleep disordered breathing. Conclusion There is possibility her medication may have played pivotal role with her daytime symptoms. We also emphasize SOREMs can be present in other disorders such as anxiety in this case and not solely in narcolepsy",

      "abstract": "Paroxysmal events in childhood are a challenge for pediatric neurologists, given its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often difficult to distinguish between phenomena of epileptic seizure or not. The non-epileptic paroxysmal episodes are neurological phenomena, with motor, sensory symptoms, and/or sensory impairments, with or without involvement of consciousness, epileptic phenomena unrelated, so no electroencephalographic correlative expression between or during episodes. From the clinical point of view can be classified into four groups: motor phenomena, syncope, migraine (and associated conditions) and acute psychiatric symptoms. In this paper we analyze paroxysmal motor phenomena in awake children, dividing them according to their clinical manifestations: extrapyramidal episodes (paroxysmal kinesiogenic, non kinesiogenic and not related to exercise dyskinesias, Dopa responsive dystonia) and similar symptoms of dystonia (Sandifer syndrome); manifestations of startle (hyperekplexia); episodic eye and head movements (benign paroxysmal tonic upward gaze nistagmus deviation); episodic ataxia (familial episodic ataxias, paroxysmal benign vertigo); stereotyped and phenomena of self-gratification; and myoclonic events (benign myoclonus of early infancy). The detection of these syndromes will, in many cases, allow an adequate genetic counseling, initiate a specific treatment and avoid unnecessary additional studies. Molecular studies have demonstrated a real relationship between epileptic and non-epileptic basis of many of these entities and surely the identification of the molecular basis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in many of them allow us, in the near future will benefit our patients. Fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos motores en vigilia en la infancia.Los eventos paroxisticos en la infancia son un desafio para los neuropediatras por sus manifestaciones clinicas altamente heterogeneas, muchas veces dificiles de diferenciar entre fenomenos de origen epileptico o no epileptico. Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migraña (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

      "title": "Overtraining Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Definitions Functional overreaching (FOR): intensified training results in a temporary decline in performance. When appropriate periods of recovery are provided, a positive \"supercompensation\" effect occurs, with the athlete exhibiting enhanced performance. Nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR): an accumulation of training and/or nontraining stress resulting in short-term decrement in performance capacity with or without related physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of maladaptation in which restoration of performance capacity may take from several days to several weeks. Overtraining syndrome (OTS): same as NFOR, except decrement is long-term and restoration takes several weeks or months. Key point: the difference between NFOR and OTS is the amount of time needed for performance restoration; therefore, the diagnosis of OTS can often only be made retrospectively (3). Pathophysiology Unknown, biochemical/hormonal hypotheses include the following: glycogen depletion, central fatigue/branched chain fatty acid depletion, glutamine depletion/immune dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, oxidative stress, hypothalamic dysregulation, and cytokine release/inflammation (1,2). The mechanism triggering these changes often involves a training error that results in imbalance between energy expenditure load and recovery. This typically occurs in combination with a complex set of psychological factors and environmental stressors (e.g., monotony of training, excessive competitions, sleep disturbances, interpersonal difficulties, academic/occupational stressors, illness, altitude exposure, heat or cold injury, etc.). Epidemiology Most commonly seen in endurance events such as swimming, cycling, or running Prevalence and incidence data for true OTS are lacking; the lifetime prevalence of NFOR/OTS is estimated to be approximately 30% for nonelite endurance athletes and 60% for elite athletes (2,3). Important Differential Diagnoses NFOR/OTS is a diagnosis of exclusion (1). Common: caffeine withdrawal, environmental allergies, exercise-induced bronchospasm, infectious mononucleosis, insufficient sleep, anemia, performance anxiety, inadequate carbohydrate or protein intake, mood disorder, psychosocial stress, upper respiratory infection. Less common: dehydration, diabetes mellitus, eating disorder, hepatitis, hypothyroidism, lower respiratory infection, medication side effect (antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihistamine, β-blocker), post-concussive syndrome, pregnancy, substance abuse. Rare but important: adrenocortical insufficiency or excess, congenital or acquired heart disease, arrhythmia, bacterial endocarditis, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus, malabsorption syndrome, chronic lung disease, Lyme disease, malaria, malignancy, neuromuscular disorder, chronic renal disease, syphilis. Evaluation Thorough history including chief complaint, training program, diet, medications, nutrition, illness, review of systems, and assessment of training goals. Hallmark feature in history: athletes with NFOR/OTS are usually able to start a normal training sequence or a race at their normal pace but are not able to complete the training load they are given or race as usual (3). Initial laboratory examinations: complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate/C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, iron studies, creatine kinase, urinalysis, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Consider monospot, hepatitis panel, Lyme titer, toxicology screen, and chest x-ray. Prescribe absolute rest for 2 wk. ○ If mood is adversely affected with full rest, consider relative rest with well-defined expectations. If improved at follow-up, focus on adjustments to training and prevention (as follows). If no improvement, consider NFOR/OTS: ○ Will require prolonged training rest and further workup ○ Consider consulting with a sports psychologist and nutritionist. ○ Sequence of advancing activity should focus on frequency, then duration, then intensity (1,2). Monitoring Monitor performance in time trials and standard exercise challenges. There are currently no good practical biomarkers for NFOR/OTS (2). Psychiatric indicators may be most useful. Examples include the Profile of Mood States and Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (1). A two-bout maximal exercise protocol has shown differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response for athletes with FOR, NFOR, and OTS and may have prognostic value (2). Prevention Considerations for coaches, athletic trainers, and health care providers (2,3): Maintain accurate records of performance and encourage athletes to keep a diary of training load. Emphasize adequate rest and \"time out\" periods when performance declines, when an athlete complains of fatigue, or after illness or injury. Individualize and supervise training program. Avoid monotony of training. Encourage and reinforce optimal nutrition, hydration, and sleep. Be aware of life stressors, and communicate with athletes about physical, mental, and emotional concerns. Consider regular psychological questionnaires. Schedule regular health checks with a multidisciplinary team.",

This dissertation studied the working of melatonin in individuals with intellectual disabilities who have long-term sleep problems. In their case, namely, sleep problems are often caused by a disorder in their own melatonin rhythm; in individuals without intellectual disabilities other factors (such as stress) often play a role. Melatonin not only turned out effective in the treatment of problems with falling asleep and continuing to sleep, but it also had a positive effect on behaviour problems during the day. Aggressive behaviour, such as hitting, biting and destroying, was reduced. Remarkably, in some patients the sleep problems recurred during the treatment after a few weeks because the melatonin was too slowly broken down. The advice is to only start a melatonin treatment after (in the saliva) the moment has been determined when the own melatonin production has started.",

It is often accompanied by a peculiar sense of discomfort, a desire to rest, and reduced motivation, referred to as fatigue sensation. Acute fatigue is a normal condition or phenomenon that disappears after a period of rest; in contrast, chronic fatigue, lasting at least 6 months, does not disappear after ordinary rest. Chronic fatigue impairs activities and contributes to various medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, epileptic seizures, and death. In addition, many people complain of chronic fatigue. For example, in Japan, more than one third of the general adult population complains of chronic fatigue. It would thus be of great value to clarify the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and to develop efficient treatment methods to overcome it. Here, we review data primarily from behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging experiments related to neural dysfunction as well as autonomic nervous system, sleep, and circadian rhythm disorders in fatigue. These data provide new perspectives on the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and on overcoming it.",

Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders fall mainly into the category of neurotic, stress, or somatoform disorders, as defined by the inter­national classification of disease system (ICD- 11, WHO, 2018). They refer to several disorders that include gener­alized anxiety disorder (GAD), phobic anxiety disorders, panic disorder (± agoraphobia), obsessive compul­sive disorder (OCD) and post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Collectively, anxiety disorders affect almost 30% of people in the western world during their lifetime, with PTSD and GAD amongst the most prevalent. In general, anxiety disorders are associated with neurotransmitter dysregulation and amygdala hyperactivity. Insomnia is the unsatisfactory quantity and/ or quality of sleep, which persists for sufficient time to affect quality of life. It is often associated with other mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, alcohol dependence) and physical (e.g. pain, neoplasms) pathologies, or iatrogenic effects (e.g. diuretic, β- blockers, statins, levodopa). It may require treatment if symptoms are troublesome. Chronic insomnia can last for years, and affects almost 10% of the popula­tion. Around 30% have symptoms that are occasionally worse, with higher prevalence in older age. Many factors interplay to generate a state of anxiety, but from a biological perspective one of the key central brain pathways involved in this process is the limbic system, which regulates an array of functions, including emo­tion, fear, behaviour, and memory. One vital brain area that processes fear reactions from the thalamus and cortex is the amygdala, with connections to the hypothal­amus, which can activate sympathetic reactions and the hypothalamic– pituitary axis (HPA). Activation/ inhibition within this pathway leads to altered neurotransmitter activity. Corticotrophin- releasing factor (CRF) is known to be released from the hypothalamus in response to stress, under the regulation of the amygdala. CRF acts to drive the HPA, promoting the release of ACTH from the pituitary and then cortisol from the adrenal gland. In effect, sus­tained CRF exposure may lead to limbic system up- regu­lation and the heightening of anxiety states. Moreover, dysregulation in this system and changes in central cor­tisol sensing systems (e.g. decreased receptor expression) may cause chronic anxiety. The locus coeruleus (LC), is another brain region partly responsible for regulating the sympathetic effects of stress, again under the control of CRF.",

In the pubertal period behavioural deviations and neuropsychic disturbances usually reach a degree of obvious pathology (psychopathies, psychogenias) in cases where a long-standing psychotraumatic situation is combined with unfavourable biological factors such as minimum brain deficit, severe and prolonged debilitating somatic disease, a shain of infections, and pathological heredity.",

DSPD is characterised by difficulty in falling asleep, and it results from misalignment of the internal circadian clock with desired sleep time. For those children for whom good sleep hygiene practice is unsuccessful, supplementation with melatonin is standard practice. Randomised controlled studies have shown that strategically timed administration of melatonin, typically in the dose range 3–6 mg, is effective in advancing circadian rhythm and sleep onset in a clinically significant manner. Supplemental melatonin is available in two formulations, immediate-release and controlled-release; for sleep induction as required in DSPD, immediate-release melatonin is considered to be the more effective formulation, as supported by 19 randomised controlled clinical studies (comprising more than 800 individuals), together with a meta-analysis. The safety of supplemental melatonin administration in children, particularly in the short term, has been well documented. Melatonin supplementation is relevant to a number of aspects of neuroscience nursing; in addition to improving sleep onset in children with neurological disorders, melatonin supplementation may be of benefit in intensive care patients following brain injury, in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, and in nurses themselves to counter the detrimental effects of night-shift working.",

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibility seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleovestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

      "abstract": "We reviewed sleep and dream-related clinical symptoms in a set of four neurologic disorders (Parkinson’s Disease, REM Behavior Disorder, Narcolepsy and Depression) characterized by severe reductions in dopaminergic function. Sleep findings included excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), increased rapid eye movement sleep times (REM%), increased REM density or bursts of REMs, reduced REM latency periods, and sleep onset REM (SOREM). Clinical symptoms included perseverative or rigid thinking and personality styles, frontal lobe impairment, increased complaints of, or vulnerability to negative affect, and increased vivid and unpleasant dreams. The increased vulnerability to unpleasant dreams was particularly interesting as descriptions of dream content were strikingly similar across all 4 disorders. Dreams of feeling threatened or being attacked by animals or dangerous creatures were very frequent. We hypothesize that the cluster of sleep, dream and cognitive changes associated with these four disorders can be explained by assuming that lowered dopaminergic tone leads to a disinhibition of REM physiology and amygdalar activity and that this disinhibition of REM and amygdalar function yields unpleasant dreams, negative affect, and frontal lobe impairment. Careful study of the cluster of co-occurring symptoms identified here may illuminate 1) the ways in which dopamine might function in regulation of sleep states, and 2) aspects of the neurology of dream content.

Insomnia may be the primary problem, or it may be associated with other conditions. Insomnia can be caused by physical factors along with psychological factors. Extreme wake leads to energy consumption, hunger, and increase appetite and if reaches the limit to be called insomnia, digestion is not performed completely. Many prescribed drugs can interfere with sleep, like certain antidepressants and medications for asthma or vital sign.

      "title": "What Do Patients Want in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder? Taiwan’s TAILOR Survey",
      "abstract": "In Taiwan, the number of patients being treated for depression has been increasing over recent decades, but there remain some key unmet needs for these patients. One issue is the low rate of help-seeking, which may be at least partially attributable to the stigma of depression in Asian societies. Stigma also contributes to underdiagnosis, because stigmatised patients may emphasise somatic symptoms (e.g. lethargy/fatigue, sleep disorders or changes in appetite), fearing how they will be perceived if they discuss psychological symptoms with their physician. Underdiagnosis may also result from cross-cultural differences, because assessment scales and screening tools are usually developed in Western populations and may not have the same validity in Asian patients. Depression in Taiwan appears to be undertreated, with a high rate of suboptimal antidepressant dosages and inadequate duration of therapy. Patients may discontinue treatment earlier than recommended for a number of reasons related to their own beliefs about treatment, their relationship with their physicians, or the effects of the medication (adverse effects, slow onset of effect, or lack of effect on comorbid symptoms). Moreover, frequently there is discordance between how patients and physicians define treatment success in depression. Patients are more likely to achieve a benefit from treatment which remains persistent when physicians and patients are closely aligned on treatment goals. To better understand the experiences, preferences and attitudes of patients with depression in Taiwan, the Target Antidepressant Initiation choice to unLock positive patient Outcomes and Response (TAILOR) survey was conducted in 340 adult outpatients receiving treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The results of the TAILOR survey highlight the personal and perceived stigma of depression, current barriers to seeking help and maintaining treatment, and opportunities to improve shared decision-making, medication adherence and clinical outcomes for Taiwanese patients with MDD.",

      "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as “cot death” is one of the most serious, unexplained tregedies of our times. The term “SIDS” is used when a sleeping infant, under the age of one year, who has apparently been healthy, is found unexpectedly dead, and forensic evaluation that consists of scene investigation, forensic autopsy and examination of the medical records of the child, is unable to discern a cause of death. Multiple sleep-related mechanisms have been proposed to cause SIDS. These mechanisms include suffocation/asphyxiation in the face-down sleep position, central and/or obstructive sleep apnea, impaired-state-dependent responses to hypoxia and/ or hypercarbia, inadequate autoresuscitation, defective autonomic regulation of blood pressure or thermal responses, and abnormal arousal to life-threatening challenges during sleep. It has been a somewhat controversial term that on one hand has been criticized for not being a proper diagnosis with pathognomonic features, contrasting on the other hand with situations where it has been uncritically and inconsistently applied to all manner of infant deaths. It has been argued that SIDS constitutes a disease with a single cause, an argument which is at odds with those who feel that it is instead a syndrome with common features, and probable heterogeneous and additive risk factors. For this reason it has been called a “diagnosis without a disease”. Despite the shortcomings of forensic medicine, the SIDS story over the past several decades has been one of the great successes in infant healthcare.",

The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities.

Each of these cognitive processes includes several components, which contribute sequentially to the homeostatic and circadian modulation of performance. Sudden (lapses) and gradual changes in cognitive performance occur with sleep deprivation or with time of day. The time course of human cognitive processes throughout the day is relevant to the programming of different human activities. The lowest level of cognitive performance occurs during nighttime and early in the morning, a better level occurs around noon, and even higher levels occur during afternoon and evening hours.

Because any serious disease can cause growth failure, the term FTT has little diagnostic usefulness. Classically, the etiology of FTT has been divided into organic and nonorganic types, with nonorganic FTT defined as growth deficiency without a diagnosable medical etiology and organic FTT defined as growth failure caused by a specific medical illness. A number of authors have questioned the adequacy of this dichotomous view, suggesting the need for a third category: \"mixed\" etiology. In this group of children, chronic, mild problems, such as recurrent otitis media in concert with behavioral problems, result in aberrant behaviors, such as difficult temperament, sleep disorders, and altered eating behavior, which together impair growth. Even in cases in which the growth deficiency is primarily due to organic or nonorganic causes, the problems seen in the children are often multiple (eg, infants who have cardiac failure also have feeding disorders). Given the multiple contributory factors to FTT and the lack of diagnostic specificity of the term, we recommend that it be abandoned in favor of the term \"growth deficiency,\" which describes the presentation of this entity: An underweight, often stunted, undernourished child.",

In the medicated patients, medical drugs are mainly responsible for their insomnia. However, it is sometimes difficult to find these drugs. The pathological sleep (i.e., delirium) are often developed following the drug-induced insomnia. Medication against insomnia (i.e., benzodiazepines) often exacerbates the pathological sleep. Therefore, common types of insomnia, drug-induced insomnia and pathological sleep should carefully be discriminated. Drug-induced rhythm-disorders and drug-induced sleep apnea remain to be studied. Future studies may clarify the effects of several drugs on these two disorders.",

A highly differenciated diagnostic effort is required as sleep in children is extremely variable between individuals, undergoes a constant natural development and depends of cultural influences on sleep behavior. The pathogenesis is predominantly due to environmental variables, especially to the child-parent interaction. Besides somatic diseases, as Sleep Related Breathing Disorders, Restless legs syndrome and nocturnal seizures play an etiologic role. Psychological and somatic factors in the development of sleep disorders have in common that they exercise a serious negative impact on cognitive daytime functioning and behavior. In this paper the interdependence of somatic and psychological factors and the relations between disturbed nighttime sleep and impaired daytime functioning will be discussed. Especially in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder these relations can be demonstrated. Conclusions are drawn for a specific, stepwise diagnostic approach in children's sleep disorders.",

Alcohol will interrupt sleep, inducing difficulty maintaining sleep. Sleep-related seizure disorders may prove quite difficult to identify but produce symptoms of nocturnal awakening, reducing sleep efficiency. Nonrestorative sleep suggests a difference in the distribution of sleep staging, implying an altered arousal threshold.

      "abstract": "Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients almost uniformly suffer from sleep disruption. Even though the role of sleep disturbances is not still adequately understood, they may be related to metabolic, immune, neurological and respiratory dysfunction and could worsen the quality of life after discharge. A harsh ICU environment, underlying disease, mechanical ventilation, pain and drugs are the main reasons that underlie sleep disruption in the critically ill. Polysomnography is the gold standard in evaluating sleep, but it is not feasible in clinical practice; therefore, other objective (bispectral index score [BIS] and actigraphy) and subjective (nurse and patient assessment) methods have been proposed, but their adequacy in ICU patients is not clear. Frequent evaluation of neurological status with validated tools is necessary to avoid excessive or prolonged sedation in order to better titrate patient-focused therapy. Hypnotic agents like benzodiazepines can increase total sleep time, but they alter the physiological progression of sleep phases, and decrease the time spent in the most restorative phases compared to the phases normally mediated by melatonin; melatonin production is decreased in critically ill patients, and as such, exogenous melatonin supplementation may improve sleep quality. Sleep disruption and the development of delirium are frequently related, both because of sleep scarcity and inappropriate dosing with sedatives. Delirium is strongly related to increased ICU morbidity and mortality, thus the resolution of sleep disruption could significantly contribute to improved ICU outcomes. An early evaluation of delirium is strongly recommended because of the potential to resolve the underlying causes or to begin an appropriate therapy. Further studies are needed on the effects of strategies to promote sleep and on the evaluation of better sleep in clinical outcomes, particularly on the development of delirium.",

Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional.

This is particularly relevant with regards to sleep and sleep disorders in the infant, child, and adolescent, in whom there are many significant differences from that of the adult. Nonetheless, there are also many similarities in the clinical features, pathophysiology, evaluation and therapy of sleep disorders between children and adults. This chapter, rather than repeating what has been described in earlier sections that dealt with adults, will, instead, emphasize the differences between these two age groups. The physiology, regulation, organization, architecture and distribution of sleep vary across the ages of one’s lifetime, from early infancy to elderly adulthood. Sleep among newborns is polyphasic (occurring several times throughout the 24-hour day). In early childhood, typically between the ages of 3 to 5 years, sleep becomes monophasic (occurring only once, generally at night). Some adults continue to prefer a biphasic sleep pattern with an afternoon nap and a major nocturnal sleep period. (Table 13–1).",

The present study randomly assigned older adults with secondary insomnia to a treatment group, 4 sessions composed of relaxation and stimulus control, or a no-treatment control group. Self-report assessments conducted at pretreatment, posttreatment, and a 3-month follow-up revealed that treated participants showed significantly greater improvement on wake time during the night, sleep efficiency percentage, and sleep quality rating.

      "title": "SINTOMAS DEPRESSIVOS EM ACADÊMICOS DE UMA UNIVERSIDADE PÚBLICA NO OESTE DO ESTADO DO PARÁ, RELATO DE EXPERIÊNCIA",
      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A depressao e um disturbio do afeto e/ou do humor, que e caracterizado por sintomas como, piora do sono, do apetite, da auto-estima, pela tristeza, sentimento de culpa, entre outros. O individuo depressivo tem dificuldade em descrever experiencias emocionais positivas, sendo pouco aberto a sentimentos otimistas. Alem disso, na depressao nao existe apenas queixa de tristeza, mas tambem ha mudancas de humor que culminam em crises frequentes de explosao de raiva, que levam ao desgaste da saude fisica e emocional, prejuizos no convivio social, na aprendizagem e ideias e/ou tentativas frequentes de suicidio. Esse transtorno e considerado uma pandemia e a terceira maior causa a nivel global de doencas. Sao inumeros os fatores que podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento da depressao, como por exemplo, o baixo suporte social, a presenca de eventos estressantes, pensamentos negativos, problemas financeiros, entre outros. Alguns dados encontrados nos universitarios nesta pesquisa, sao considerados elevados, no que tange ao processo depressivo, e ganham maior destaque ainda quando comparados com a populacao em geral. Isso e possivel, pois e nessa fase academica que se exige muito esforco do adolescente ou jovem adulto, onde o mesmo deve aprender a lidar com uma gama de responsabilidades que estarao presentes em sua vida futura, tanto como academico, quanto como profissional. Estes incluem a adaptacao de cumprimento de prazos e horarios, a distância dos pais e demais familiares, a falta de motivacao para os estudos, dentre outros conflitos internos e/ou externos. Diante dessas informacoes, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em relatar a presenca de sinais e sintomas depressivos encontrados em academicos de uma instituicao de ensino superior em Santarem- PA, atraves de uma escuta qualificada. Desenvolvimento : Este estudo trata-se de um relato de experiencia acerca das vivencias durante uma acao em saude que ocorreu no dia 24 de abril de 2017 desenvolvida por academicos de enfermagem da Universidade do Estado do Para (UEPA) Campus XII-Santarem, a acao foi baseada na metodologia ativa da problematizacao segundo o Projeto Politico Pedagogico (PPP) do curso de enfermagem da UEPA para a Atividade Integrada em Saude que e um momento em que o academico de enfermagem integra todos os eixos da grade curricular do semestre, escolhendo assim um tema a ser abordado, assim como o publico, que foi composto de academicos dos cursos contemplados na universidade: enfermagem, musica, educacao fisica, medicina e fisioterapia. A tematica foi abordada atraves de acao educativa em saude, organizada pelos academicos do curso de enfermagem com diversos topicos como: alimentacao, avaliacao de risco para o desenvolvimento de doencas cronicas, avaliacao de medidas antropometricas e, nesta atividade, avaliacao da saude mental com a investigacao da existencia de sintomas depressivos. Durante a acao os academicos de enfermagem, em um primeiro momento, distribuiram folders contendo informacoes sobre a depressao e, posteriormente conversaram individualmente com cada academico que, de forma voluntaria, concordaram discutir sobre sintomas que, de acordo com o CID-10, poderiam estar sentindo. Durante a conversa os sintomas investigados foram: fadiga aumentada ou perda de energia fisica e mental, perda de interesse e prazer, classificados como sintomas fundamentais; apetite diminuido, atividade diminuida, auto-estima e autoconfianca diminuida, concentracao e atencao diminuida, sentimento de culpa e inutilidade, pensamentos e/ou atos lesivos ou suicidas, sono perturbado, visao pessimista do futuro, classificados como sintomas episodicos. Alem disso, a acao contou com a ajuda de um psicologo que atendeu os participantes que apresentaram sintomas graves da depressao. Os participantes que apresentaram maior necessidade foram orientados a buscar tratamento efetivo com intervencao de psicologo. Resultados : A maioria dos entrevistados mostraram-se bastante interessados no assunto e nao demonstravam muita timidez, apresentaram-se bem a vontade e com disposicao para dialogar, o que de certa forma surpreendeu a equipe, que esperava uma resistencia por parte dos academicos, com isso observou-se facilitacao do trabalho para a equipe dos entrevistadores. Apos a entrevista, os academicos de enfermagem, organizadores da acao, detectaram uma alta incidencia de sintomas fundamentais e episodicos em um numero significativos dos universitarios, o que pode ser considerado uma situacao preocupante. No decorrer da acao, muitos academicos participantes, relataram o quanto consideravam acoes desse genero, importantes na universidade, por sentirem-se sobrecarregados pelas atividades academicas, desorientados, desanimados e com pensamentos pessimistas. Podem ser classificados como poucas as acoes voltadas para os academicos, sobretudo, os academicos da area da saude, ja que eles sao os principais responsaveis por promoverem esse tipo de acoes e que acabam deixando de se cuidar, nao lembrando-se que tambem precisam de cuidado e atencao. Deste modo, e inegavel a grande satisfacao de poder contribuir de alguma forma para esta comunidade e acredita-se que, todos os academicos tiveram uma boa oportunidade de serem ouvidos de forma mais qualificada por um profissional apto a lhe dar orientacoes essenciais que visem a prevencao diagnostica, alem de recuperacao e promocao da saude mental. Consideracoes Finais : Apos a acao em saude, alguns academicos que se ausentaram no dia em que a acao ocorreu procuraram a equipe afim de, saberem se haveria outra acao semelhante, alegando que gostariam de serem ouvidos ou ate mesmo referindo interesse de um amigo (a) na consulta psicologica. Essa experiencia aponta para a necessidade de que academicos na area da saude devem cuidar da saude mental de forma frequente sem negligenciar as tensoes e o estresse advindos da propria universidade, antes de serem lancados no mercado de trabalho. Alem da necessidade de acompanhamento psicologico para os academicos nas proprias universidades, sejam elas publicas ou privadas, no decorrer da formacao afim de manter a saude mental e de prevenir, diagnosticar ou ainda tratar quadros depressivos e outras doencas mentais que podem comprometer seu rendimento academico e a sua saude geral, visando reduzir dados crescentes relacionados a sintomatologia da depressao em universitarios. Essa experiencia mostrou que mesmo em cursos da area da saude, a saude mental ainda e pouco debatida, precisando assim, de uma atencao tanto dos academicos com sua propria saude, como da instituicao de ensino, promovendo um espaco e profissionais capacitados que possam auxiliar enquanto o academico estiver em formacao.",

The syndrome is quantitative rather than qualitative; that is, there are no clearly defined, outstanding symptoms. The onset is insidious and gradual, although the patient, usually a woman, may associate its beginning with some unusual dietary event, as a party, or indulgence above the ordinary in unusual foods. This event, however, should it occur, usually marks a culmination rather than a commencement. The several typical symptoms, which, let it be emphasized again, are quantitative rather than qualitative, are: (1) constipation; (2) fatigue, which is manifested by a marked disproportion between the mental desire for accomplishment and the physical inability of realization; (3) meteorism; (4) precordial or",

Apart from some overlap between enuresis and the (other) classic parasomnias, the sleep of enuretic children is no more problematic than that of the general population. Recently, the exciting possibility has arisen that the low arousability of enuretic children may be linked to the autonomous nervous system and to disturbances in the upper pons.Enuresis is not just a nocturnal problem but a disorder of sleep. The high arousal threshold is one of three major pathogenetic factors in enuresis-nocturnal polyuria and detrusor hyperactivity being the other two.",

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "abstract": "Perhaps as many as 5% of adults are excessively sleepy to a clinically relevant extent.1 The comparable figure for children is not known, but sleepiness is associated with many different conditions and, although a neglected topic, it can be the cause of serious psychological and social disadvantage.2Narcolepsy is by no means the most common cause of excessive sleepiness. Nonetheless, it is not the rarity once supposed, and poses special problems of recognition and management, especially in young people. The purpose of this article is mainly to review the clinical picture of narcolepsy in children and adolescents, emphasising the need for paediatricians, child psychiatrists, and others to take a wide view of the ways in which the condition can show itself. The clinical picture is often very different from that of the fully developed narcolepsy syndrome in adults. It is, therefore, at particular risk of either being overlooked or misconstrued.\n\nNarcolepsy is a neurological disorder, the main classic feature of which is excessive sleepiness during the day, with recurrent episodes of irresistible sleep (sleep attacks). In its fully developed form the “narcolepsy syndrome” also includes sudden loss of muscle tone in response to strong emotion (cataplexy), vivid dream-like experiences before falling asleep (hypnagogic hallucinations) or on waking (hypnopompic hallucinations), and episodes of inability to move after waking in the morning (sleep paralysis). Estimates for the occurrence of the non-sleepiness (“ancillary”) components of the syndrome are: cataplexy (all cases where cataplexy is required for the diagnosis of narcolepsy; however, others accept that in about 20% of cases cataplexy is not present), hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations (50–60%), and sleep paralysis (40%). These symptoms occur in various combinations and less than half of those with narcolepsy develop all four of them. In narcolepsy, overnight sleep is generally disrupted, causing some degree …",

      "title": "REM sleep behavior disorder - past, present, and future",
      "abstract": "The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a fascinating experiment of nature predicted by animal experiments nearly 40 years ago. Active paralysis of somatic muscles is one of the defining features of REM sleep. In the catmodel of REM sleep behavior disorder, bilateral perilocus ceruleus lesions result in loss of the expected atonia of REM sleep, resulting in dream-enacting (oneiric) behaviors. In humans, REM sleep behavior disorder presents as complex behaviors arising from REM sleep, as the persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep permits the acting out of dreams, often with violent or injurious consequences to the patient or bed partner. These behaviors include talking, yelling, swearing, grabbing, punching, kicking, jumping, or running out of the bed and may result in lacerations, ecchymoses, or fractures. The acute, or transient, form is usually drug-induced (most commonly tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] or serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). REM sleep behavior disorder may also be a manifestation of narcolepsy. The chronic form is seen predominantly in men (80-90%) over 50 years of age. Initially felt to be idiopathic, it is now becoming apparent that spontaneous REM sleep behavior disorder is often a harbinger of degenerative neurological conditions, most commonly one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or dementia with Lewy body disease). Interestingly, the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder precede any other manifestations of the underlying neurodegenerative disorders by an average of over 10 years. It is readily diagnosed by formal sleep studies which reveal persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep. Most cases of REM sleep behavior disorder respond dramatically to clonazepam administered at bedtime.",

The precise etiology of sleep bruxism remains unknown, but it may involve genetic and psychosocial components (such as anxiety and stress). Clinicians should be aware that quite often sleep bruxism is associated with other disorders, such as snoring, sleep-disordered breathing, sleep complaints, and behavioral problems. These comorbidities should be investigated, because they may be severe and prolonged if they are not treated. SB may lead to morning jaw muscle soreness or pain, headache, masticatory muscle hypertrophy, temporomandibular disorders, and tooth wear. Especially in pediatrics, sleep bruxism is usually managed with conservative therapies, such as sleep hygiene, behavioral modifications, biofeedback, familial counseling and, only in cases of severe tooth wear or other serious possible consequences of SB, soft occlusal splints.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sleep disturbances, including nightmares and insomnia, are prominent following trauma and with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and likely contribute to the pathogenesis of the disorder. Findings from laboratory studies of PTSD have been inconsistent in terms of documenting objective impaired sleep maintenance but have been somewhat more consistent in indicating alterations of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Studies of the early aftermath of trauma can reduce the complexity associated with chronicity and comorbidity, and may have implications for early diagnosis and prevention. Multiple studies indicate that dream content is affected by recent threatening experiences. The development of PTSD is associated with a more replicative type of nightmare content. Sleep is reported to be generally disrupted following trauma especially among those developing PTSD. The limited number of studies that provide objective recorded indices during the early aftermath of trauma also provide a mixed picture regarding overall sleep maintenance. Recent data suggest that a more specific disruption of REM sleep may be associated with the development of PTSD and that this disruption is associated with an increased signal of sympathetic nervous system activation during REM sleep. Disrupted REM sleep and increased sympathetic/noradrenergic activity may have implications for understanding recent promising interventions for PTSD sleep disturbance that can be applied to early intervention.",

Both on the experimental and clinical plan sleep deprivation has been considered to be responsible for psychotic disorders. Over the past fifteen years these results have been controversial. Polygraphic study of sleep in eight patients hospitalized in a post-operative intensive care unit confirmed this nightly sleep deprivation; the deep slow wave sleep decreases and there is often a lack of paradoxical sleep. Analysis of these eight cases corroborates the latest experimental résults on sleep deprivation and current methodological considerations. Sleep deprivation in itself does not seem to lead to major psychiatric disorders but it is one of the factors, contributing to genesis of psychiatric troubles in an intensive care unit. The other ones that have been suggested (environment, somatic pathology, psychological ill effects due to the hospitalization) are also quite important.",

      "abstract": "Non‐specialists can identify three types of developmental language disorder. (1) mixed receptive/expressive disorders, which impair phonology, syntax, and semantics. Children who understand nothing are nonverbal, in others speech is sparse, nonfluent, poorly intelligible, and agrammatic; (2) expressive disorders with adequate comprehension affect phonologic production‐predominantly. Children with verbal dyspraxia, the most severe variant, may also be nonverbal but comprehend well; (3) higher order processing disorders affect semantics, pragmatics, and discourse. Semantics and pragmatics are invariably affected in preschool autistic children in whom isolated expressive deficits do not occur. Etiology of developmental language disorders is predominantly genetic. Structural brain lesions detectable by neuroimaging are exceptional. Severe receptive deficits require a sleep EEG to detect subclinical epilepsy. Early educational intervention is both critical and efficacious.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSDs) are a family of sleep disorders affecting the timing of sleep. They result from a mismatch between the body's endogenous clock and external timing cues provided by an individual's 24-hour schedule. People with CRSDs typically cannot sleep or wake at the times required for work, school, or other social routines, but can generally get enough sleep if allowed to sleep and wake at preferred times. CRSDs diagnoses include delayed sleep phase type (DSPT), advanced sleep phase type (ASPT), irregular sleepwake type, free-running type, jet lag type, shift work type, and CRSD due to medical conditions. This chapter will briefly describe each disorder, its etiology, pathophysiology, and pathogenesis; predisposing and precipitating factors; associated morbidity and mortality; and associations, complications, and consequences.",

      "title": "Role of serotonin in modulating the development and function of adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb",
      "abstract": "The neuromodulatory transmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is synthesized by neurons located in the brainstem, which project more or less densely to the entire central nervous system (Charnay and Leger, 2010). Serotonin regulates a variety of physiological functions, including food intake, reward, reproduction, sleep-wake cycle, memory, cognition, emotion, and mood (Charnay and Leger, 2010). Consistently, dysfunctions of the serotonergic system are involved in the development or progression of mental disorders including autism, insomnia, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease (Charnay and Leger 2010). Many of these diseases (e.g., autism, schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease) present with concomitant impairment of olfaction (and memory), often accompanied by a reduced volume of the olfactory bulb (OB; Figure 1A) and hippocampus. These functional impairments may result from distorted adult neurogenesis in the respective neurogenic niches, as OB and hippocampal dentate gyrus are the two major areas of the adult mammalian brain where adult-born cells are generated throughout life. A wide range of studies documents the involvement of adult-born cells in short- and long-term olfactory memory; perceptual, associative, and fear learning, etc. (summarized in Lepousez et al., 2015; Fomin-Thunemann et al., 2020).Figure 1: Region-specific effects of serotonergic signaling on adult neurogenesis.(A) Scheme of the mouse head showing the location of the nasal cavity, olfactory epithelium, olfactory bulb (OB), and the cortex. (B) Magnification of the area, delineated by the broken line in A, showing olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs, orange) within the olfactory epithelium projecting to the OB and terminating in the glomeruli. Adult-born cells (green) arrive in the OB after migration along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) from the subventricular zone (SVZ). Serotonergic fibers (red) originate from the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei in the brain stem and target adult-born cells in the SVZ (1), RMS (2), and OB (3). OC: olfactory cortex; LV: lateral ventricle. (C) Upper panel: close-up of the three framed areas in B. Left: In the SVZ, radial glia-like cells (B cells) give rise to transient amplifying cells (C cells), which then generate neuroblasts (A cells). Middle: in the RMS, neuroblasts migrate along the glial sheets to the OB. After arrival, they switch to radial migration. Right: In the OB, neuroblasts mature to become granule (GCs) and juxtaglomerular (JGCs) cells. EPL: External plexiform layer; GCL: granule cell layer; GL: glomerular layer; MCL: mitral cell layer; ONL: olfactory nerve layer. Lower panel: serotonin (5-HT) receptors involved in serotonergic signaling in the respective region.Interestingly, adult neurogenesis and olfactory memory are positively modulated by fluoxetine, an antidepressant drug and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Siopi et al., 2016). Cumulative evidence points towards a specific role for serotonin in adult neurogenesis, as it has been shown that serotonin modulates the fate and functional state of adult-born cells throughout the entire life. Serotonergic projections innervate both the hippocampus and OB (Charnay and Leger, 2010), as well as their respective neurogenic niches, the subgranular zone and subventricular zone (SVZ) (Soumier et al., 2010; Garcia-Gonzalez et al., 2017). Serotonergic fibers innervating the OB originate from the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei and primarily innervate the superficial glomerular layer of the OB (Figure 1B and C), with sparser innervation of granule and mitral cell layers (Petzold et al., 2009; Fletcher and Chen, 2010). Interestingly, the serotonergic innervation of the glomerular layer of the bulb is not homogeneous, as the density and thickness of innervating serotonergic fibers vary between adjacent glomeruli. Within the neurogenic niche in the SVZ, serotonergic inputs run along the wall of the lateral ventricle (Tong et al., 2014). Here, the radial glia-like cells (B cells) give rise to transient amplifying cells (C cells), which then generate neuroblasts (Figure 1C). Serotonin promotes the proliferation of B and C cells in the SVZ (Brezun and Daszuta, 1999; Soumier et al., 2010; Tong et al., 2014). The thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is often used for identification of newborn cells, as it incorporates into the DNA of dividing cells and can later be visualized using immunohistochemistry. Lesioning serotonergic terminals or inhibition of serotonin synthesis leads to a substantial decrease in the number of BrdU-positive (BrdU+) adult-born cells in the SVZ (Brezun and Daszuta, 1999), while an infusion of the serotonin-releasing drug fenfluramine into the lateral ventricle of adult mice significantly increases the number of BrdU+ adult-born cells and doublecortin-positive neuroblasts in the SVZ (Tong et al., 2014). Consistently, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptor agonists increased, while 5-HT2C receptor antagonists decreased cell proliferation in the SVZ of adult mice (Tong et al., 2014). Besides, serotonin application induced depolarising inward currents in B cells, which were partially blocked by 5-HT2C or 5-HT5A receptor antagonists. The co-application of 5-HT2C and 5-HT5A receptor antagonists completely abolished serotonin-induced currents in B cells (Tong et al., 2014). Collectively, these data highlight the importance of serotonin in controlling proliferation and neurogenesis in the SVZ. After leaving the SVZ, adult-born cells - called neuroblasts at this developmental stage - migrate along the RMS towards the OB (Figure 1B and C). Migrating neuroblasts express Ca2+-permeable 5-HT3A receptors and serotonergic fibers, projecting along the RMS, have been shown to control velocity and directionality of neuroblast migration in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Garcia-Gonzalez et al., 2017). Moreover, a constitutive 5-HT3A receptor knockout presented with thinner RMS, smaller OB, and reduced density of parvalbumin- and calretinin-positive interneurons in the granule cell and the external plexiform layers (see Figure 1C for a schematic illustration of the OB layers). Upon arrival in the OB, neuroblasts change from tangential to radial migration (Figure 1B and C) and move towards the OB surface to become GABAergic interneurons in the granule or glomerular cell layers. Ninety percent of these cells become granule cells, while 5–10% migrate into the glomerular layer to become periglomerular or to a lesser extent short axon cells (Lepousez et al., 2015). The latter are collectively referred to as juxtaglomerular cells (JGCs). During the pre-integration phase, i.e. after arrival to the glomerular layer but before the integration into the local circuit (Liang et al., 2016), functional properties of adult-born JGCs differ from those of resident cells. Thus, adult-born JGCs show lower spontaneous ongoing activity, higher odor sensitivity, greater responsiveness to a larger number of odorants, and increased structural plasticity. When adult-born JGCs mature (approximately at 7–8 weeks after birth), their spontaneous and odor-evoked activities and structural plasticity become more similar to those of resident juxtaglomerular cells (Fomin-Thunemann et al., 2020). However, many adult-born cells do not survive the maturation process and undergo apoptosis ~15–45 days after their birth. Interestingly, daily treatment with the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin significantly increased BrdU+ cell survival in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus while the same treatment decreased survival of BrdU+ granule cells in the OB (Soumier et al., 2010). Taken together, these observations suggest that starting from their generation in the respective neurogenic niche and until their full maturation, the development of adult-born hippocampal and OB interneurons is controlled by the serotonergic inputs. But do adult-born cells preserve their privileged serotonergic inputs beyond their maturation, i.e. at times, when their functional properties are supposed to align with those of surrounding resident cells? Our data obtained in mature adult-born JGCs (Fomin-Thunemann et al., 2020) suggest that this might be the case: after application of the nonselective 5-HT2/5-HT7 receptor antagonist methysergide onto the OB surface of awake mice, we observed a significant and selective decrease in the ongoing activity of mature (> 8 week-old) adult-born JGCs. Surprisingly, the same treatment did not influence resident cells. This suggests that despite their abundance in the glomerular layer, serotonergic fibers preferentially target adult-born cells. What could be the functional role of this privileged connection? Serotonergic projections to the OB were shown to play a key role in selective filtering or attenuation of sensory inputs. Indeed, inhibition of serotonin receptors in general, and 5-HT2C receptors in particular enhanced odor-evoked responses in axons of olfactory sensory neurons projecting from the nose to OB glomeruli, whereas activation of 5-HT2C receptors inhibited these responses (Petzold et al., 2009). This effect was shown to be mediated through presynaptic GABAB receptors and was similar across all examined odorants and glomeruli, with stronger responses being affected to a greater extent than weaker responses. The authors suggested that this effect could be mediated by a subpopulation of GABAergic JGCs that express 5-HT2C receptors and respond to activation or inhibition of 5-HT2C receptors with a respective increase or decrease in odor-evoked Ca2+ signaling (Petzold et al., 2009). In addition to suppressing transmitter release from presynaptic terminals, GABAergic JGCs also contact and inhibit the postsynaptic targets of olfactory sensory neurons - mitral/tufted cells. Interestingly, not all JGCs analyzed by Petzold et al. (2009) were serotonin-responsive, suggesting that this property might be restricted to mature adult-born cells, as described above (Fomin-Thunemann et al., 2020). By controlling their ongoing spontaneous activity (Fomin-Thunemann et al. 2020), serotonergic inputs likely contribute to tonic presynaptic inhibition in the glomerular layer of the OB. Interestingly, serotonin-mediated reduction of sensory-evoked responses was also reported for visual and auditory systems (Petzold et al., 2009), suggesting that the ability of sensory gain control represents a general property of serotonergic inputs. Serotonergic raphe neurons are active during awake resting states, including grooming and rhythmic movements, but not during attentive states of sensory acquisition or sleep (Jacobs and Fornal, 1991; Petzold et al., 2009). Thus, depending on the internal state of the animal and external - environmental - stimuli, serotonergic projections from the brainstem, targeting mature adult-born cells, might influence the strength of the perceived sensory stimulus. Serotonin-responsive adult-born JGCs therefore might serve as coincidence detectors between the internal state of the animal (e.g., arousal, attention, expectation) and sensory inputs from the environment. In this scenario, activation of serotonergic inputs would help to filter irrelevant information, adjust the gain of the system to odor detection/perception, and to maintain responses of mitral/tufted cells within a normal dynamic range. Moreover, the overall reduction of sensory-driven responses during wakefulness might help to reduce the system's noise and to select salient information important to learn or memorize. In the olfactory system, serotonergic signaling was shown to play an important role in the formation of short-term memory and associative conditioning (Fletcher and Chen, 2010). For instance, in neonatal rats, odor-preference learning was impaired when serotonergic inputs were depleted. In adult rats, reducing or blocking serotonergic signaling impeded discrimination of previously learned odorants as well as learning of new tasks (Fletcher and Chen, 2010). In conclusion, serotonergic inputs support major steps of adult neurogenesis in both neurogenic niches of the mammalian brain, including cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Moreover, even after full integration of adult-born cells into the surrounding neural circuitry and maturation therein, serotonergic inputs convey unique functional properties to adult-born cells, enabling them to play a distinctive role in integrating environmental stimuli in a brain state-specific manner.

      "title": "Consciousness in Non-REM parasomnia episodes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of Non rapid eye movement (Non-REM) sleep. Non-REM parasomnia behaviors have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream-like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterize the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental disconnection associated with behavioral episodes, 35 adult patients with Non-REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in-depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviors (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterized by delusional thinking of varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni- or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%) and variable, but often pronounced amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (‘awake dreaming’). Surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people) or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness and sensory disconnection in Non-REM parasomnias is variable and graded. In their full-fledged expression, Non-REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep-related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

      "abstract": "Sleep and sleep deprivation are intimately related to performance. Sleep management of people working in different sectors of the society like multi shift workers, nurses, doctors, students in professional schools and the armed forces has a great bearing on performance, health and safety of the subject population. The detrimental effects of sleep deprivation on psychological performance are indicated as increased lapsing, cognitive slowing, memory impairment, decrease in vigilance and sustained attention and shift in optimum response capability. Its effects on physical performance are manifested as decline in ability to perform maximal exercise, self-selected walking pace and increase in perceived exertion. Sleep deprivation appears to have no effect in respect of muscle contractile properties and maximum anaerobic power. At high altitude (HA), there is a reduction in NREM sleep with frequent awakening due to hypoxia as a physiological adaptive measure to prevent accentuation of hypoxemia due to sleep-hypoventilation. Total sleep deprivation for 48 hours at high altitude can affect the acclimatization status, thermoregulation efficiency and cognitive functions. The concept of 'sleepiness' has also been studied, as it is an emerging concept for better understanding of the effects of sleep deprivation and its effects on performance. A special mention of sustained operations in the armed forces has been made keeping in mind its uniqueness in challenging the normal sleep-work schedule and its deployment in extreme environment and operational condition. This article reviews in detail the functions of sleep, its requirement and the effects of sleep deprivation on human performance.",

      "abstract": "The immediate response to the traumatic event in individuals who may develop ASD2 or PTSD involves intense fear, helplessness or horror. ASD is experienced during or immediately after the trauma, lasts for at least 2 days, and either resolves within 4 weeks or the diagnosis has to be adjusted. A diagnosis of PTSD may be appropriate provided the full criteria for PTSD are met [2]. Of individuals who respond to the trauma with intense fear or horror 15–35% will eventually develop a significant degree of dysfunction and distress [3], namely PTSD, for a considerable length of time. The PTSD symptoms can be grouped into three main clusters. The first is persistent re-experience of the traumatic event, such as recurrent dreams and flashbacks. The second is persistent avoidance of internal or external cues associated with the trauma, such as avoiding thoughts, avoiding activities, diminished interest, detachment, restricted affect, and sense of foreshortened future. The third is increased arousal, which is manifested as difficulty in concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response [2]. The marked discrepancy between the proportion of the general population exposed to traumatic events and the proportion that ultimately fulfills the criteria for PTSD is a challenging aspect of the study of stress-related disorders. Identification of factors that increase vulnerability of individuals and factors that increase resilience may have important implications in public health.

The diagnostic work-up should be completed if the condition does not resolve after five years of age or in older children who experience a recurrence of nocturnal enuresis. This case report presents a 12-year-old boy with nocturnal enuresis secondary to hyperthyroidism. In many cases, nocturnal enuresis is linked to emotional disorders (like school or family problems), but increasingly the condition is rather a consequence than the reason. Currently, nocturnal polyuria, inadequate capacity of the urinary bladder and functional urinary tract disorders are considered to be the most common causes of nocturnal enuresis. It happens, however, that the background of bedwetting is more complex and the diagnosis is not so obvious.",

      "abstract": "Sleep in dementias has been mainly studied in Alzheimer disease (AD). Sleep disturbances are found in 25 to 35% of subjects with AD. Subjective and objective disturbances are described. Long nocturnal awakenings disrupt sleep; total sleep time and sleep efficiency are reduced. Slow wave sleep is decreased and sometimes disappears. REM sleep percentage is also reduced and at a later stage of the disease, REM latency is increased. Sleep fragmentation can be associated with excessive daytime napping and sleepiness, and with other behavioral symptoms such as the sundowning syndrome and nocturnal agitation. Sleep abnormalities closely parallel the level of severity of dementia. The rest/activity ratio and the sleep-wake rhythms are more and more disturbed; the phase delay of the temperature rhythm is associated with the severity of the sundowning syndrome. Sleep disturbances and behavioral symptoms are the main reasons to institutionalize the patient. Sleep disturbances are related to multiple factors. Pathophysiological changes resulting of the disease itself, such as damage to the cholinergic pathways and to the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, contribute to sleep changes in AD. Associated medical and psychiatric illness and their different treatments as well as environmental factors also induced sleep disturbances. Sleep-disordered breathing is a highly prevalent condition in AD patients and restless leg syndrome may account for nocturnal agitation. In Parkinson and in Lewy body dementias, sleep disturbances are more severe than in DA and REM sleep behavior disorder can precede by several years these diseases. Sleep attacks and sleepiness are very frequent in Parkinson disease. Specific etiologies should drive specific treatment. Several non pharmacologic treatments are usually associated to treat sleep disturbances in AD: information, increased daytime physical, social activities to minimize daytime naps and exposure to bright light. Some studies found advantages to associate melatonin in the evening.",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal enuresis (NE) is characterized by the involuntary discharge of urine at night in those 5 years of age or older. Primary NE (PNE) is diagnosed in an individual who has never achieved nighttime dryness; in secondary NE (SNE), incontinence follows a dry period of at least 6 months. In either, the enuresis must not be due exclusively to a medical condition or diuretic therapy. Prevalence is estimated at 5% to 10% among 5-year-olds, 3% to 5% among 10-year-olds, and 1% among those 15 years of age and older. Between 5% and 10% of cases resolve annually without treatment. (1) The causes of PNE and SNE remain unclear, although physical, neurologic, and psychological factors; genetics; sleep structure; and other medical conditions have been implicated. (2)Treatment for NE includes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options, and many families are interested in complementary and integrative approaches. This review assesses the efficacy and safety of acupuncture/acupressure, hypnosis, and biofeedback in treating NE.Originally developed as a health-care tool in China thousands of years ago, the stimulation of specific points on the body (called acupoints) may be carried out by a variety of techniques, including insertion of thin needles (acupuncture), surface pressure (acupressure), electricity (electro-acupuncture), and laser (laser acupuncture). The effect of acupuncture on PNE was assessed through two recent systematic reviews. (3)(4) The Cochrane review summarized the results of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). (5)(6)(7)In the first study, 111 patients ages 5 to 15 years were assigned randomly to two different forms of acupuncture. (5) In the treatment group, a needle was embedded under the skin and left in place; in the control group, a needle was placed on the skin surface for 30 minutes each day. The number of treatment courses (of 6 days each) depended on response; follow-up times were not reported. At the end of the study, 54% (30/56) of patients in the treatment group attained 14 consecutive dry nights compared with 31% (17/55) in the control group. Adverse events were not mentioned.In the second study, 100 patients were assigned to two groups: 80 to the acupuncture group and 20 to the drug group. (6) Patient ages were reported only for the acupuncture group, with most patients between 5 and 21 years of age. In this group, patients received needle acupuncture daily for 10 days. In the drug group, patients received a combination of drugs: meclofenoxate (200 mg four times a day), oryzanol (20 mg three times a day), and thiamine (25 mg three times a day) for 10 days. The number of treatment courses (of 10 days each) varied. At the end of the study, 73% (58/80) of patients in the acupuncture group reached 14 consecutive dry nights compared with 10% (2/20) in the drug group. Adverse events were not mentioned. The conclusions from this study are limited because reporting of methods and patient demographics were incomplete.In the third study, 40 patients ages 5 to 16 years were assigned randomly to laser acupuncture or pharmacotherapy for 3 months. (7) In the acupuncture group, patients received laser acupuncture (for 30 seconds three times per week to a maximum of 15 treatments). In the drug group, patients received intranasal desmopressin (between 20 and 40 mcg, as needed). Response was defined as a decrease in wet nights of 90%, partial response as a decrease of 50%, and nonresponse as a decrease of less than 50%. At the end of the study, response was reported to be 80% (16/20) for the acupuncture group and 70% (14/20) for the drug group. A similar level of response was reported 6 months after the study. No adverse events occurred in either group. The conclusions from this study are limited because of the small sample size and subsequent lack of statistical power.A second systematic review identified 10 additional studies that compared acupuncture with either a different form of acupuncture or another traditional Chinese medicine therapy such as herbs. (4) Few study details were provided in the review. The authors concluded that although there was tentative evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture in NE, the quality of the included studies was very low. Because of the types of comparison groups used, the usefulness of the studies in the context of Western medicine is limited.One additional RCT compared acupressure with oxybutynin therapy in 24 patients ages 4 to 13 years. (8) Three patients had experienced unsuccessful pharmacologic treatments previously and were assigned to receive acupressure. The acupressure group received daily acupressure from their parents; the other group received 0.4 mg/kg of oxybutynin daily. Response was classified as complete, partial (reduction in bedwetting), or none and was scored by the parents at the following time points: 15 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the start of treatment. The authors reported that although there was no statistically significant difference between groups at any time point, the values for complete response were consistently higher for the acupressure group. The complete response rate at each time point was reported as 25%, 58%, 75%, and 83% for acupressure and 8%, 25%, 50%, and 58% for oxybutynin. No adverse events were reported. The conclusions from this study are limited because of the small sample size and because three patients were assigned directly to the acupressure group.We were unable to combine data from any of these studies because of the variability in treatments and controls used. Overall, acupuncture and acupressure appear promising, but the scientific and clinical relevance of these studies is limited due to the methodologic points identified for each. To strengthen the evidence of the utility of acupuncture in treating PNE, studies must be conducted with increased methodologic rigor and verified by replication. Additional comparative effectiveness research would help clarify the optimal role of acupuncture in the context of Western conventional care. No adverse events were reported.The use of hypnosis for PNE was summarized in a recent Cochrane systematic review that presented the results of two studies, an RCT and a controlled clinical trial. (3) In the RCT, 48 boys ages 8 to 13 years were assigned randomly to one of four groups: trance plus suggestions (group A), suggestions without trance (group B), trance alone (group C), and wait list (group D). (9) Groups A, B, and C received 1-hour sessions each week for 6 weeks. The mean number of dry nights after the trial were higher for these groups than for group D. Improvements were observed after 6 months for groups A, B, and C but not for group D; however, the study authors reported that only groups A and B showed significant improvement and that the effect may have been due to the suggestions rather than to the hypnosis. The conclusions for this study are limited because of small sample size and incomplete reporting of methods and results. In addition, the four groups differed with respect to number of dry nights at baseline.In the controlled clinical trial, 50 patients ages 5 to 16 years were assigned alternately to hypnosis or imipramine therapy for 3 months. (10) Patients in the hypnosis group received two 30-minute sessions in week 1, one session in week 2, then sessions every 1 to 2 weeks. The imipramine patients received 25 mg each night, which was increased weekly if there was no response. The number of patients who were dry or improved at 3 months was similar between groups (18/25 for hypnosis compared with 19/25 for imipramine). However, after treatment ended, many more patients relapsed who received imipramine than hypnosis (13/19 versus 1/18).In one additional RCT, 89 patients ages 7 to 12 years who had PNE were randomized to either hypnosis or alarms. (11) Patients in the hypnosis group received an audiotape for use at bedtime until they were dry. Patients in the alarm group received instruction on using an alarm. A successful outcome was achieved by 19% of the hypnosis group compared with 55% of the alarm group. Relapse was experienced by two hypnosis and six alarm patients.As for the acupuncture studies, methodologic variation prevented the combining of data for analysis. Studies that have increased methodologic rigor would strengthen the evidence of hypnosis for PNE, as would replication of results. No adverse events were reported.To our knowledge, the use of biofeedback in NE has not been investigated through controlled clinical trials. We present the results from six prospective observational studies that specifically reported on the effect of biofeedback on NE of various causes (Table). The types of biofeedback used in these studies fall into two categories. In the first category (type I), voiding muscles are monitored with perianal electrodes. Children who have full bladders practice voiding control exercises and receive feedback of muscle activity on a visual display. The specific exercises generally consist of a series of muscle contractions to allow patients to understand how to relax their pelvic floor musculature and external urethral sphincter to help with coordinated voiding. Four studies used type I biofeedback in children who had voiding dysfunction alone (12)(13) or who had vesicoureteral reflux (14) or vesical voluntary sphincter/pelvic floor dyssynergia. (15) Results for all studies were positive, resulting in most patients being cured or improving.The second category of biofeedback (type II) is characterized by repeated cycles of bladder filling and voiding. A catheter is inserted into the bladder and used to fill the bladder with liquid, after which the patient practices controlled voiding, sometimes with a visual display showing muscle activity. One study using type II biofeedback in children who had PNE reported that 71% were cured and 25% improved. (16)The conclusions for all of the included studies were limited by the observational designs used and some by small sample sizes. All of the identified studies showed benefit and little risk of harm, suggesting the need for methodologically rigorous studies, including RCTs, to determine the relative effect of biofeedback compared with that of various controls. No adverse events were reported.Of the four studies investigating acupuncture/acupressure for PNE, results were either better than or similar to control techniques, including medications. Due to low quality and methodologic limitations, more rigorous studies are recommended. The results of the three hypnosis studies on PNE were mixed; replication of the studies would strengthen the evidence. Of the six observational studies of biofeedback, all reported cure or improvements over baseline. Controlled studies may provide more convincing evidence of the effect of biofeedback on NE. Studies suggest that acupuncture/acupressure, hypnosis, and biofeedback may offer nonpharmacologic treatments that can be used in conjunction with conventional interventions or when conventional interventions have failed or are contraindicated.No adverse events were reported for any of the interventions, suggesting that they are safe. However, the sample size in many of the studies was small, limiting their ability to detect harmful effects. Although the safety of acupuncture has been well documented, (17) the safety of hypnosis and biofeedback has been less well defined. A recent review of mind-body techniques concluded that negative effects generally are mild and transitory. (18) In situations in which safety information is lacking, use of a safety/efficacy grid such as that proposed by Cohen and Eisenberg (19) may be warranted.The authors gratefully acknowledge Connie Wither for her expert help with literature searching, Ashley Whidden for her help in initial literature screening, Sana Ishaque for data extraction, and Amy Moen for coordination of the series.",

Sleep deprivation is a stressor, and its’ effects depend on an individual’s prior sleep deficit and distribution during the day. Sleep deprivation can be partial, total, acute, or chronic or specifically focused on one of the sleep phases. Sleep deprivation affects a large spectrum of vital systems such as thermoregulation, energy and mineral balance, and immunofunction. Based on the fact that sleep is a very important process for the normal development of many metabolic pathways, it is logical to think that insomnia has serious organism consequences. Functional irregularities of different organs are always reflected in structural changes that can be identified with imaging techniques. Imaging methods can also help identify problems of animals insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a frequent sleep-related breathing disorder in children with a prevalence of approximately 3% between the ages of 3 and 8. Its origin is multifactorial (hypertrophy of pharyngeal soft tissues, narrowing of the bone airways, damage to the neuromuscular tone). The symptoms and clinical signs to look for during the day and at night are directly related to upper airway (UA) obstruction or poor sleep quality. After a complete anamnestic and clinical evaluation, including nasofibroscopy, the ENT specialist will refer to an adeno-amygdalectomy or night recording by polysomnography or polygraph to confirm the diagnosis in the child. Among adolescents, the prevalence of OSAS is reported to be between 0.5 and 6%. The main risk factors are obesity, male sex and a history of tonsillectomy. In addition to the classic symptoms of childhood OSAS, this syndrome may, in adolescents, manifest itself as a misleading semiology of dyssomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and/or mood disorders. Differential diagnoses with risk behaviours, phase delay or narcolepsy should be systematically discussed. It is essential to record breathing during sleep. Even if the obstructive apnea/hypopnea index is low, it must be considered. In both children and adolescents, multidisciplinary management (ENT, orthodontist, maxillofacial physiotherapist, pulmonologist) should be early in order to avoid neurocognitive, behavioural, cardiovascular and metabolic complications. Maxillofacial surgery can be discussed from the age of 15. It is important not to forget to pay attention to the rules of healthy living and sleep as well as the management of obesity.",

      "abstract": "Depressive disorders are commonly associated with sleep disturbances including insomnia, hypersomnia, and nightmares. Based on shared neurobiological mechanisms, a bidirectional link exists between sleep disturbances and depressive disorders. Presence of sleep disturbance is not only associated with increased depression severity but also portends a poorer prognosis with increased suicide risk in patients with depressive disorders. Polysomnographic findings such as reduced slow-wave sleep, decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency and increased REM density are associated with major depression. Comorbid primary sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and circadian rhythm disorders not only increase the risk but also complicate the treatment of major depression. It is imperative to comprehensively assess and treat sleep disturbances, either due to depression or due to co-existing primary sleep disorders, to optimize remission, prevent relapse, and reduce the risk of suicide in patients with depressive disorders. Medications, chronotherapies, and behavioral approaches alone or in combination may prove to be effective in treating sleep disturbances associated with depressive disorders; however, more research is warranted in this area to determine the optimal management strategies. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, a promising treatment for management of insomnia comorbid with major depression, needs wider implementation and more research to establish its efficacy in preventing suicide.",

      "abstract": "Among the challenges most difficult to treat in the spectrum of pediatric anxieties are severe, persistent nighttime terrors (e.g., anticipating or \"perceiving\" the presence of monsters or other creatures under the bed or in the closet, nightmares) that disrupt a child's sleep, impact his or her overall adjustment, negatively affect the quality of family life, and may eventually require clinical assessment and intervention. This article describes a compounded preparation that has proven successful in combatting such fears and enabling the recovery of children so afflicted.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances: Core symptoms of major depressive disorder rather than associated or comorbid disorders",
      "abstract": "Depression is increasingly prevalent in Western countries. It has severe consequences and is associated with increased rates of disability, morbidity, and mortality. Despite numerous therapeutic options, a great number of depressed patients do not achieve full remission. In addition, despite good short-term outcomes, long-term therapeutic results remain disappointing and associated with a poor prognosis, raising significant concern in terms of public health. Impaired sleep – especially insomnia – may be at least partly responsible for this problem. Very close relationships between major depressive disorder (MDD) and sleep disorders have been observed. In particular, residual symptoms of sleep disturbance in a remitted patient may predict a relapse of the disease. However, most currently available antidepressants do not always take into consideration the sleep disturbances of depressed patients; some agents long used in clinical practice even appear to worsen them by their sleep-inhibiting properties. But some other new medications were shown to relieve early sleep disturbance in addition to alleviating other depression-related symptoms. This positive impact should promote compliance with medication and psychological treatments, and increase daytime performance and overall functioning. Complete remission of MDD appears therefore to depend on the relief of sleep disturbances, a core symptom of MDD that should be taken into consideration and treated early in depressed patients.",

      "abstract": "Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) refers to any situation in which an individual is unable to completely close the nasal airway during speech.The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of a complex group of structures that act in unison to control airflow through the nose and mouth by elevation of the soft palate and constriction of both the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls (►Fig. 1).Any disruption in this mechanism may result in abnormal, poorly intelligible speech.VPD can manifest as hypernasality, nasal emission, decreased vocal intensity, and/or facial grimacing. 1Moreover, patients who suffer from VPD will frequently develop maladaptive articulations to compensate for their speech difficulties. 2umerous etiologies can be responsible for this failure of normal speech production.Myoneurogenic problems can impair muscle control or affect muscle programming.Anatomic irregularities can present as a tissue deficit, structural problems that affect function, or even mechanical interference preventing normal closure.Mislearning comprises a host of etiologies whereby the patient has developed abnormal usage of the velopharyngeal mechanism despite the absence of other pathology. 3elopharyngeal dysfunction is a carefully chosen term that simply denotes the presence of incomplete velopharyngeal closure without making suggestions as to its cause.Use of this nomenclature has gained increasing favor by experts, replacing the previous designation, velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI).This helps to avoid confusion, as VPI has been differentially interpreted as denoting insufficiency, incompetence, and inadequacy-terms that may be similar, but are not synonymous and potentially implicate the cause of the dysfunction rather than describe the clinical finding.VPD is seen in roughly 20 to 30% of individuals who have undergone cleft palate repair, 4,5 and 5 to 10% of patients with a submucous cleft palate (SMCP). 6",

Aims A systematic exploration of circadian time patterns in individuals with schizophrenia with recurrent sleep disruption. Method We examined the relationship between sleep–wake activity, recorded actigraphically over 6 weeks, along with ambient light exposure and simultaneous circadian clock timing, by collecting weekly 48 h profiles of a urinary metabolite of melatonin in 20 out-patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy control individuals matched for age, gender and being unemployed. Results Significant sleep/circadian disruption occurred in all the participants with schizophrenia. Half these individuals showed severe circadian misalignment ranging from phase-advance/delay to non-24 h periods in sleep–wake and melatonin cycles, and the other half showed patterns from excessive sleep to highly irregular and fragmented sleep epochs but with normally timed melatonin production. Conclusions Severe circadian sleep/wake disruptions exist despite stability in mood, mental state and newer antipsychotic treatment. They cannot be explained by the individuals' level of everyday function.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade we have witnessed substantial progress towards the understanding of Parkinson's disease. According to pathological and neuroimaging studies, the traditional view of Parkinson's disease that begins with the development of motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, has begun to change. It is now understood that there would be a \"premotor\" or \"preclinical\" period in which the alphasynuclein pathology begins outside of the substantia nigra in the lower brainstem and autonomic nervous system. Although the pathophysiology of this phase is still unclear, it is currently thought that its symptoms would correspond to the so-called \"non-motor symptoms\". Hyposmia, depression, constipation and REM sleep disorders are one of the most relevant non-motor symptoms at this \"premotor\" stage. The spectrum of non-motor symptoms is very broad and covers the domains of neuropsychiatric, dysautonomic, gastrointestinal and sensory symptoms as well as sleep disorders. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, impulse control disorder, psychosis and dementia, are a major cause of disability as they are directly related to quality of life.",

Approximately 30% of these children have additional functional disabilities (syndromes). Today nearly 400 syndromes are known, and the most common combination of organ dysfunctions are ear and eye- deafblindness. Many deafblind syndromes have additional dysfunctions of the central nervous system (learning disabilities, delayed mental development etc). Since communication to a large extent is based on an intimate interaction between sight and hearing, this dual sensory loss can if not compensated give rise to severe sensory deprivation and communications problems. We will report results from cognitive studies in Usher and Alstrom syndrome and some clinical observations regarding CHARGE syndrome. The etiologies of deafblindness with additional cognitive dysfunctions have to be diagnosed very early in order to enhance basic communication skills and habilitation in children with deafblindness have to be enhance the use of multiple sensory capacities such as hearing, vision, tactile, smell, and taste. The importance of early and correct diagnoses for early intervention will be discussed.",

There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium.

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ASPM primary microcephaly (ASPM-MCPH) is characterized by: (1) significant microcephaly (below -3 SD for age) usually present at birth and always present before age one year and (2) the absence of other congenital anomalies. While developmental milestones are usually normal in young children, older children have variable levels of intellectual disability. Neurologic examination is usually normal except for mild spasticity. Seizures are not common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ASPM-MCPH is established in a proband with biallelic pathogenic variants in ASPM identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and focused on interventions to address developmental delay / intellectual disability, speech delay, and behavior issues. The management of epilepsy and spasticity is as per standard care. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of: growth; response of seizures to treatment or new-onset seizures; management of spasticity; developmental progress, including speech and language development; educational needs; and behavior for anxiety, attention, and aggressive or self-injurious behavior. Assess family need for social work support (e.g., respite care, other local resources) Agents/circumstances to avoid: Limit the use of methylphenidate, which exacerbates hyperactivity. Genetic counseling ASPM-MCPH is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a heterozygote (carrier), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes may have mild microcephaly (-2 to -3 SDs) but do not have other clinical findings associated with ASPM-MCPH. Once the ASPM pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Insufficient or disturbed sleep is strongly associated with adverse health conditions, including various neurodegenerative disorders. While the relationship between sleep and neurodegenerative disease is likely bidirectional, sleep disturbances often predate the onset of other hallmark clinical symptoms. Neuronal waste clearance is significantly more efficient during sleep; thus, disturbed sleep may lead to the accumulation of neuronal proteins that underlie neurodegenerative diseases. Key pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases include an accumulation of misfolded or misprocessed variants of amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, alpha synuclein (α-syn), and TarDNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43). While the presence of fibrillar protein aggregates of these neuronal proteins are characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases, the presence of small soluble toxic oligomeric variants of these different proteins likely precedes the formation of the hallmark aggregates.",

      "abstract": "The data concerning neurophysiological and neurotransmitter mechanisms of two principal kinds of inhibition of behavior is carried out: the inborn genetically determined inhibition and that developed in the course of training. On the basis of the experiments performed by the author and the literature on general neurophysiology the conclusion is made that development of inhibition of behavior during training (i.e. internal inhibition, including \"latent inhibition\") is determined by the relative strengthening of inhibitory hyperpolarization processes either locally (in a conditioned stimulus analyzer) or globally in the brain cortex and other brain structures during intensification of the inhibitory state (profound inhibition of a reflex and sleep). The main neurotransmitter in development of internal inhibition is gamma-aminobutyric acid. Inhibition of behavior without preliminary training arises either during the action of superstrong stimuli, (exceeding the maximum value inhibition) or during interaction of two and more active systems. A stronger one of these two systems suppresses another one (external inhibition, dominant inhibition, \"freezing\", \"prepulse inhibition\", etc.). These kinds of inhibition develop on the background of EEG activation, which suggests participation in their realization of reticular structures and corresponding neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, noradrenalin, dopamine and serotonin). Behavior pathology causes a break of the balanced interaction between the excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system. This affects both genetically determined forms of behavior inhibition and the learned internal inhibition.",

Since it is a complex phenomenon with several dimensions it is unlikely to be appropriately assessed by one single \"vigilance test\". One important dimension of vigilance discussed here is wakefulness with its counterpart of overt sleep and the whole spectrum of various levels in between. The transit zone between full wakefulness and overt sleep is mainly characterised by the subjective complaint of sleepiness, which cannot be measured directly. Only the consequences of reduced wakefulness such as a shortened sleep latency, slowed cognitive function and prolonged reaction time can be measured objectively. It is, therefore, more promising to combine a battery of subjective and objective tests to answer a specific question in order to achieve the most appropriate description for a given clinical or medicolegal situation. However even then we must keep in mind that many other important aspects of fitness to drive / fitness to work such as neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological functions including risk taking behaviour are not covered by vigilance tests. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach is essential in such situations.",

      "abstract": "Excessive sleepiness occurs frequently in the general population and is a common feature of many psychiatric conditions. The reductions in quality of life associated with excessive sleepiness may be substantial, involving compromised cognitive performance and work productivity as well as possible harm to the individual and the public. Excessive sleepiness may be the result of a number of extrinsic and intrinsic causes. Although it is an established symptom of certain psychiatric illnesses, abnormal excessive sleepiness in psychiatric patients may be the result of a comorbid disorder of sleep or wakefulness. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of sleep disorders are common in community psychiatric practices because clinicians may not be aware of the different causes and consequences of excessive sleepiness. It is essential to recognize and treat the underlying cause of this disorder. In cases where sleep disorders are suspected, a comprehensive treatment program might include nonpharmacologic approaches, pharmacologic approaches, or both may need to be initiated to encompass the complexity of sleep disorder treatments. Careful monitoring and follow-up of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, including counseling and long-term support, are essential to ensure treatment compliance and to maintain improvements over time.",

      "title": "1000 Hypnagogic hallucinations as a manifestation of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Narcolepsy and Parkinson’s disease (PD) share many similar symptoms. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep attacks, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, with or without cataplexy. Hypnagogic hallucinations occur while falling asleep and the person experiencing them typically knows they are not real. Here, we present a case of hypnagogic hallucinations as a manifestation of PD in a patient without narcolepsy. Report of case(s) A 66-year-old female with a history of tremor was seen in the sleep disorders clinic with chief complaints of dream enactment and excessive daytime sleepiness. She described bruising after falling out of bed. On further questioning, she reported instances of seeing “death and a grim reaper as well as a dark figure”, usually upon falling asleep at night. She denied daytime hallucinations. She underwent diagnostic polysomnography (PSG), which showed mild obstructive sleep apnea and loss of rapid eye movement (REM) atonia during brief periods of REM sleep. Treatment for dream enactment was implemented by increasing her dose of melatonin (which she had been taking for insomnia) and initiation of clonazepam, which led to significant improvement in dream enactment. Over the next two years, she was diagnosed with PD and started on carbidopa-levodopa. She reported more frequent hypnagogic hallucinations during a follow-up visit, occurring 1-2 times weekly, which her neurologist attributed to being on higher dosages of dopaminergic therapy. During a recent visit, she reported no dream enactment and infrequent hypnagogic hallucinations. Conclusion Sleep disturbances in PD are common and include insomnia, hypersomnia, and REM behavioral disorder (RBD). A lesser appreciated association is that between hypnagogic hallucinations and PD, as depicted in this case. Partial hypocretin cell loss in PD has been postulated to result in disturbed hypocretin signaling, which probably explains the occurrence of narcolepsy-like symptoms (including hypnagogic hallucinations) in PD. Hypnagogic hallucinations are more common among patients with PD compared to the general population and tend to occur more as PD progresses, with longer duration of treatment with dopaminergic agents, with older age, and in patients with RBD. This case serves as an important reminder that hypnagogic hallucinations are not pathognomonic for narcolepsy and are likely underappreciated in PD. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

This symptom may be broadly subdivided into primary (so-called 'idiopathic' or 'functional') constipation and secondary constipation; the latter is associated with endocrine, metabolic and neurological disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease), luminal obstruction (e.g., colon neoplasms) and use of drugs (e.g., anticholinergics and opioids) [1]. Here, we will focus on some known etiologic factors underlying primary constipation. The definition of constipation varies greatly according to the descriptor (layman, patient, physician, researcher), and several definitions are available in the literature; definitions not always overlapping. However, the two main aspects on which there is ample agreement is that constipation is characterized by a reduction (up to absence) of bowel movements and/or frequent (conventionally defined as at least a quarter of the occasions) difficult expulsion of stools (straining at stools) [1]. It is worth noting that these two aspects also broadly define the two main subtypes of chronic constipation, represented by slow-transit constipation (STC) and obstructed defecation (OD) [1].",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

      "title": "Sleep polysomnography as a predictor of recurrence in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "Adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) demonstrate certain sleep polysomnographic abnormalities, including sleep continuity disturbances, reduced slow-wave sleep, shortened rapid eye movement (REM) latency, and increased REM density. Findings of sleep EEG studies in depressed children and adolescents have yielded conflicting results, possibly because of methodological variations across the studies. Generally, however, studies have demonstrated that depressed children and adolescents exhibit less sleep continuity and non-REM sleep differences in comparison with control subjects than do adults. Thus, results from adult sleep polysomnography studies cannot necessarily be generalized to children and adolescents. Depressed adults who have reduced REM latency during the symptomatic episode appear more likely to have a relapse once treatment is discontinued than those with normal REM latency. No studies of the relationship between sleep polysomnographic variables and clinical course have been reported in depressed children and adolescents. Data for baseline clinical variables and 3 nights of sleep polysomnography were examined in 113 depressed children (≤ 12 yr; n = 51) and adolescents (≥ 13 yr; n = 62) (56 in-patients and 57 outpatients) where data was available on at least 1 yr of naturalistic follow-up. Subjects came from 2 studies of sleep polysomnography in children and adolescents with MDD. Clinical course was assessed using the Kiddie-Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation (K-LIFE). This interview was used to define recovery from the index episode of MDD and recurrence, a new episode of meeting full criteria for MDD. Clinically, within 1 yr of initial evaluation 102/113 subjects had recovered from their index episode of depression (minimal or no symptoms for 60 d). Of the 102 subjects who recovered, 36 (35.3%) had a recurrence of MDD. The majority of subjects (55%) who had a recurrence were not on medication at the time of recurrence. Subjects who had a recurrence were more likely to report suicidal thoughts or attempts at baseline compared to those without a recurrence (67 vs. 37%; F = 8.77; p = 0.004). On baseline sleep polysomnography, subjects with a later recurrence had decreased sleep efficiency and delayed sleep onset (sleep latency > 10 min). Probability of recurrence at 12 months was 0.39 compared to 0.15 in subjects with non-delayed sleep onset (p = 0.005). Baseline suicidal ideation and sleep dysregulation on sleep polysomnography predicted recurrence in a large sample of depressed children and adolescents. Depression in children and adolescents is frequently a chronic, recurrent illness. Factors that can predict clinical course are important in increasing our understanding of depression in this age group.",

      "title": "Acquired Aphasia, Dementia, and Behavior Disorder with Epilepsy and Continuous Spike and Waves During Sleep in a Child",
      "abstract": "Summary: Severe persistent neuropsychological disorders sometimes develop in the course of a focal epilepsy of unknown origin in previously normal children. Very frequent bilateral focal or generalized discharges are often noted on the sleep EEG records of these patients with no evidence of clinical seizures. The relation between these paroxysms and the observed deterioration remains unclear. We report a child with a partial complex epilepsy and severe disturbances of language, cognition, and behavior acquired in the early years of development who was followed for 15 years. A correlation between the evolution of the striking EEG abnormalities during sleep and the neuropsychological disorders could be established retrospectively. The observed sequence of onset and recovery of the aphasia, the dementia, and the “psychotic” behavior makes a direct causal relation between these deficits quite unlikely. Rather it suggests an association of independent symptoms with a specific language disorder becoming manifest in the course of the evolution. This child shows many of the main characteristics of the syndromes of “acquired aphasia with convulsive disorder” (Landau‐Kleffner syndrome) and “epilepsy with continuous spike and waves during sleep.” Both syndromes describe probably different facets of a similar underlying, still unexplained cerebral dysfunction. RÉSUMÉ Des troubles neuropsychologiques séverès et persistants peuvent survenir au cours ďune épilepsie focale ďétiologie inconnue chez des enfants auparavant normaux. Chez ces patients, on trouve souvent de très nombreuses décharges focales bilatéiales ou généralisées àľEEG de sommeil, sans crise clinique. La relation entre ces paroxysmes et la détérioration observée reste peu claire. Nous rapportons en détail le cas ďun enfant présentant une épilepsie partielle complexe et des troubles séverès du langage, des fonctions cognitives et du comportement acquis précocément au cours du développement, que nous avons suivi durant 15 ans. Une correlation entre ľévolution des anomalies EEG bilatérales durant le sommeil et des déficits neuropsychologiques a pûêtre établie rétrospectivement. Le mode de survenue et de récupération de ľaphasie, de la démence et du comportement “psychotique” rendent peu probable une relation causale entre ces déficits. II suggère plutôt une association de symptômes indepéndants avec un trouble spécifique du langage devenu prédominant au cours de ľévolution. Cet enfant présente la plupart des caractéristiques principales des syndromes ď“aphasie acquise avec épilepsie” et ď“épilepsie avec pointes‐ondes continues du sommeil.” Ces deux syndromes décrivent probablement des facettes différentes ďune même dysfonction cérébrale sous‐jacente dont la nature reste inexpliquée. RESUMEN En ocasiones, trastornos neuropsicológicos severos y persistentes surgen en el curso de una epilepsía focal de causa desconocida, en niños previamente normales. En estos pacientes, sin ataques clínicos, muy frecuentemente se registran descargas focales generalizadas que aparecen en los EEGs registrados durante el sueño. La relación entre estos paroxismos y el deterioro clínico permanece oscura. Se presenta un caso de un niño con epilepsía parcial compleja y severa alteración cognitiva, del lenguaje y del comportamiento que aparecieron en los años iniciales del desarrollo. Este nino ha sido seguido durante 15 afios. De modo retrospectivo fue posible establecer una correlación entra la evolución de las llamativas anomalías del EEG durante el sueño y los trastornos neuropsicológicos. La secuen‐ciaobservada entre el comienzo y la recuperación de la afasia, la dementia y el comportamiento “psicótico”, hace que una relción directa causal entre estos problemas sea muy improbable. Más bien sugiere una asociacíon de síntomas independientes con un trastorno específico del lenguaje que aparece en primer piano en el curso de la evolución. Este niño mostró muchas de las características principales de los síndromes “afasia adquirida con trastornos convulsivos (síndrome de Landau‐Kleffner)” y “epilepsía con continuas complejos punta‐onda durante el sueño”. Ambos síndromes probablemente describen diferentes facetas de una disfunción cerebral subyacente todavía inexplicada. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Gelegentlich entwickeln sich bei vormals normalen Kindern im Verlauf einer fokalen Epilepsie unklarer Ätiologie schwere persistierende neuropsychologische Störungen. Bei solchen Patienten werden häufig zahlreiche bilateral fokale oder generalisierte Entladungen im Schlaf‐EEG ohne klinische Anfälle gefunden. Die Beziehung zwischen den Paroxysmen und der beobachteten mentalen Verschlechterung bleibt unklar, Wir berichten über ein Kind mit einer partiell komplexen Epilepsie und schweren Störungen der Sprache, der kognitiven Fähigkeiten und des Verhaltens, die in frühen Jahren erworben wurden. Das Kind wurde über 15 Jahre lang weiter verfolgt. Rückblickend kann eine Korrelation zwischen der Entwicklung den EEG‐Auffälligkeiten wahrend des Schlafs und den neuropsychologischen Störungen hergestellt werden. Die beobachtete Folge im Auftreten und Wiederrückbildung der Aphasie, der Demenz und der “psychotischen” Verhaltensstörungen macht eine direkte kausale Beziehung zwischen diesen Defiziten unwahrscheinlich. Sie legt vielmehr eine Assoziation unabhängiger Symptome mit einer spezifischen Sprachstörung nahe, die im Laufe der Entwicklung in den Vordergrund tritt. Das Kind zeigt viele der Hauptcharakteristika des Syndroms der “erworbenen Aphasie mit Anfallserkrankung” (Landau‐Kleffner‐Syndrom) und der “Epilepsie mit kontinuierlichen Spike Wave Entladungen während des Schlafs”. Beide Syndrome beschreiben wahrscheinlich verschiedene Facetten einer ähnlichen bis jetzt ungeklärten zerebralen Stöning.",

The clinician's first task is to separate sleep problems originating in the physiologic changes of aging from those originating in pathological processes. Normal elderly persons have greater difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, compared with younger persons, and sleep is qualitatively more shallow with more involuntary movements and abnormal breathing. Sleep complaints reach a pathological level as elders begin to experience deterioration of function during their period of normal wakefulness, manifested as excessive sleepiness, concentration deficits, and mood changes, or the emergence of bizarre or dangerous behavior during sleep. Sleep disorders are associated with excess physical and psychiatric morbidity and are treatable. An approach focused on sleep-related syndromes is a useful basis for rational treatment, and the treatment of many sleep disorders can be provided without expensive sleep laboratory testing.",

Meanwhile, constipation, including symptoms of evacuation difficulty and/or fewer bowel movements, is a common problem as people age. Risk factors include problems in cognition, mobility, gastrointestinal motility, dysautonomia, anorectal dysfunction, and disabling neurologic disorders. Faecal incontinence is more common in frail individuals but is often assessed inadequately. The cause is often multifactorial. Treatment depends on the cause: a combination of approaches may be necessary, including avoidance of faecal impaction, instigation of a structured bowel care plan including regular prompted toileting, dietary modification, and (in some cases) use of loperamide or similar medications.",

Sleep is an important part of physiologic, emotional, and neurocognitive development. Sleep in children is an important and dynamic process, affecting numerous aspects of health and development. Problems with sleep are relatively common but often can be challenging to recognize and hence are very often missed. At every general checkup, parents should be asked whether they have any sleep concerns, whether their child snores, and whether their child wakes up appearing rested. A few key interventions (especially sleep hygiene) can effectively be implemented in general pediatric practice, and more complex issues should be referred to a sleep specialist. Thus, the aim of this article is to sensitize the practitioner in sleep medicine and provide an overview of sleep in children, including important aspects of sleep-related physiology, key relationships between sleep and growth and development, and the most prevalent sleep disorders that pediatricians are likely to encounter.",

Factors like elevated stress and poor sleep hygiene are some of the primary culprits behind this, and the consequences they can have on patients’ health are hard to overstate. Insufficient sleep has been documented to have adverse long-term effects on patients’ cardiovascular health, immune systems, and mental well-being, among many other facets of health. Given this, patients with insomnia are at significantly elevated risk of developing these negative health outcomes over time. Insomnia is defined as difficulty with sleep onset or maintenance with associated daytime deficiencies, such as poor concentration. In Ireland, it has been estimated that up to 15% of the population struggle with this potentially debilitating disorder, surpassing some other European populations. Further complicating things, the management of this disorder can be quite difficult and inconsistent. The pharmacological options we currently have at our disposal tend to either have limited efficacy, like melatonin receptor agonists, or carry the risk of dependence, such as benzodiazepines. As for non-pharmacological therapies, our options are extremely lacking, with cognitive behavioural therapy being the only such treatment currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",

      "title": "Sleep and Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Sleep problems and fatigue are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The etiology of these disturbances is multifactorial. Sleep disturbance and fatigue after TBI can be a result of the trauma itself or can be secondary to medical problems, pain, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and/or side effects of medications. Because sleep disturbance is common in the general population, the clinician needs to differentiate between premorbid sleep problems and those that are temporally related to TBI. The complex relationship between sleep and TBI can be understood as a series of mutually independent processes. First, acute brain injury can lead to disrupted levels of consciousness and a disrupted sleep process. A second and distinct type of sleep disruption often develops in the chronic phase of recovery; during this phase, severity of injury is often another factor that influences the type and nature of sleep problems experienced by patients. Finally, subjective and objective measures of sleep disturbance may be discordant, in that subjective complaints may occur without objective evidence, and vice versa (Orff et al. 2009). The relationship between sleep disturbances and psychiatric disorders is also complex. The neural mechanisms that mediate sleep also have a role in the regulation and stabilization of mood. Dysfunction of these neural circuits after TBI can, therefore, cause both mood and sleep problems. In addition, psychotropics can exacerbate sleep problems, and sleep disturbances can precipitate psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety and dysphoria. Fatigue is a nonspecific and highly subjective symptom that is often reported in patients with TBI. It is described as a feeling of exhaustion, tiredness, or weakness. In many ways, sleep disturbances after TBI are better defined and understood than symptoms of fatigue. Therefore, in this chapter, we first discuss the normal sleep cycle, and then the prevalence, pathophysiology, and types of posttraumatic sleep dis-orders, followed by the evaluation and treatment of these sleep dis-turbances. We then focus on fatigue after TBI. Although sleep disturbances and fatigue overlap, we treat them as separate entities, for clarity. We briefly review the literature and make practical suggestions for the management of sleep and fatigue following TBI. A more detailed description of TBI sleep disturbances can be found in the chapter \"Fatigue and Sleep Problems\" in the Textbook of Traumatic Brain Injury (Rao et al. 2005).",

The treatment of sleep apnea syndrome is particularly important in managing patients with cerebral infarction of whom 50-80% have moderate to severe sleep apnea. Sleep apnea produces not only poor quality sleep but also excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue and lack of energy. Sleep problems frequently found in patients with dementia are sleep-wake cycle abnormality, fragmentation of sleep, nocturnal insomnia, decreased slow wave sleep and REM sleep, and sleep disordered breathing. The management of sleep disturbances is very important for controlling symptoms such as nocturnal wandering and sundowning syndrome in patients with dementia.

SJ is associated with evening chronotype and poor mental health, but mechanisms supporting this link remain unknown. Impaired ability to retrieve extinction memory is an emotion regulatory deficit observed in some psychiatric illnesses. Thus, SJ-dependent extinction memory deficits may provide a mechanism for poor mental health. To test this, healthy male college students completed 7–9 nights of actigraphy, sleep questionnaires, and a fear conditioning and extinction protocol. As expected, greater SJ, but not total sleep time discrepancy, was associated with poorer extinction memory. Unexpectedly, greater SJ was associated with a tendency toward morning rather than evening chronotype. These findings suggest that deficient extinction memory represents a potential mechanism linking SJ to psychopathology and that SJ is particularly problematic for college students with a greater tendency toward a morning chronotype.",

The causes of SWDs in TBI are multifactorial (eg, depression, anxiety, stress, medication-related, pain, genetic background, and possibly trauma-induced brain damage).

In some cases, it presents as a subclinical symptom or experience, and in other cases it presents as an acute or chronic insomnia disorder. The definitions and diagnostic criteria of insomnia are reviewed, and endotypes/subtypes of insomnia are discussed. Risk factors for insomnia are discussed, including demographics and other factors. Models of insomnia etiology and pathophysiology are reviewed, with a focus on the 3P model and its variants. Pathophysiology of insomnia is discussed in the context of hyperarousal mechanisms, polysomnographic features, neurophysiological correlates, and genetic factors. Consequences of insomnia are reviewed, including psychological, neurological, and health-related outcomes. Finally, treatment modalities are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "(1) There are cases of acute excitement that are classified under several headings with apparently no recognition as to the uniformity of symptomatology. These cases have been diagnosed as Bell's Mania, typhomania, acute delirious mania (manic-depressive psychosis), delirium grave, acute delirium, specific febrile delirium, and collapse delirium. (2) Luther Bell described these cases in 1849 and the description is slightly modified as follows: There is a sudden onset; exceedingly great overactivity; marked sleeplessness; great push of speech with statements that are disconnected at times by reason of the rapidity of flow; disconnected and poorly systematized delusions; transient hallucinations that border on illusions; appearance of confusion, but when one insists that the patient answer the questions, the patient can \"suspend the intellectual wanderings\" long enough to answer correctly as to orientation. The course of the illness is from three to six weeks, with a fatal termination in a large percentage of cases, apparently from cardio-vascular failure due to overactivity. The cases that recover have no after symptoms. No pathological evidence of note has been found by later workers. (3) Treatment is recommended in the form of sufficient sedative, regardless of the dosage, to enable the patient to get some rest. In our case ordinary sedatives failed and though over 125 grains of sodium amytal were given in three days the patient slept comparatively little. However, the overexcitement was quelled. (4) For the sake of clarity in the studying of this group, and until more definite findfngs are brought forth, it is suggested that these cases be called Bell's Mania, after the original observer.",

      "title": "Manifestations of cerebral dysfunction in infancy and their association with toxaemia and antepartum haemorrhage. A cohort study.",
      "abstract": "The delayed consequences of fetal and neonatal pathology are much more difficult to measure than their immediate influence on mortality. Those who die in late infancy or early childhood and, poten tially, those whose congenital handicap is an anato mical one visible at, or soon after, birth are count able. However, many other congenital disorders (for example, cerebral palsy and deafness) cannot be diagnosed in early infancy. The supposition that toxaemia or antepartum haemorrhage may be either major or contributory causes of neurological and behavioural disorders in childhood derives principally from the knowledge that perinatal mortality is high in both those maternal conditions. As yet, however, the mechanism of death is not fully understood (Buck, 1967; Baird and Thomson, 1969), although the presence of prematurity may well be a factor in some cases. Among infants surviving a toxaemic pregnancy there is certainly thought to be a possibility of residual damage, particularly to the central nervous system. The studies of Lilienfeld and Pasamanick (1954) and of Lilienfeld, Pasamanick, and Rogers (1955) in Baltimore and New York State, based upon careful retrospective comparisons of brain-damaged and normal children, implicate a number of obstetric complications?in particular, toxaemia and ante partum haemorrhage (Pasamanick and Knobloch, 1959). It is not yet certain, however, whether either of these complications exerts its effect in the absence of prematurity or of the other complications of pregnancy or labour with which they are frequently associated. Existing evidence in favour of an association between childhood neuropsychiatric disorder and toxaemia or antepartum haemorrhage derives almost entirely from case history studies. In such studies 'brain-damaged' children are categorized by their similarity in respect of several simultaneously presenting manifestations of illness, and then a history is taken of their frequency of exposure to toxaemia and antepartum haemorrhage. A com parable group of children without the disease is studied in a similar way. However, setting limits of a disease entity such as brain damage on a mani festational basis is a highly complex and, in part, an intuitive procedure, and from the outset con siderable confusion has resulted from the use of this term. In particular, there is little doubt that brain damage is much more likely to be diagnosed among infants who are found to have a history of an abnormal pregnancy or birth than among those who have not (Birch, 1964), thus condemning the findings of retrospective (case history) studies. The study reported in this paper has attempted to avoid this dilemma by following up a cohort of infants, who experienced toxaemia or antepartum haemorrhage during pregnancy, until they were 12 months old, at which time a detailed developmental and neurological examination was undertaken together with a similar examination of an equal number of matched controls. The examination was undertaken 'blind', i.e., the identity of the subjects (cases and controls) was not known to the examiner.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose of Review: Sleep-wake disorders occur in 10% to 28% of children and differ somewhat in pathophysiology and management from sleep-wake disorders in adults. This article discusses the diagnosis and management of key childhood sleep disorders. Recent Findings: The role of sleep in memory consolidation and in the facilitation of learning has been increasingly recognized, even at the toddler stage. Cataplexy, a key feature of narcolepsy type 1, may be subtle in childhood and characterized by transient muscle weakness isolated to the face. Children with obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome display prominent neurobehavioral symptoms such as daytime inattentiveness and hyperactivity, so it is important to elicit a sleep history when these symptoms are encountered. Systemic iron deficiency occurs in about two-thirds of children with restless legs syndrome and is easily treatable. Parasomnias arising out of non–rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, such as confusional arousals and sleepwalking, may be difficult to distinguish from nocturnal seizures, and, in many cases, video-EEG polysomnography is required to differentiate between causes. Summary: Clinicians should routinely integrate the assessment of sleep-wake function into their practices of neurology and child neurology because of the opportunity to improve the quality of life of their patients.",

      "abstract": "Epileptic seizure is symptom of acute diseases (provoked seizure with known cause) or epilepsy (unprovoked epileptic seizure with no irritated factor). For establishment of seizure type a precise anamnesis is necessary and an EEG (video-polygraphy when awake, during sleep, after deprivation, with photostimulation, hyperventilation). Normal EEG, as well as an abnormal EEG with a positive family history of epilepsy does not confirm epileptic seizure. With clinical evaluation of the first unprovoked or repeated epileptic seizure, the exact classification of seizure, epilepsy or syndrome will be established. A non-provoked epileptic seizure will be repeated in 14-65% children in one year. In children with idiopathic/cryptogenic seizures the risk for repetition is 30-50% and in children with symptomatic cause the risk is higher than 50% in a 2 year period from the unprovoked seizure. About 46% of children followed-up over 10yrs had one or more epileptic seizures after the first unprovoked seizure. According to the literature data, even prolonged seizures rarely cause brain damage in children, except in connection with acute neurological disturbances. One of the reasons for starting antiepileptic therapy (AET) is the fear of injury or death during the next seizure. To lessen the cause of injury, it is necessary to reduce all possible risks during the daytime. Sudden death in children with epilepsy is a rarity and is connected to some kind of neurological damage. There is no study with a description of a lesser risk of injury or sudden death in children with AET introduced after the first unprovoked seizure. According to two studies of class II and four studies of class III according to EB criteria, there is no difference in terms of the chance of repeated seizure in children with AET and those without AET. The decision about introducing AET or not, in children or adolescents after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure should be based on the possibility of repeated epileptic seizures and the danger of permanent AET that can influence the child’s cognitive development, behaviour, physical and psychosocial development. The decision should be evaluated individually for each child taking into account the medical reasons together with the decisions of the patients and family. Recommendations after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure: AET is not indicated for prevention of development of epilepsy (level B); 2. Treatment with AET should be considered as a possibility of preventing the next seizure and the risk of pharmacological and psychosocial side-effects (level B). At first, in a child with the first epileptic seizure, all gathered data, clinical features and findings should be considered together with a detailed clinical evaluation, instead of immediate initiation of AET treatment.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Insomnia is common among the elderly. The use of hypnotic drugs in elderly patients is frequently criticized owing to dependency, cognitive impairments, falls and withdrawal effects. The production of melatonin, a physiological sleep and circadian rhythm regulator, declines with age. Prolonged-release melatonin (Circadin®), designed to mimic the endogenous pattern of melatonin production, is licensed for insomnia in patients aged ≥ 55 years. Areas covered: This review summarizes published studies on Circadin's efficacy and safety (Summary of Product Characteristics and Medline search on 'Circadin' and 'insomnia'). Expert opinion: The main significant and clinically relevant benefits are improvements in sleep quality and latency, next-day morning alertness and quality of life. The responses may develop over several days. An oral 2-mg dose once daily, for 3 months, has generally been well tolerated with no rebound, withdrawal or 'hangover' effects and no safety concerns on concomitant therapy with antihypertensive, antidiabetic, lipid-lowering or anti-inflammatory drugs. Untoward effects of hypnotics on cognition, memory, postural stability and sleep structure are not seen with Circadin. Given as a first-line prescription, with 13 weeks' posology and the lack of rebound effects, Circadin has the potential to improve quality of life in insomnia patients aged 55 years and older and avoid long-term use of hypnotics.",

Cases were divided into four eizure types: infantile spasms; status epilep‐ticus; and “others” (patients without spasms or status), generalized and partial. Mortality was studied in 334 cases, mental and neurological prognosis in 313 infants followed 1 year or more. Globally the prognosis was very poor even outside cases of infantile spasms. Mortality was higher and mental and neurological sequelae were more common in symptomatic than in cryptogenic cases. The highest mortality and greatest number of neurological defects were in status epilepticus and in “others” partial groups. Severely retarded subjects were more common in infantile spasms and “others” partial. The proportion of mentally normal patients, however, was no different according to ictal type. Mental and neurological prognosis was less unfavorable when the first seizure occurred at or over 6 months. A family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions (21% of the cases in the whole series) was more common in the “others” subgroups, especially in the cryptogenic “others” (429c). The less unfavorable outcome obtained in cryptogenic “others” generalized with a positive family history.

Los retrasos mentales severos fueron más frecuentes en los espasmos infantiles y en los “otros” ataques parciales pero la proporción été enfermos mentales normales no fue influenciada por el tipo été ataques. El pronéstico mental y neurológico fue menos sombrio cuando el primer ataque ocurri6 a partir été los 6 meses été edad. La historia familiar été epilepsia o été ataques febriles (21% en las series tota‐les) fué m&amp;s comun en el subgrupo été“otros” ataques y especialmente en los criptogenicos (42%). La evolu‐ción menos sombria se observo en el grupo criptogenico été“otros” ataques generalizados con historia familiar positiva. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Mortalität, neurologische Folgen und geistige Entwicklung wurden bei Kindern untersucht, die vom 28. Lebenstag bis zum Ende des ersten Jahres afebrile Krämpfe hatten, die nicht Folge einer akuten postna‐talen Schädigung waren. 4 Anfallsmanifestationen wurden unterschieden: “Infantile Spasms,” Status Epilepticus, “andere” (außer den vorgenannten) mit generalisierten bzw. partialen Anfällen. Die Mortalitat wurde bei 334 Patienten untersucht, die geistige und neurologische Prognose bei 313 Kindern ein oder mehrere Jahre verfolgt. Global war die Prognose sehr schlecht sogar wenn man Fälle mit Infantile Spasms unberiicksichtigt läßt. Die Mortalitat war höher, geistige und neurologische Residuen traten häufiger bei symptomatischen als bei kryptogenen Fällen auf. Die höchste Mortalität und die größte Zahl neuro‐logischer Defekte fand man beim Status Epilepticus und bei “anderen” Gruppen mit Partialanfallen. Schwer retardierte Patienten waren häufiger in der Gruppe der jenigen zu finden, die Infantile Spasms und “andere” Partialanfälle boten; aber der Prozent‐satz der geistig altersgemäßen Patienten differierte nicht in Abhängigkeit vom Anfallstyp. Die geistige und neurologische Prognose war ungünstiger, wenn die ersten Anfälle mit oder nach 6 Monaten auftraten. Eine positive familiare Belastung mit épilepsie oder Fieberkrampfen (21% der Fälle der gesamten Serie) fand sich häufiger in den Untergruppen mit “anderen” Anfällen, besonders bei den Patienten mit “anderen” kryptogenen Anfällen (42%). Am besten schnitten von den “anderen” kryptogenen Patienten die mit generalisierten Anfallen und einer positiven Familien‐anamnese ab.",

      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

In recent studies prevalence is at least 17% in primary care. Somatoform complaints (e.g. headache with 38.7%) or non-specific common symptoms (e.g. feeling of inner restlessness with 41.3%) are much more widespread. Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

It is known that sleep can facilitate epileptic activity and that seizures in sleep tend to occur during specific sleep stages. Certain epilepsy syndromes have a well-documented and strong association with sleepand these can present with a variety of bizarre behaviors and motor activity. Disorders that may present with nocturnal nonepileptic paroxysmal events may include not only sleep-related disorders per se but also psychiatric/behavioral conditions\"benign\" paroxysmal phenomena with unrelated etiology, and nonneurologic disorders. These phenomena, especially when involving complex motor activity, such as that observed in parasomnias, nocturnal panic attacks, and rapid eye movement behavior disorders may be difficult to differentiate from seizures. Moreover, there is increasing awareness that certain sleep disorders, such as sleep-disordered breathing, may coexist with epilepsy. There are several clinical and electrographical features that allow an accurate diagnosis, and diagnostic tools such as video-EEG polysomnography may be essential.",

The symptoms must persist for at least one month. Many children with SM also have excessive shyness, poor eye contact, and fear of embarrassment. Despite the failure to speak, the child’s nonverbal communication ability is typically age appropriate and prosocial nonverbal communication such as nodding or giggling is often observed. Since SM frequently co-occurs with other communication disorders, the assessment should include a hearing and speech and language evaluation. Behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are the primary treatments for SM. Medications are most effective when combined with behavioral treatments and may include the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).",

Therefore in clinical practice simultaneous complaints of „not enough“ and „too much“ sleep are very frequent. For the investigation and treatment of organic sleep disorders, available instruments, guidelines and specialised institutions (sleep centres or sleep laboratories) are more advanced than for non-organic sleep disorders. Especially in the child and adolescent psychiatric and psychotherapeutic field this complicates an appropriate treatment. In addition multiple psychiatric, neurological and other somatic diseases can disrupt nighttime sleep and cause impairments during the day too. There are various instruments and methods to cover disturbed nocturnal sleep, some of which have already found widespread use in clinical practice (e. g. sleep diaries or specific questionnaires and interviews). For the examination of daytime sleepiness instruments and methods are available too, which by now seem to be less widely used. Against this background an overview of definitions, distinctive features and clinical instruments as well as guidelines for dealing with “too much and too little sleep” during the day or at night shall be presented.",

      "title": "[Causes, diagnosis and treatment of neurogenic dysphagia as an interdisciplinary clinical problem].",
      "abstract": "The intricate mechanism of swallowing can be divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Dysphagia is a disruption in the swallowing process, which include difficulty in transporting (or a lack of transporting) a food or liquid bolus from the mouth through the pharynx and esophagus into the stomach. Causes of disruptions in the swallowing process can be divided into superior (oropharyngeal) and inferior (esophageal) according to Paradowski et al. Neurlologic dysphagia may be caused by a disruption in different parts of the central nervous system (supranuclear level, level of motor and sensory nuclei taking part in swallowing process, peripherial nerves level and a pathology of muscle cells and spindles) or neuromuscular and muscular disorders. Neuromuscular disorders causes according to Waśko-Czopnik et al. are: stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, bulbar and pseudobulbar paralysis, neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis), tabes dorsalis, multisystem degenerations, Parkinson's disease, delayed dyskineses, Huntington's disease, myasthenia and myasthenic syndromes, myopathies and peripherial neuropathies. The correct diagnosis evaluation include history taking, physical examination with palpation and consultations (laryngological, gastrological and neurological). According to Halama radiological esophagogram, videofluoroscopy, flexible endoscopic examination, ultrasound examination, manometry, electromyography, scintigraphy and 24 hour pH monitoring are main diagnostic procedures of dysphagia. Some of the reasons for the neurologic dysphagia may be treated by surgical and pharmacological methods. Neurologic dysphagia rehabilitation is difficult, long-lasting and often falling far short of expected results. Primary it should include neurologic cause treatment if it is possible. According to WHO International Classification of Functioning and Health in 2001 non-invasive methods of dysphagia treatment may be divided into reconstitution, compensatory and adaptive techniques. The most popular reconstitution methods are thermal stimulation (Lazzar's) or tactilethermal application (Rosenbeck's) techniques which may be applied for abnormal duration of stage transition (DST). Abnormal duration of stage transition considerably increase probability of aspiration. Dysphagia treatment by compensatory methods consist in various techniques of swallowing and posture changes application. Adaptive techniques include dietary changes--avoiding of sustenances strengthening dysphagia and adequate dietary intake. The basic principle of dysphagia rehabilitation is that the most effective way to regain efficiency is the regeneration on remains of lost function. Carrying out imperfect swallowing acts is probably the best way of increasing effectiveness and efficiency of swallowing. On the other hand imperfect swallowing acts may be hazardous because of the danger of aspiration and inhalation pneumonia.",

Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour.

      "title": "Estudio de la eficacia de un tratamiento psicológico breve en la disminución de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "El trastorno de panico se define como un trastorno en el que los ataques de panico presentan de forma inesperada y recurrente y al menos uno de ellos va seguido de un minimo de un mes de inquietud o preocupacion persistente por la aparicion de nuevas crisis o sus consecuencias, y/o por un cambio significativo y desadaptativo en el comportamiento que se relaciona con los ataques de panico. El ataque de panico se describe como la aparicion subita de miedo y/o malestar intensos que alcanza su maxima expresion en minutos y han de presentarse al menos cuatro de los trece sintomas fisiologicos y cognitivos descritos (APA, 2013).\nEn terminos generales se estima la prevalencia anual en Estados Unidos y varios paises europeos en torno al 2-3% en los adultos y adolescentes (APA, 2013). \nEl trastorno de panico conlleva un alto grado de deterioro de la calidad de vida e insatisfaccion (Comer et al., 2011; Barrera y Norton, 2009), mayor probabilidad de intentos de suicidio y suicidio consumado (Nepon et al., 2010), aumento de disfuncion cognitiva y emocional (Deckersbach et al., 2011), asi como con costes economicos y sociales sustanciales (Batelaan et al., 2007; de Graaf, Tuithof y van Dorsselaer 2012).\nLa terapia cognitivo-conductual ha sido ampliamente estudiada y es un tratamiento psicologico eficaz para el trastorno de panico (Hoffart et al., 2016; Kaczkurkin y Foa, 2015; Porter y Chambless, 2015; Sanchez-Meca et al., 2010; Arch y Craske, 2009; Hoffmann y Smits, 2008). La duracion promedio del tratamiento es de 12 a 15 sesiones, pero incluso los tratamientos mas breves han demostrado ser eficaces siempre que estos tratamientos mantengan los elementos centrales de la intervencion estandar (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Las dos formas principales de terapia cognitivo conductual desarrolladas para el trastorno de panico han sido el tratamiento de control de panico del grupo de Barlow (Barlow y Cerny, 1998; Barlow y Craske, 2000) y la terapia cognitiva del grupo de Clark (Clark y Salkovskis, 1989). Ambos tratamientos incluyen los componentes de psicoeducacion acerca del panico, reestructuracion cognitiva, la exposicion a las sensaciones corporales interoceptivas temidas y exposicion en vivo a situaciones temidas, pero dando mayor peso a la exposicion el grupo de Barlow y al componente cognitivo el grupo de Clark.\nAunque el tratamiento para el trastorno de panico ha demostrado un exito significativo, hay mucho margen de mejora, las tasas de respuesta inadecuada al tratamiento (Smits et al., 2012; Frentz et al., 2014; Gloster et al., 2015; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004) y la necesidad de tratamiento adicional permanecen altas (Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, Eifert, y Craske, 2012; Casey et al., 2004; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014; Landon y Barlow, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014). Por lo tanto, sigue habiendo una clara necesidad de nuevas estrategias terapeuticas, combinaciones de las ya existentes o bien, personalizar el tratamiento segun las caracteristicas del paciente, para aumentar las tasas de respuesta al tratamiento, especialmente entre pacientes refractarios.\nSi bien hay muchos tratamientos cognitivo-conductuales bien establecidos para los trastornos de ansiedad y el panico, la investigacion centrada en la mejora de los factores de riesgo permanece aun en una etapa incipiente (Feldner, Zvolensky y Schmidt, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2007; Schmidt y Keough, 2010). En los ultimos anos se ha ido abriendo paso el interes por el estudio de los factores de riesgo para el panico asi como el desarrollo de intervenciones eficaces para el tratamiento de los mismos (Zvolensky, Schmidt, Bernstein y Keough, 2006). En el caso del trastorno de panico, se sabe que un factor de riesgo cognitivo es la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y que es una variable de diferencias individuales bien establecida que refleja una tendencia estable a temer las sensaciones corporales asociadas con la excitacion ansiosa (Reiss y McNally, 1985). \nPor otro lado, pese a contar con un gran numero de estudios donde se demuestra la eficacia de las terapias cognitivo-conductuales para el panico, estos se basan en paquetes terapeuticos que constan habitualmente de unas 12-15 sesiones (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Recientemente han adquirido especial enfasis los estudios de programas de tratamiento mas breves y facilmente aplicables en los servicios de Salud Mental a los que puedan acceder un mayor numero de pacientes (Deacon y Abramowitz, 2006; McHugth, Smits y Otto, 2009; Keough y Schmidt, 2014).\nHasta la fecha, la mayor intervencion centrada en la reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad se ha llevado a cabo por Schmidt et al. (2007) y Schmidt y Keough (2010). Ha sido realizada sobre individuos no clinicos con alto indice de sensibilidad a la ansiedad mediante los programas ASAT (Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Training) y el protocolo revisado ASERT (Anxiety Sensitivity Education and Reduction Training), consiguiendose una reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad cercana del 60% en un mes de seguimiento comparado con un grupo control (Keough y Schmidt, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014). \nEn nuestro pais no contamos con estudios donde se evalue la eficacia de tratamientos breves que tengan como diana terapeutica la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad aplicados en el entorno de un Centro de Salud Mental, sobre muestras clinicas.\nEl presente estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar la eficacia en la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad de un tratamiento breve (una sesion) con dos componentes (psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva) en pacientes con trastorno de panico con o sin agorafobia. Para ello se realizo un diseno cuasi-experimental de dos grupos de pacientes adultos (edad 18-65 anos) del Centro de Salud Mental de Pontones (Madrid) con trastorno de panico. El grupo experimental lo formaron 37 pacientes y el grupo control 39, con medidas pre, postratamiento y de seguimiento al mes y a los tres meses tras el tratamiento, a los cuales, al grupo experimental se le aplico un tratamiento basado en psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva y al grupo control, un tratamiento-placebo basado en psicoeducacion general para la salud. A los pacientes se les administro en cada momento de la evaluacion el Indice de Sensibilidad a la Ansiedad que evalua el miedo a los sintomas fisiologicos, cognitivos y sociales de la ansiedad; la subescala Rasgo del Inventario de Ansiedad Estado-Rasgo que evalua un factor que comprenderia las diferencias individuales, relativamente estables, para responder ante situaciones percibidas como amenazantes con un aumento en la ansiedad (ansiedad rasgo) y la Escala de Inadaptacion que evalua en que medida el trastorno de panico afecta a diferentes areas de la vida cotidiana del sujeto como trabajo, vida social, tiempo libre, relacion de pareja y convivencia familiar, junto con una valoracion global\nLos resultados indicaron que el tratamiento basado el psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva disminuyo significativamente los niveles de sensibilidad a la ansiedad asi como la interferencia que el trastorno de panico producia en la vida de los sujetos, efectos, ambos, que el tratamiento-placebo no logro. Se observo tambien que el tratamiento experimental, asi como el control-placebo, no lograron cambios significativos en la variable ansiedad-rasgo. Los cambios observados aumentaron en el seguimiento.\nSe puede concluir que el tratamiento compuesto por psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva se muestra eficaz para disminuir la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y el grado de interferencia que el trastorno de panico produce en la vida de los pacientes y que el tamano del efecto del tratamiento es grande y se incrementa con el paso del tiempo. La sensibilidad a la ansiedad como diatesis cognitiva para el trastorno de panico se ha mostrado como una diana terapeutica maleable en los pacientes con trastorno de panico. Sin embargo, el tratamiento experimental no se ha mostrado eficaz para disminuir la variable ansiedad-rasgo.",

Sleeplessness has been linked with several health problems from including diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. Sleeplessness also leads to decreased work performance, traffic accidents, mood and relationship problems, and countless other issues. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine. International Classification of Sleep Disorders lists 7 broad categories of sleep disorders: insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnia, sleep-related movement disorders, and other sleep disorders. This article will focus on circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.",

      "abstract": "Insomniacs generally report not only sleep-related symptoms such as difficulty in initiating, maintaining, obtaining sufficient restorative sleep, but also experience various daytime impairment reflective of sleep deficits. Although pathophysiology of insomnia remains to be explored, physiological hyperarousal evidenced by cognitive, endocrine, and neurophysiologic variables has been revealed to be involved in onset and development of insomnia. Patients with insomnia also suffer from cognitive impairment. Characteristically, they report their sleep and psychoperformance to be worse than are objectively measured. This \"perceived\" deficit is exactly what aggravates the QOL of insomniac patients and let them fall in a vicious cycle. Insomnia is often induced by stress events, and is assumed to develop by 3Ps, predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors. Concept and diagnostic criterion of insomnia are still fluctuating. There is a need for clarification of pathophysiology of insomnia for development of efficient treatment skills and critical prevention of chronic insomnia.",

      "title": "Sleep and Daytime Functioning in Children on the Fetal Alcohol and Autism Spectrums",
      "abstract": "Autism and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions that affect at least 3% of the school aged population. Both have serious secondary sequelae including anxiety and depression, problems with concentration in class, learning new concepts through relevant curriculums, and social communication. Sleep is crucial to healthy neurodevelopment. It is not just a period of rest, but a time when the brain is highly active. During sleep, the brain consolidates newly acquired information, organises memory, and can lay the basis for emotional memory. Within Autism and FASD (as well as in many other developmental and psychological conditions), sleep quality and quantity remain much lower than the average and necessary amount. It is not known why this is, but research suggests that there is a complex and bidirectional relationship between sleep and development. This relationship may be part of the compromise of atypical development. This thesis links sleep with a number of daytime outcomes in children with Autism and FASD. According to the research carried out as part of this thesis, sleep is connected to anxiety, behaviours such as aggression and withdrawal, cognitive aspects such attention and working memory, as well as social and environmental factors. This is apparent not only in children in the neurodevelopmental categories, but in typically developing children too. This research also finds that children with Autism and FASD experience more sleep problems than typically developing children. It is therefore proposed here that sleep health interventions should be strongly considered as part of the therapeutic practice for children with Autism and FASD.",

The prevalence of PD increases with increasing age and in the UK is ∼150 per 100 000 population with incidence of 10.8 cases of PD per 100 000 population. The mean age of onset of PD is in the seventies. The diagnosis of PD is based on the presence of bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes all of which are likely to be asymmetrical. It is now recognised that PD is much more than a motor disorder, having a spectrum of non-motor symptoms, which may occur prior to the onset of the motor signs. The non-motor symptoms of PD may have more impact on long term quality of life compared with the motor symptoms1. Non motor symptoms include autonomic impairment (eg constipation, sweating, urinary problems, dribbling and dysphagia) psychiatric problems (eg depression, dementia, psychosis), sleep disturbances (eg sleep behaviour disorder), sensory disturbances, nutritional problems and problems of balance and falls. This chapter will focus on the depression in PD (dPD) which is the most common psychiatric non-motor symptom of PD. dPD is associated with a poor quality of life, excess disability, carer stress and treatment of depression can reduce functional disability\"",

Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Increased health-care costs, prolonged hospital stays, and long-term cognitive decline are well-recognized outcomes of delirium. Delirium can interfere dramatically with the recognition and control of other physical and psychological symptoms such as pain in later stages of illness. Delirium is one of the most common mental disorders encountered in general hospital practice. Delirium is highly prevalent in cancer and AIDS patients with advanced disease, particularly in the terminally ill patients in the last weeks of life, with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 88%. Many of the clinical features and symptoms of delirium can also be associated with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, mania, psychosis, and dementia.",

Depression of middle age is subdivided depending on the predomination of one or another disorder in the clinical picture. There are simple depression and complicated depression with additional psychopathological symptoms. The most difficult is to diagnose depression with onset in early childhood, including infant's age, when the psychopathological presentations depend on the consequences of the perinatal CNS lesion, maternal deprivation and other factors. In children, the clinical picture of depression differs by syndromologic incompleteness, peculiarity of phenomenological presentations and polymorphism of disorders. In adolescence, depression is characterized by the predominance of behavioral disorders, marked psychopathic-like disorders, suicidal attempts, higher frequency of bipolar forms. Depression with late age at onset differs by the abundance of somatic and hypochondriac complaints, anxiety and depressive delusion accompanied by the transitory aggravation of cognitive impairment (depressive pseudodementia).",

Disturbed sleep can result in fatigue, irritability, morning headaches, impaired motor and cognitive skills, depression, and daytime somnolence. The major sleep complaints include insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia, excessive nocturnal motor activity, circadian sleep–wake rhythm disturbance, and respiratory dysrhythmia. The pathogenetic mechanisms of sleep disturbances may be secondary to direct structural alteration of the sleep–wake generating neurons or from several other indirect mechanisms. At the biochemical level, neurodegenerative diseases may be largely classified as tauopathies, α-synucleinopathies, and other diseases. Overnight polysomnography (PSG), Multiple Sleep Latency Test, Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, and actigraphy are some important diagnostic laboratory tests in the evaluation of sleep disturbances. Management of sleep disturbances is complex and is based primarily on the nature of the sleep disturbance. The clinical profiles, pathogenetic mechanisms, PSG findings, and management issues are discussed here with reference to some common neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Common psychiatric problems in cancer patients include depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and delirium. Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

To investigate more systematically the PSG characteristics of sleep in mania, all-night PSG evaluations were performed for two to four consecutive nights in 19 young manic patients (age range, 18 to 36 years), 19 age-matched patients with major depression, and 19 age-matched normal control subjects. Manic and depressed patients displayed nearly identical profiles of PSG abnormalities compared with normal control subjects, including disturbed sleep continuity, increased percentage of stage 1 sleep, shortened rapid eye movement latency, and increased rapid eye movement density. These results are similar to those reported in previous studies of major depression, and they are consistent with the possibility that the sleep disturbance in mania and major depression is caused by the same mechanism.",

Mechanisms connecting sleep deprivation and mood disorders remain, however, unclear.The current research topic represents a collection of papers investigating the relationship between sleep abnormalities and mood disorders, as well as studies analyzing potential mechanisms connecting these pathologies. As Taken together, this research topic covers several aspects of sleep disturbances and mood disorders and updates readers on the latest research in this field.

The obtained results show that the patients with apnea syndrome sleep very badly, and consequently, shortened sleep latency and frequent body movements, along with apneas, are regarded as the leading polysomnographic symptoms. Vigilance profile during sleep, that is, interchange and frequency of each of sleep stages (I, II, III, IV, REM) are similar in both tested groups. The suppression of restitutive stages of sleep (III, IV, REM) is considered to be a dominant characteristic of vigilance during sleep in obese persons and obese persons with manifest apnea syndrome. Relatively prolonged sleep latency in obese persons without manifest apnea syndrome indicates, however, restitutively higher quality of their nocturnal sleep. Contrary to the patients with apnea syndrome, they do not suffer from excessive evening somnolence, so that their daily alertness and sleep vigilance during night are of a better quality, although the lack of deep and REM sleep is observed in them as well.",

Anxiety allows you to protect yourself and your loved ones from harm and prepare for significant events, and also serves as an important signal to take strong action in a stressful situation. The study and understanding of the specifics of the clinical structure, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of stress-related disorders in persons who have suffered as a result of hostilities is indeed the main concern for social and medical issues of our society. As the results of the study showed, patients most often complain of the following symptoms: the affect of longing (boredom, despondency, sadness, sorrow), depressed mood, a feeling of tension, danger and tightness, difficulties in adapting to new surroundings, anxiety over small things, irritability and impatience, lack of hope and prospects, internal tension with the inability to relax, a sense of loss of control over one's life, obsessive fears, sleep disorders, psycho-traumatic memories, fears and fixation on subjectively significant negative information about events in the occupied territories. In the clinical structure of post-traumatic stress disorders in the examined patients, it was found: post-traumatic stress disorder (F43.1), adjustment disorders (prolonged anxiety-depressive reaction) (F43.21), anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) and panic disorder (F41.0).

Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "abstract": "Clinical experiences as well as specific investigations show that pain and sleep disturbances are closely correlated. The aims of this review are first to describe sleep disturbances related to painful medical diseases and analgesics and secondly to propose management possibilities for these sleep disturbances.The viewpoints presented were based mainly on objective rest activity and sleep studies using actigraphy and polysomnography.Polysomnographic and actigraphic studies have described significant sleep disturbances in patients suffering from different pain disorders. These disturbances are: reduced sleep efficiency and altered sleep architecture characterized by increased wakefulness and stage 1 non-rapid eye movement sleep, associated with diminished slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. Sleep disturbances may be related to pain and to the analgesic or sedative medications administered.If many factors, including pain, disease process per se, as well as medication, could disturb sleep, sleep disturbances may also adversely affect the natural course of the painful disease. Improving sleep quantity and quality in patients with painful disorders may break this vicious circle and as consequence enhance the patients' overall health and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias can often be confused for seizures and vice versa, but differentiating between them is often necessary. Seizures, in general, occur more frequently during sleep or sleep-wake transitions, so having nocturnal events is not uncommon. Limb movements or other behaviors during sleep are not always seizure-related. Some parasomnias such as sleep enuresis, somnambulism, and somniloquy are more common in children. Sleep terrors, nightmares and rapid eye movement behavioral disorder can be confused with seizures. A careful history can often help differentiate between seizures and parasomnias, but in many cases polysomnography and/or video-EEG is required for definitive characterization. As the approach to treatment can be different, it is important to correctly diagnose the condition.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Parasomnias are a category of sleep disorders in which abnormal events occur during sleep, due to inappropriately timed activation of physiological systems. Case report we report the case of a 41-year-old female who has no psychiatric history. The patient went to emergency department because when she was starting to sleep, in the first state of sleep, she felts a sensation of paralysis in all her body, with incapacity for breathing, chest oppression and tactile hallucinations like something or someone was touching her entire body. Due to that, the patient awoke frightened, with high levels of anxiety, with heart palpitations, shortness of breath, trembling, choking feeling, sweating, nausea and fear of dying. When the patient arrived to the emergency department, she was suffering a panic attack, thinking that she could have some kind of neurological disease or she was suffering a heart attack. after treating the panic attack with 1 mg of lorazepam, all the symptoms subsided gradually. Discussion in this case report, we present a patient with a new-onset parasomnia, with hypnagogic hallucinations and a panic attack at the awakening. It is known that stress factors are closely associated with parasomnias, as we can see in this case because the patient was moving and she was sleeping in a new place. Conclusions Parasomnias are very frequently present in general population and they can trigger intense anxiety status that can lead to panic attacks.

      "abstract": "Introduction All infants cry and all cry for a reason. Indeed, the attributions applied to early infant crying range from pain to anger to boredom. In the first months of life, crying is particularly salient as infants have relatively few effective methods of communicating their needs and states. Developmentally, crying in early infancy is distinguished by its temporal qualities. Several studies have demonstrated that infants typically show an increase in their crying across the first three months, with a peak at around six to eight weeks of age. Importantly, crying decreases significantly around three to four months of age, coinciding with important developmental changes in affect, non-negative vocalizations and motor behaviour. As crying is considered a normal communicative signal, developmental outcomes for children who cry within the normal range are not of concern. However, some infants exceed the typical pattern of crying, such as those who cry long, hard and inconsolably during the first three months or those who fuss frequently beyond three to four months of age. It is these infants who are often believed to be “at risk” for developmental problems.",

      "title": "First oral treatment zuranolone’s FDA approval and its impact on postpartum depression: a new hope – a correspondence",
      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a type of mood disorder that affects some individuals after they give birth. It is characterized by a range of emotional and physical symptoms that can significantly impact a new parent's well-being, their ability to care for their baby, and their overall quality of life. PPD typically occurs within the first few weeks or months after childbirth, but it can develop anytime during the first year. New parents with PPD often experience intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emptiness. Irritability, mood swings, and excessive crying are also common. PPD can manifest with physical symptoms such as fatigue, changes in appetite (either overeating or loss of appetite), and disruptions in sleep patterns (difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much). Individuals with PPD might have trouble concentrating, making decisions, or focusing on tasks1. PPD affects a significant number of new parents in the United States. It is estimated that around one in seven women (or about 14–20%) experience PPD after giving birth. Women who have previously experienced PPD are at a higher risk of experiencing it again with subsequent pregnancies. The recurrence rate for PPD is estimated to be around 30–50%. Many cases of PPD go undiagnosed and untreated. Only about 15% of individuals with PPD receive professional help2. In 2017, a research study revealed that suicide constituted ~5% of perinatal fatalities among Canadian women, predominantly happening within the initial 3 months following childbirth due to PPD3. Current treatment of PPD includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline and fluoxetine are commonly prescribed for PPD (Table 1). Table 1 - Pharmacological treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and escitalopram (Lexapro) are often considered first-line treatments for postpartum depression (PPD). They work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which can help alleviate depressive symptoms. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) SNRIs like venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) also affect serotonin levels, but they additionally impact norepinephrine. These medications can be effective for PPD in some cases. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) While less commonly prescribed due to potential side effects, TCAs like amitriptyline and nortriptyline may be considered when other options are not effective or well-tolerated. Atypical antidepressants Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is an example of an atypical antidepressant that affects both dopamine and norepinephrine. It can be used as an alternative for individuals who have not responded to SSRIs or SNRIs. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) MAOIs like phenelzine (Nardil) are usually reserved for cases where other treatments have failed due to their potential interactions with certain foods and medications. Yet, these medications can take weeks to work and may lead to side effects. Concerns about breastfeeding can also impact treatment decisions. Estrogen therapy stabilizes hormone levels linked to PPD, but it is still being studied, and its risks and side effects need more investigation. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps manage PPD symptoms by changing negative thought patterns. However, access to qualified therapists can be limited, and attending regular sessions might be challenging for new mothers. Recently FDA approved first oral treatment of zuranolone to treat PPD4. Zuranolone belongs to a class of drugs known as positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors. GABA-A receptors are critical components of the central nervous system that play a crucial role in regulating mood, anxiety, and other emotional states. Zuranolone's mechanism of action involves enhancing the activity of GABA-A receptors. GABA-A receptors are inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, and their activation leads to a reduction in neuronal excitability, thereby promoting relaxation and calming effects. By acting as a positive allosteric modulator, zuranolone amplifies the response of GABA-A receptors to the neurotransmitter GABA, resulting in anxiolytic and antidepressant effects4. For treating PPD, the efficacy of Zurzuvae in adults was assessed by conducting two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind and multicenter studies5. During this phase 3 trial with a double-blind design, women experiencing severe PPD were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a daily dosage of 50 mg zuranolone or a placebo for a period of 14 days. The primary focus of the study was to assess the change in the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) from their initial state on day 15. Noteworthy secondary objectives included measuring changes in HAM-D scores on days 3, 28, and 45, as well as evaluating the alteration in severity based on the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI-S) on day 15. Throughout the trial, adverse events were closely monitored and recorded. Among the 196 patients who were randomly assigned (zuranolone, N=98; placebo, N=98), a total of 170 participants (86.7%) successfully completed the 45-day study period. The utilization of zuranolone in comparison to the placebo yielded statistically notable enhancements in depressive symptoms by day 15. Moreover, significant amelioration in depressive symptoms was also noted5. Zuranolone can be more discreet and less stigmatizing compared to other forms of treatment, such as injections or hospital visits. This may encourage more individuals to seek help for their PPD symptoms. It will have higher rates of patient compliance since they are simple to take and integrate into daily routines. It can be distributed through a wider range of healthcare settings, potentially increasing accessibility to PPD treatment in both urban and rural areas. It can provide flexibility in dosing, allowing healthcare providers to tailor treatment plans to the individual needs of each patient. It can facilitate early intervention for PPD and has the potential to reduce hospitalization. Although zuranolone's FDA approval for PPD is promising, there are still some challenges to consider for its use. Not all individuals may respond equally to zuranolone, leading to variations in its effectiveness. Some women might experience significant improvements, while others might not see the same results. Like any medication, zuranolone could potentially have side effects ranging from mild to severe. Balancing the benefits with the potential risks is essential. The long-term effects of using zuranolone, especially during the postpartum period, need further exploration. Monitoring its impact on both maternal health and infant development is crucial. The accessibility of zuranolone could be a concern, as new medications might initially have a higher cost and limited availability, potentially limiting access for some individuals. Zuranolone's interactions with other medications or treatments that postpartum women might be taking should be thoroughly studied to avoid any adverse effects. PPD is a complex condition that can vary greatly between individuals. Finding the right dosage and treatment plan tailored to each woman's needs might require careful consideration. While zuranolone offers a pharmacological approach, it is important not to overlook the benefits of psychosocial interventions, such as therapy and support groups, in the overall treatment plan. Overcoming the stigma associated with PPD and seeking help is a challenge. Some women might be hesitant to use medication due to concerns about judgment or societal perceptions. Healthcare providers need to be adequately educated about zuranolone and its potential benefits and limitations to make informed decisions and provide comprehensive care. Determining the appropriate duration of zuranolone treatment and ensuring a smooth transition to other forms of support after discontinuation are important aspects to address. There remains a need for comprehensive studies that delve deeper into its long-term effects, interactions with other medications, and its impact on diverse populations. Rigorous clinical trials and longitudinal studies can provide invaluable insights into the treatment's efficacy, safety, and potential limitations. The approval of zuranolone could potentially have a broader impact beyond its application in PPD. As researchers and clinicians gain a deeper understanding of its mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, there is a possibility that zuranolone's insights may extend to other mental health conditions.

Dysarthria is a disorder that occurs as a result of a brain condition that often makes it very difficult to articulate sounds and pronounce words, leading to impairments in the intelligibility, audibility, naturalness and efficiency of vocal communication. There are many potential causes of dysarthria. These include toxic, metabolic, degenerative diseases, traumatic brain injury, or thrombotic or embolic stroke. Central or peripheral neurological lesions can lead to paralysis or a lack of coordination of the verbo-motor system, producing severe speech disorders, which in turn prevent control over the tongue, throat, lips or lungs; for example, swallowing (dysphagia) and mastication problems. Dysarthria is different from verbal apraxia, it does not include speech disorders generated by structural anomalies (malformations). The symptomatology is very diverse, depending on the intensity of the neuronal damage, which is correlated with the etiology, which includes toxic, metabolic, degenerative diseases, traumatic brain injuries or thrombotic or embolic stroke. From the perspective of the location of the lesion on the brain, the classification of dysarthria is presented, and the forms are described.",

      "abstract": "One of the main advantages of long-term recording of epileptics is the possibility to monitor these patients during natural sleep. In this chapter, we first describe the reciprocal influence of sleep and epilepsy. On the one hand, sleep and circadian fluctuation of the state of vigilance have a marked influence on the occurrence of generalized and partial seizures as well as on the frequency, morphology and distribution of interictal epileptic discharges. On the other hand, a wide range of sleep disturbances has been documented in epileptics and there is some evidence that sleep disturbance and epilepsy may aggravate and perpetuate one another. Long-term EEG monitoring during sleep is of major importance when investigating epileptics with nocturnal attacks to determine whether these nocturnal episodes represent an ictal manifestation or an independent non-epileptic sleep disorder. In special forms of epilepsy, sleep recording is not only useful but necessary for the diagnosis. Various activation procedures are carried out on patients in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty regarding the presence or the type of epilepsy. Some of these procedures employ sleep: namely sedated sleep, sleep after sleep deprivation and all-night sleep recording. The diagnostic value and the indications of these activation studies are reviewed.",

      "title": "Stress and insomnia – A vicious circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterised by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school and social settings. The common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood, irritability, general discomfort and cognitive difficulties. On the other hand, stress results from emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can make a person feel frustrated, angry or anxious. Stress is the body’s response to a challenge or demand, accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stress depends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual’s characteristics, their neuroendocrine system and the combination of these elements, collectively determining how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include cognitive behavioural therapy, improving sleep hygiene and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than address its underlying cause. In the context of homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual’s unique structure, composition, nature and physical makeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualise each case and administer a simillimum remedy, the remedy most likely to restore health, and achieve complete healing according to homoeopathic principles. This review explores the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur due to the interplay between stress and the development of insomnia.",

      "title": "Survey of 100 Epileptics who have not had Seizures for Ten Years or More",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

Insomnia usually takes the form of frequent nocturnal awakenings (\"sleep fragmentation\"). There are numerous factors contribute to insomnia in PD, including the persistence or recurrence of PD symptoms (especially tremor and immobility) during light stages of sleep, effects of medications used to treat PD on sleep, depression, restless legs syndrome, and nocturia. Identification and minimization of such factors is the first step in proper management. General sleep hygiene principles are outlined.

      "title": "Clumsy Child",
      "abstract": "It has been estimated that 6% to 7% of school-aged children manifest poor coordination.1 Clinicians will rarely identify the presence of this type of disability from their findings during routine physical and neurologic examinations. What is required is careful observation of the child during performance of fine and gross developmental motor tasks. It is infrequent that parents will express concern to the pediatrician, unless they have clues from nursery school or grade school teachers, coaches, peers, or, occasionally, from the child him- or herself. The child is usually the first one to be aware of motor limitations, especially when he or she is in competition with children of the same age. Unfortunately, the child does not usually verbalize his or her concern but will refrain from participating in competitive motor activities to conceal motor inadequacies. DEFINITION The term \"clumsy child\" refers to a boy or girl who performs fine and/or gross motor tasks in an immature, disorganized, erratic, slow, irregular, or inconsistent fashion. The relevant motor skills are imprecise rather than grossly impaired and the neurologic examination does not reveal significant postural disabilities or involuntary movements. SIGNIFICANCE A pediatrician should not minimize the significance of clumsiness. It is frequently associated with other evidence of cerebral dysfunction, such as cognitive and/or perceptual impairments that may result in learning disabilities.",

Indeed, in many respiratory clinics OSAHS is now the most common diagnosis. Neurologists need to be familiar with the OSAHS because it may present rather like some primarily neurological conditions, and because patients with neurological and neuromuscular disorders can develop the OSAHS. Indeed, in the February 2002 issue of <i>Practical Neurology</i>, Sam Berkovic and Philip King urged neurologists to wake up to sleep medicine (Berkovic &amp; King 2002). The best definition of the OSAHS is at least five, some would say 15, breathing pauses (apnoeas) or hypopnoeas (near apnoeas), each lasting 10 s or more, per hour of sleep in association with sleepiness or at least two other major symptoms, including difficulty concentrating, unrefreshing nocturnal sleep or nocturia (Table 1).

      "abstract": "Biological, environmental, behavioral, and social factors can influence sleep and lead to sleep disorders or diseases. Sleep disorders are common, numerous, and heterogeneous in terms of their etiology, pathogenesis, and symptomatology. The management of sleep–wake circadian disorders (SWCDs) includes education on sleep hygiene, behavioral strategies, psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly), instrument-based treatments (i.e., positive airway pressure therapy, hypoglossal nerve stimulation), and pharmacotherapy. Depending on the disease, therapy varies and is executed sequentially or can be a combination of several forms of therapy. Drugs used for SWCDs include traditional sleep- or wake-promoting agents and chronotherapeutic agents. Recently, novel medications, which more precisely act on specific neurochemical systems (i.e., the orexin system) important for sleep and waking, are also increasingly being used. In this review, the pharmacotherapy of common sleep disorders (insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorder, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders) embedded in the overall therapeutic concept of each disorder is presented. There is also an outlook on possible future pharmacotherapies.",

The etiology remains unclear, but there may be a genetic predisposition (haplotype HLA-DR1), associated with environmental factors [6,7]. The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is one of the anxiety disorders, characterized by sudden and unexpected attacks of panic. Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Child and adolescent psychiatry is a broad dis­cipline relevant to any health professional who has regular contact with young people. Childhood emotional, behavioural, and developmental prob­lems are common, especially in children with other medical or social difficulties. This chapter aims to provide an approach to child mental health diffi­culties, while Chapter 32 deals with common and/ or important psychiatric disorders that are specific to childhood. You may find it helpful to revise some basic child development— this can be found in any general paediatrics text (see ‘Further reading’). An overview of the differences between child and adult psychiatry is shown in Box 17.1. As in adult psychiatry, diagnosis of psychiatric dis­orders often relies on the clinician being able to recog­nize variants of and the limits of normal behaviour and emotions. In children, problems should be classified as either a delay in, or a deviation from, the usual pattern of development. Sometimes problems are due to an excess of what is an inherently normal characteristic in young people (e.g. anger in oppositional defiance disorder), rather than a new phenomenon (e.g. hallu­cinations or self- harm) as is frequently seen in adults. There are four types of symptoms that typically pre­sent to child and adolescent psychiatry services: … 1 Emotional symptoms: anxiety, fears, obsessions, mood, sleep, appetite, somatization. 2 Behavioural disorders: defiant behaviour, aggression, antisocial behaviour, eating disorders. 3 Developmental delays: motor, speech, play, attention, bladder/ bowels, reading, writing and maths. 4 Relationship difficulties with other children or adults…. There will also be other presenting complaints which fit the usual presentation of an adult disorder (e.g. mania, psychosis), and these are classified as they would be in an adult. Occasionally, there will also be a situ­ation where the child is healthy, but the problem is ei­ther a parental illness, or abuse of the child by an adult. Learning disorders are covered in Chapter 19. Table 17.1 outlines specific psychiatric conditions diagnosed at less than 18 years, and Box 17.2 lists general psychiatric conditions that are also commonly found in children.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "title": "Djinnati Syndrome in Baluchistan: The Role of Traumatic and Abuse Experiences on Individual Vulnerability",
      "abstract": "is a culture-bound syndrome in Baluchestan, Iran. Experts believe that dissociation theory is more suitable for providing a psychopathological description of this syndrome in this region. In addition, they highlight need for investigating its pathology, particularly role of factors such as traumatic and abuse experiences during childhood.\r\n\r\nAccording to 4th edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (1), the essential feature of dissociative disorders is a disruption in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception of environment. The disturbance may be sudden or gradual, transient or chronic. According to DSM-IV-TR, dissociative disorders include: dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue and unspecified dissociative disorder. A dissociate disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) is a disorder that includes a dissociative symptom (i.e. disturbance in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity or perception of environment), that does not meet criteria for any specific dissociative disorder.\r\n\r\nIn addition, according to DSM a dissociative state may be defined as a dissociative trance disorder that includes a possession or trance state. Dissociative trance disorder is a single or episodic disturbance in state of consciousness, identity, or memory that are indigenous to particular locations and cultures. Dissociative trance involves narrowing of awareness of immediate surroundings or stereotyped behaviors or movements that are experienced as being beyond one’s control. Possession trance involves replacement of customary sense of personal identity or a new identity, attributed to influence of a spirit, power, deity, or other person, and is associated with stereotyped “involuntary” movements or amnesia. It is probably most prevalent dissociative disorder in Asia. The dissociative or trance disorder is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.\r\n\r\nMany culture-related syndromes, such as amok, bebainan, latah, pibloktoq, ataque de nervios and possession, shin-byung, enchantment, lack of spirit, Zar and djinnati (2, 3), are considered as dissociative disorders. Culture-bound syndromes include a set of psychological phenomena that are of interest to psychologists and psychiatrists. The eclectic nature of this syndrome has made it difficult to have a precise definition. Thus, deciding on a specific definition has been controversial. According to DSM, term culture-bound syndrome denotes a locality-specific pattern and repetition of an aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be illnesses, or at least afflictions that mostly have local names. Culture-bound syndromes do not one-by-one match routine diagnostic system diseases. Most of these syndromes were initially reported as an issue specific to a certain culture or a relevant set, or geographically-related to original culture (4).\r\n\r\nThe term Djinnati is a culture-bound syndrome, widely known by that name in Iranian and Pakistani Baluchestan (3, 5). Based on clinical observations, this syndrome was introduced by Bakhshani and Kianpoor in Baluchestan, Iran (6). A new study by Bakhshani et al. (3) on a rural population in Baluchestan showed total prevalence of 0.5% and 1.03% among rural population and women of that population, respectively. Common symptoms of this disorder include disruption in consciousness, memory and stereotyped behaviors such as laughing, crying, speaking incomprehensibly, which are attributed to a new identity known as Djinn. Attacks usually begin with pain, irritation and sometimes limb paralysis. In some groups, loss of speech and in some other cases, speaking in different languages and change in speaking rhythm and tone of voice have been reported. In addition, there was a partial and rarely complete amnesia during attack. Some patients were far beyond their physical strength. In addition, lack of control and harming themselves and others, during attack, have been reported; although, injuries were not serious. Sometimes during attack, The patients express some demands and possessor (Djinn) requests for satisfying these demands. Attacks usually last from 30 minutes to two hours (3). \r\n\r\nIt seems that traumatic and abuse experiences have an essential role in initiation and maintenance of dissociative disorders (7, 8). Results from Bakhshani et al. (3) study showed that 43% of patients experienced their first attack after a traumatic accident (5). After civil war of Mozambique, based on results of a study reported by Igreja et al. (9) on 941 subjects (255 males and 686 females), trauma and civil war resulted damages, which explain high prevalence of this disorder.\r\n\r\nCastillo (10), believes that biological and psychoanalytic perspectives are not capable of explaining spirit possession. Etiologically, he suggested that spirit possession, similar to multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a spontaneous trance reaction to severe and negative events in environment (particularly child abuse). On other hand, Naring and Nijenhuis observed a significant correlation between traumatic events and possession experiences (11). In addition, Naring and Nijenhuis (11) considered dissociative identity disorder to be a consequence of childhood abuse or other traumatic events, thus support post-trauma model. In this regard, a study by Pasquini et al. (12), showed a relationship between traumatic experience in childhood and development of dissociative disorders. Kaplan et al. (13) found that those with higher score in dissociative experience scale had been more sexually abused during their childhood. They have been reported to commit further suicide and aggressive behaviors (13).\r\n\r\nIn general, it can be concluded that traumatic experiences, specifically childhood maltreatment and abuse, are related to possession and dissociative experiences. Therefore, in future studies, it is required to investigate type of cultural beliefs abuse and other environmental factors with onset of clinical signs of Djinatti, and then develop and practice preventive and therapeutic approaches, based on findings.",

      "title": "Sleep Disturbances in Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the commonest movement disorder. Though it is classified as a movement disorder and is diagnosed based on motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremors, it is associated with several other non-motor symptoms such as cognitive, sleep, autonomic, and olfactory dysfunction. The authors have taken up the challenge of studying sleep disorders during the pandemic in patients with PD. Sleep-related disorders are difficult to study given the subjective nature of symptoms and the need for detailed history from a reliable bed partner or objective studies such as polysomnography which are time-consuming and cumbersome. These aspects limit the external validity of the data collected in the study. Using questionnaires, though may make the study more generalizable, would lead to inaccuracies in assessing the various sleep disorders. Sleep disorders in PD can present as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, and (REM) Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). These can occur due to co-existing depression, motor fluctuations, off periods, and stiffness during sleep, nocturia, RBD, or anxiety. Sleep disorders can also be related to the underlying disease per se. Sleep is a relatively overlooked symptom of PD as the other symptoms often overshadow the sleep disorders. Sleep disorders occur in more than 60% of patients with PD.[1] A good night's sleep is essential to ensure productivity during the day. Disturbed or fragmented sleep leads to excessive daytime sleepiness and thus hampers the personal and professional life of the individual. Sleep is also important in the consolidation of memory, and sleep dysfunction antedates the development of various neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.[23] Desai et al. (AIAN 255.22) have reported a case-control study comparing 50 patients with PD and 50 age, gender, and BMI-matched controls. This was a cross-sectional study in which they compared the sleep parameters between the patients and controls using validated questionnaires. They found that 88% of patients had one or more sleep disorders as compared to 28% of controls. This study was done during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, none of the patients or their home members have been reported to have had COVID-19. The controls have been selected from hospital staff, friends, and relatives of patients. It is unknown if the selected hospital staff had shift work, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when they were short-staffed due to various health-care workers getting infected. Other confounding factors such as nocturia, associated obstructive sleep apnea, motor fluctuations during sleep and anxiety due to disease status, COVID-19 pandemic per se, and health of other family members have not been considered. It is also unclear if the examiner assessing the participant was blinded to the disease status. The various associated symptoms such as RLS and RBD have been assessed using validated questionnaires. However, they could have over or underestimated these in comparison to polysomnography, and the authors have pointed out these limitations. Future studies may be designed to overcome these limitations. This paper has compared patients with PD with healthy controls. A study by Kumar et al.,[4] which included a multicenter cohort of 832 patients with PD, reported only 35% of patients with PD reporting sleep disturbances. This study did not have controls. In a study from Wuhan, the authors reported a 69% prevalence of sleep disorders in Chinese patients with PD in comparison to 44% of controls. They also found a significantly higher prevalence of poor sleep quality and depression in PD patients as compared to controls.[5] The authors of this paper have concluded that sleep disturbances have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In summary, this is a study comparing PD patients with controls done during the pandemic period. The setting in which the historical studies were done might have been different from the current study. In addition, several other confounding factors such as disease stage, associated comorbidities, medication status, and cognitive status might have been different from the older studies, which have not been considered or compared in this study. Thus, it may be difficult to conclude that the sleep disturbances had indeed increased during the pandemic in patients with PD. It would be interesting to know if this same cohort of patients would have a change in sleep-related parameters after the pandemic. A study by Saluja et al.[6] reported an increase in insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic in 31% of patients with PD as assessed by caregivers using a structured questionnaire. However, this study could be subject to recall bias. In a study during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with baseline, a study from Sweden found reduced sleep-related disturbances during the pandemic in patients with PD. This study had collected baseline ratings before the pandemic as a part of their registry, thus removing an element of recall bias.[7] The subject of sleep in patients with PD has been a neglected field. It is essential to follow up patients evaluated during the pandemic to study their long-term follow-up status. In addition, it would be interesting to know the long-term neurologic outcomes of the participants in the control group who had RBD, which is known to be a premotor symptom of PD.",

      "title": "Violence in sleep",
      "abstract": "Although generally considered as mutually exclusive, violence and sleep can coexist. Violence related to the sleep period is probably more frequent than generally assumed and can be observed in various conditions including parasomnias (such as arousal disorders and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder), epilepsy (in particular nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy) and psychiatric diseases (including delirium and dissociative states). Important advances in the fields of genetics, neuroimaging and behavioural neurology have expanded the understanding of the mechanisms underlying violence and its particular relation to sleep. The present review outlines the different sleep disorders associated with violence and aims at providing information on diagnosis, therapy and forensic issues. It also discusses current pathophysiological models, establishing a link between sleep-related violence and violence observed in other settings.",

      "abstract": "Razvojni poremećaj koordinacije (RPK) predstavlja neurološki poremećaj, odnosno poremećaj pokreta (procesa ideje, motornog planiranja i izvršenja pokreta). RPK utiče na svakodnevne veštine ali i na školska postignuća. Visoka prevalencija (5-8 %) govori u prilog tome da u svakom razredu ili vrtićkoj grupi možemo očekivati jedno dete/učenika za ovim problemom. Danas, za dijagnostikovanje ovog poremećaja koristimo DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) klasifikaciju (četiri kriterijuma). Prema ovom statističkom priručniku RPK se dijagnostikuje ako je izvođenje motoričkih veština ispod hronološkog uzrasta, ako ometa svakodnevne aktivnosti, ako je početak u razvojnom periodu i ako se motorički deficit ne može objasniti nekim drugim oštećenjem (npr. cerebralnom paralizom). Etilogija RPK je multifaktorska. Najviše problema učenici sa RPK pokazuju na nastavi fizičkog vaspitanja, srpskog jezika i matematike. Teškoće sa kojima se susreću su mnogobrojne počev od problema pripreme za čas fizičkog vaspitanja, učešća u takmičarskim igrama, preko problema čitanja, pisanja i računanja. U osnovi ovih teškoća leži problem motoričkog učenja. Zbog svega, vrlo je važno koristiti odgovarajuće strategije za rad sa ovim učenicima. Pravovremenim tretmanom, primenom odgovarajućih metoda i strategija u radu može se uticati na dalji tok i ishod ovog razvojnog poremećaja.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is often related with sleep disorders. In clinical practice insomnia is a common feature in schizophrenia. Difficulty falling asleep, maintaining or achieving a restful sleep is associated with symptoms severity and has been listed as a prodromal symptom of psychotic relapse. Sleep disturbances in schizophrenia may arise during the acute phase of illness and persists in many cases in chronic phase.The authors intend to review the main sleep disturbances observed in schizophrenia, the possible pathophysiological mechanisms, their clinical impact, and the effects of antipsychotic medication on sleep architecture.This study was carried out a systematic search of published literature from January 1965 to May 2010, through PubMed, using the following key words: sleep, REM sleep, NREM sleep, schizophrenia, polysomnography, actigraphy and antipsychotics.Most changes found in objective studies using the polysomnography, in patients with schizophrenia are: reduction of total sleep time, decrease in slow wave sleep, REM latency and sleep efficiency. Studies using actigraphy also reveal that these patients experience changes in circadian rhythm sleep disorders, specifically the irregular type and phase advance. Although some sleep disorders improve with antipsychotic treatment, in many cases, even during the remission of the disease, sleep continues fragmented , suggesting that there are physiopathologic mechanisms involved in sleep disturbance in these patients.Privation of adequate and restful sleep has a negative impact on rehabilitation strategies, quality of life of patients with schizophrenia, and may contribute to worsening of cognitive deficits.",

      "title": "Delayed speech development in children: Introduction to terminology",
      "abstract": "There has been recently an increase in the number of children diagnosed with delayed speech development. There is delay compensation with age, but mild deficiency often remains for life. Delayed speech development is more common in boys than in girls. Its etiology is unknown in most cases, so a child should be followed up to make an accurate diagnosis. Genetic predisposition or environmental factors frequently influence speech development. The course of its delays is various. In the history of a number of disorders (childhood disintegrative disorder, Landau–Kleffner syndrome), there is evidence for the normal development of speech to a certain period and then stops or even regresses. By way of comparison, there are generally speech developmental changes in autism even during the preverbal stage (a complex of revival fails to form; babbling is poor, low emotional, gibberish; at the same time, the baby recipes whole phrases without using them to communicate). These speech disorders are considered not only as a delay, but also as a developmental abnormality. Speech disorders in children should be diagnosed as early as possible in order to initiative corrective measures in time. In this case, a physician makes a diagnosis and a special education teacher does corrective work. The successful collaboration and mutual understanding of the specialists in these areas will determine quality of life for a child in the future. This paper focusses on the terminology and classification of delays, which are necessary for physicians and teachers to speak the same language.",

      "abstract": "Dysarthria is a disturbance in the sensorimotor processes of speech production associated with damage to the central and/or peripheral nervous system. Together with apraxia of speech (AoS; see Chapter 21, this volume), the dysarthrias comprise the motor speech disorders. In their classic text, Darley, Aronson, and Brown (1975) defined dysarthria as a speech disorder resulting from a weakness, paralysis, or incoordination of the speech musculature that is of neurological etiology. As will be discussed later in this chapter, this definition does not align completely with current concepts in neurology, especially in regard to the various syndromes in the category of movement disorders. Many dysarthrias are not accompanied by obvious weakness or paralysis, and incoordination is difficult to assess clinically. A more contemporary definition is from Duffy (2013): “A group of neurologic speech disorders resulting from abnormalities in the strength, speed, range, steadiness, tone, or accuracy of movements, required for control of the respiratory, phonatory, resonatory, articulatory, and prosodic aspects of speech production” (p. 4). Duffy expands this definition to indicate etiology (abnormalities of the central or peripheral nervous system) and associated motor signs or symptoms (weakness, spasticity, incoordination, involuntary movements, or excessive, reduced, or variable muscle tone). An alternative definition is given in a later section of this chapter following discussion of several background issues.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic inconsistent widespread pain and tenderness. It is also associated with other comorbid symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairments (memory and mood disturbances), and/or irritable bowel syndrome. <sup>[1]</sup> Prevalence of fibromyalgia is 2.7% globally, being slightly higher in middle aged women (4-9%). 75 to 100 % patients with fibromyalgia face depression, anxiety and/or stress. The probability of occurrence of depression is almost 40% at any stage in the course of fibromyalgia. <sup>[2]</sup> Patients usually report physical symptoms of depression (e.g. appetite, sleep, and sexual dysfunction) rather than mood-related psychological symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation, low self-esteem), however depression is affective expression of chronic pain and neuromarkers of both cannot be isolate. <sup>[3]</sup> Reviews done till date are either oriented toward specific form of exercise or towards specific outcome. We could not come across any review which included all form of exercise with measurement of multiple outcomes. <h3>Objectives</h3> The aim of this review was to 1) summarize evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 2) determine the most effective rehabilitation strategy for reducing pain and depression in people with FMS. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed, Ovid (Sp), and Cochrane search engines were used for identifying the studies done till 1 July 2022. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that have passive control group and active control group were included in this review for primary and secondary aim respectively. The primary outcome measures were Pain and depression. Secondary outcome was one from the sleep or fatigue or healthy related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 25 RCTs were included. Separate random effect model meta-analysis is performed for randomised control trial with active and passive control group. Mean difference or Standard Mean difference with 95% confidence interval used to assess the effect size. Studies with passive control group showed moderate to large positive effects on pain (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.38; I2 = 72%) and HRQOL(MD -5.40, 95% CI -10.17 to -0.62; I2 = 74%) but non-significant for sleep, fatigue, and depression. Furthermore, on subgroup analysis studies with short term protocol showed significant effect on pain only, whereas studies with long term protocols showed positive effect on pain and HRQOL only but non-significant at the time of post-trial follow-up. Studies with active control group represent non- significant results except mixed exercises which showed positive effect (MD -4.78, 95% CI -7.98 to -1.57; I2 = 0%) for HRQOL. <h3>Conclusion</h3> All rehabilitation strategies were effective for pain and HRQOL, and has marginal effect on depression, sleep, and fatigue but efficacy was not maintained at the time of post-trial follow-up. However, in this review we could not differentiate any rehabilitation strategies for the best among those used in the included studies. <h3>References</h3> [1]Queiroz LP.

      "abstract": "Sleep is essential for various cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes, including attention, memory, executive function, emotional regulation, and interpersonal interactions. Sleep disruptions undermine these functions, resulting in measurable impairments in daily activities, occupational performance, and public safety. Adequate sleep supports sustained vigilance and concentration, whereas sleep deprivation is associated with attentional lapses, diminished cognitive control, and impaired sensory processing. Memory consolidation, which depends on both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, is particularly susceptible to disruption by sleep loss. Executive functions, such as working memory, impulse control, and decision-making, are notably impaired due to the prefrontal cortex's heightened sensitivity to insufficient sleep. Sleep deprivation increases amygdala reactivity, weakens prefrontal-amygdala connectivity, and contributes to emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors. Chronic sleep deprivation exacerbates cognitive deficits, emotional instability, and motor performance decline, leading to higher error rates and reduced workplace productivity. Given its widespread consequences, chronic sleep deprivation constitutes a significant public health concern. This narrative review synthesizes contemporary research on the effects of sleep and sleep loss on waking behavior, with a focus on attention, memory, executive function, emotional regulation, and daytime performance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There have been various theories about the function of sleep. For example, some have emphasized its role in brain development and in learning and memory. No one theory accounts for all of the complexities of sleep in different species and at different ages. What is clear is that sleep is essential for recovery and restoration. Sustained effort leads to tiredness, fatigue, and the need to sleep. If sleep is persistently disturbed, you will be affected psychologically and perhaps physically. Loss of sleep or poor-quality (non-restorative) sleep leads to the build-up of a ‘sleep debt’. This increases the pressure to sleep in order to pay off the debt when the next opportunity to sleep becomes available. Repeatedly disturbed sleep progressively builds up the size of the sleep debt. Fortunately, it takes far less time to pay off this debt than it takes to incur it. In other words, a relatively short period of sound sleep is sufficient to offset the immediate effects of sleep loss.",

      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness arises frequently as a consequence of insufficient or shortened nocturnal sleep, or as a result of poor sleeps hygiene. One of the most common dyssomnias with imperative sleepiness is narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a chronic disease that greatly affects quality of life. The present study of 57 patients shows that the negative assessment is partly due to the subjective views exhibited by the narcoleptic personality prone to underestimation, negative self-image and depressive disposition. The personality traits may be due to an adaptation reaction to the disease but also to the biological predisposition. Comparison with population data for our Republic brought no evidence of progress at education or family life being adversely affected by narcolepsy, however, decreased assertion in employment and limitation in self-realization in free time was an explicit consequence of the disease. All 57 patients reported excessive daytime sleepiness as the most discomforting symptom that in 40% of them was responsible for career curtailment in a productive age and for living on partial or full disability.",

      "title": "Treatment for Enuresis",
      "abstract": "Monosymptomatic enuresis(bed-wetting without other symptoms) is a common problem in children, affecting 15% of five-year-olds and occurring more frequently in boys than in girls. Because it is usually caused by a physiologic maturational delay, the prevalence decreases with age. Children with enuresis have a small bladder capacity. Failure to awake to the micturition urge is not necessarily related to being a \"deep sleeper\", and children with enuresis may pass urine involuntarily because of the immature central nervous pathways. As the CNS pathways matures with age, most children are more easily aroused from sleep. There is strong evidence of a genetic predisposition for enuresis. Children with enuresis must be evaluated to reveal any underlying physiologic conditions or disease states, such as urinary tract infection or structural abnormality. Once these are ruled out, the goal is to stop the bed-wetting while preserving the child's self-esteem. However, before treatment of enuresis, concurrent problems, such as daytime enuresis and urgency or chronic constipation, should be managed. For the treatment of enuresis, the child wears a moisture alarm-a small, portable, transistorized device-to bed. The alarm sounds or vibrates when wet, awakening the child. Drug therapy for enuresis includes desmopressin, which decreases the urine volume, and imipramine and oxybutynin, which inhibit bladder contraction. Both delayed urinary control and current enuresis are associated with a markedly increased risk of behavioral, emotional, and academic problems.",

Sleep self-reports in AN suggest that these patients report poor sleep quality and reduced total sleep time. Weight loss, starvation and malnutrition can all affect sleep. Patients with eating disorders who have sleep disturbances have more severe symptomatology. Objectives The authors intend to review sleep disturbances observed in AN, describe possible pathophysiological mechanisms and evaluate the clinical impact of sleep disturbances on the treatment and prognosis of the disease. Methods In this study, a non-systematic search of published literature from January 1970 and August 2015 was carried out, through PubMed, using the following keywords: ‘sleep’, ‘anorexia nervosa’ and ‘insomnia’. Results These patients subjectively report having poor sleep quality, with difficulty falling asleep, interrupted sleep, early morning waking or reduced total sleep time. Sleep disturbances found in AN using polysomnography are: reduction in total sleep time, decrease in slow wave sleep, slow wave activity and reduced sleep efficiency. Conclusions Privation of adequate and restful sleep has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients, may contribute to the appearance of comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety, and to a poor prognosis for AN.

      "title": "Editorial Comment to <scp>S</scp>pina bifida occulta: Not to be overlooked in children with nocturnal enuresis",
      "abstract": "The majority of children achieve urinary control by the age of 3–4 years. However 5–10% of children have nocturnal enuresis, which is divided into monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) and non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE). Monosymptomatic enuresis is defined as enuresis in children without any other lower urinary tract symptoms and without a history of bladder dysfunction.1 A variety of diverse conditions, such as nocturnal polyuria, sleep disturbances, reduced bladder capacity, detrusor instability and urinary tract infections, have been proposed as causative factors for primary MNE (PMNE).2 It also has been reported that nearly 15% of these patients spontaneously achieve control each year, so that by the age of 15 years only 1% of the children have enuresis.3 Enuresis is a stressful condition for both affected children and their families. Treatment improves the self-esteem of these children. Various treatment modalities, such as an alarm system, desmopressin, a tricyclic antidepressant and behavioral therapy, have been used with variable success rates in these children. Combination therapy; that is, an alarm system along with bladder training, motivational therapy and pelvic floor muscle training, is more effective than each component individually. Although pharmacotherapy, such as desmopressin and a tricyclic antidepressant, are effective while on treatment, there is a high relapse rate after stopping the treatment. In a recent published review, it was suggested that combination therapy with anticholinergic therapy increases the efficacy of other established therapies, such as imipramine, desmopressin and enuresis alarms, by reducing the relapse rates by approximately 20%. However, it was not possible to identify the characteristics of children who would benefit from combination therapy.4 Why some children do not have spontaneous improvement or respond poorly to treatment is an important research question. Spina bifida occulta (SBO), which occurs as a result of failure of fusion of the posterior arches of the lumbar spine, has been linked with a wide spectrum of urodynamic abnormalities. Several earlier studies have reported a higher incidence of SBO in these children. However, it is not very clear whether the presence of SBO has an adverse effect on the clinical outcome. In one of the studies being published in this issue of the journal, Shin et al. studied 160 children with enuresis and found SBO in 26.9% of the cases.5 In this study, the authors also reported a higher response in the group without SBO compared with the group with SBO if managed with desmopressin. The authors have rightly mentioned that it is not clear why SBO should affect the response to treatment of nocturnal enuresis. Until researchers are able to establish the mechanism of this association, there will be a question mark on this association. Also, there is a need to follow these children after stopping treatment to see if there is a lasting effect in the group with and without SBO. Identification of children with reduced functional residual bladder capacity is another factor that has been observed in several studies. Increased bladder wall thickness and higher detrusor overactivity have been reported in PMNE as compared with NMNE.6 None declared.",

      "abstract": "Various research studies show that the amalgam of disordered sleep physiology, chronic fatigue, diffuse myalgia, and cognitive and behavioural symptoms constitutes a non-restorative sleep syndrome that may follow a febrile illness, as in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Where rheumatic complaints are prominent such a constellation of disturbed sleep physiology and symptoms also characterizes the fibromyalgia disorder. In contrast to the chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia is associated with a variety of initiating or perpetuating factors such as psychologically distressing events, primary sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder) and inflammatory rheumatic disease, as well as an acute febrile illness. The chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia have similar disordered sleep physiology, namely an alpha rhythm disturbance (7.5–11 Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep that accompanies increased nocturnal vigilance and light, unrefreshing sleep. Aspects of cytokine and cellular immune functions are shown to be related to the sleep-wake system. The evidence suggests a reciprocal relationship of the immune and sleep-wake systems. Interference either with the immune system (e.g. by a viral agent or by cytokines such as α-interferon or interleukin 2) or with the sleeping-waking brain system (e.g. by sleep deprivation) has effects on the other system and will be accompanied by the symptoms of the chronic fatigue syndrome.",

      "title": "Anxiety and Separation Disorders",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Anxiety is a physiologic response necessary for all human beings to survive. It helps protect individuals in dangerous situations and prepares them for challenges. Fears are the emotional response to a given stimuli or situation that is identified as threatening or scary. Fears are a normal part of development throughout childhood and adolescence, and they change throughout the life course (Table 1). Worries are the cognitive or thinking manifestations of fear and anxiety.Anxiety disorders are diagnosed when fears, worries, or anxiety occur outside the range of normal developmental responses or are extreme and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning (school, home, social settings). In anxiety disorders, the fear response is no longer adaptive and is either out of proportion to a stressor or occurs when there is no threat. Due to the physiologic mechanisms activated with the anxiety and stress response in the body, individuals who have chronic anxiety and stress have a greater risk of both physical and mental health problems. Individuals who have anxiety often present to their primary clinicians with frequent physical complaints, not necessarily reporting anxiety. Parents also may report significant changes in behavior, with increased opposition and tantrums in certain situations that are triggered by anxiety.Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses in children and adolescents, affecting 8% to 10% of this population. (1) The age of onset of anxiety disorders can be as early as the preschool years, but the condition generally does not cause substantial impairment until school age. Anxiety disorders can occur throughout the lifespan, but most adult anxiety disorders begin by early adolescent years. (2) Girls have twice the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders as boys. (1) Anxiety disorders can cause family distress and dysfunction, school refusal and avoidance, and social isolation. Untreated anxiety disorders increase the risk of developing further anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse. The long-term social impact of untreated anxiety disorder includes decreased academic and occupational achievement and poorer social and relationship outcomes. Anxiety disorders can be accompanied by comorbid conditions, such as medical illnesses, secondary anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, learning disorders, and mood disorders.Anxiety disorders tend to run in families, and this finding is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The reasons children develop an anxiety disorder are complex, but genetics, temperament, modeling, physiologic factors, and exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors all can contribute. Some young children have temperament styles that cause them to be more anxious and avoidant in new or unfamiliar situations, also known as behavioral inhibition. This temperament style increases the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in childhood, (3) but many children have no identifiable predisposing factors and still develop anxiety disorders. Some individuals have a heightened physiologic arousal to stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, which also can increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder. Maternal depression and anxiety have a significant influence on attachment, affecting the early environment and brain development of children. Maternal depression and anxiety can influence appropriate emotion regulation and stress responses, the effects of which can manifest as psychiatric illnesses, such as disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. Environmental and psychosocial stressors, including school issues, social difficulties, family dysfunction, trauma, and loss, can contribute to anxiety disorders.Anxiety is a physiologic response that is essential to the survival of human beings, involving fright/flight neurobiology and the stress response system. (4) The fright/flight response in the brain is regulated through sensory input (thalamus), context and memory (hippocampus), and emotion regulation (amygdala) systems, often referred to as components of the limbic system. This system is activated under stress and danger and prepares the body physiologically by activating the sympathetic adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The prefrontal cortex helps to modulate this response in the brain and to modify fear responses.In anxiety disorders, the fright/flight mechanism is activated in situations that are not a threat or overresponds in reaction to the stressor without appropriate response modulation. The release of stress hormones and adrenaline in the body inappropriately or in excess (given the situation) without appropriate regulation causes the feelings of fear and physical symptoms of anxiety (eg, stomachaches, nausea, headaches, increased heart rate, dizziness, sweating, shortness of breath, paresthesias, chest pain). Avoidance, tantrums, aggression, crying, trembling, somatic complaints, and seeking of reassurance all are common manifestations of anxiety. The avoidance and reliance on others to help manage fears may help to decrease anxiety temporarily but can become extreme and interfere with functioning at home, school, and socially and cause anxiety to worsen over time.Anxiety for some children may occur only in very specific situations or environments and for others can be more generalized. It is important to distinguish between appropriate and adaptive anxiety and stress and an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder is of long duration (usually lasting for many months), interferes substantially with functioning, and is out of synch with the magnitude of the stressor and developmental stage of the child. Adaptive anxiety and stress occur after a substantial change or transition (eg, starting school) and are expected responses to change or adversity. Anxiety disorders usually require intervention by a clinician; stress usually is of short duration (fewer than 2 weeks) and is likely to resolve spontaneously or be substantially ameliorated by social support or environmental modification alone.Diagnosis of the many types of anxiety disorders is based on criteria outlined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV TR). (5) Separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia are the most common childhood anxiety disorders, and social phobia (or social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in adolescence. Several anxiety disorder screening tools have been well validated for use in children and adolescents. The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) is a self-report screen for identifying anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) both have parent and self-report versions to screen for anxiety disorders in youth. These three scales are helpful for identifying youth at risk for anxiety disorders and for monitoring response to treatment. (6)Separation anxiety disorder is one of the most common anxiety disorders in school-age children. Separation anxiety is a normal stage of early development in preschoolers and during the initial few months of first attending school. It is considered a disorder if it continues past these stages or causes substantial distress for the child and family and interferes with normal functional developmental tasks. Children who have separation anxiety disorder fear something bad will happen to them or someone they love (usually parent or caregiver) when they are apart. This fear causes children to avoid being out of sight from the parent or caregiver or to have substantial distress and anxiety when they are separated or in anticipation of separation. By definition, the duration of the anxiety must be at least 4 weeks. Anxiety symptoms can manifest as physical complaints on school mornings that usually do not occur on weekend mornings or as behavior outbursts. The symptoms generally improve if the feared situation (eg, school) is avoided.Children who have separation anxiety disorder often are unable to be left with a babysitter, are not able to fall asleep on their own (parent falls asleep with them or they sleep in parents' room), and avoid school. The affected child demands substantial attention and time, which can lead to less parental time for other children in the family. Mothers usually are the caregivers demanded, which can result in a parent-child dyad that can exclude other members of the family to manage the child's anxiety. The child becomes dependent on the mother for reassurance and management of the anxiety and fear, thereby losing confidence in his or her ability to manage situations independently.Parents of children who have separation anxiety describe loss of their adult relationships and occupational consequences because at least one parent is home with the child who has not gone to school. Children who have separation anxiety disorder miss out on social opportunities with friends because they do not want to be away from their home and parents. This disorder can cause substantial distress and dysfunction for the child and family and interfere with the development of age-appropriate independence and academic success. One of the important functional impairments commonly associated with this disorder is school phobia or school refusal. (7)School refusal is described as a persistent pattern of not wanting to go to school, avoidance of school, or high distress associated with going to school. Although it is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis, school refusal can be a symptom of underlying psychiatric illness, most commonly an anxiety disorder. School refusal often is a complex problem that requires genuine understanding of individual and family factors to develop a successful treatment approach. One of the key treatment goals in school refusal derived from separation anxiety disorder is getting the child back into the school environment as soon as possible.It is important to differentiate school refusal related to anxiety from conduct problems and subsequent truancy. Youth who exhibit truancy generally do not report other symptoms of anxiety or issues of separation from parents. They are not at school, but the reason is not that they need to be with a parent or caregiver due to fear and anxiety. Truancy is characterized by a pattern of skipping school, lack of concern or embarrassment about not attending school, refusal to do any school work, and frequently hiding school absences from parents.Specific phobia is the most common type of anxiety disorder, but it often is managed by avoidance of the specific feared situation and less often presents for treatment. Many people have fears, with common ones including heights, spiders, snakes, blood, and needles. A specific phobia is fear of an object or situation that is not developmentally expected and is out of proportion to the actual danger and manifests as an anxiety response that is extreme and unreasonable (eg, avoidance or intense anxiety and panic). The specific fear must be present for at least 6 months and cause the child substantial distress or impairment in functioning to be considered a true phobia. Although many specific phobias do not come to medical attention, fear of needles in a child requiring vaccination and fear of choking with restriction of oral intake are two examples of situations requiring treatment due to associated health risks. Specific phobias sometimes are preceded by a traumatic event (such as becoming afraid of dogs after being bitten by a dog). Onset also can be associated with genetic predisposition, increased stress in the environment, and modeling behaviors in the environment (such as a parent's fear response to a situation).Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in teens, likely because of the increased importance of peers and social context in adolescent development. Youth who suffer from social anxiety disorder have severe anxiety in social situations that is extremely distressing and can lead to avoidance and substantial deterioration in overall function. Youth who have social anxiety disorder describe an overwhelming fear of drawing attention to themselves or saying something stupid or embarrassing around others, especially peers. This fear can lead to not being able to ask questions in class, not being able to talk in front of others, avoidance of the phone, not ordering in restaurants, and not using public bathrooms. Severe social anxiety disorder can result in isolation to the point of rarely leaving home, not having contact with friends, and not attending school.Generalized anxiety disorder can have its onset in childhood and adolescent years. The anxiety centers around everyday events and responsibilities in the child's life, such as school, friends, health, future, and finances, but the distress and worry are excessive, unrealistic, or unhelpful and persist for at least 6 months. Children may report feeling tense and irritable; have frequent muscle aches and pains; and experience poor sleep, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating due to the intensity and chronicity of the worried thoughts and feelings. Affected individuals may have academic performance anxiety that interferes with starting and completing assignments and taking tests due to fear of failure or that the result will not be good enough. A pattern of avoidance can develop to prevent a feared event or the youth may seek excessive reassurance from others that nothing bad will happen, leading to increased anxiety, decreased enjoyment, and avoidance of everyday activities.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder involving obsessions (distressing intrusive thoughts or images) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or rituals performed to relieve distress and anxiety associated with the obsessions) that are unwanted, cause substantial anxiety, and interfere with functioning (consuming more than 1 hour per day). The most common obsession themes are illness, contamination, and danger-related, and the most common compulsions are cleaning, washing rituals, and checking behaviors. OCD does not always involve observed compulsions, and the individual can suffer from repetitive images or thoughts (eg, of violent, religious, or sexual nature) that are extremely distressing. Children who have OCD generally have poor insight into their illness and may not recognize the obsessions and compulsions as irrational. They may have trouble going to school, find they are unable to concentrate in class, have difficulty getting out of the house or getting dressed, and have decreased food intake related to obsessions and compulsions. Parents commonly are involved in OCD routines and compulsions with children and teens, and the illness can have a substantial negative impact on family functioning.Panic disorder usually has its onset in adolescent years but can occur in children. Although not the most common anxiety disorder, this illness can become debilitating rapidly. Children who have panic attacks (Table 2) most commonly present initially to an emergency department or urgent care center because the physical symptoms are acute and escalate quickly, similar to having a heart attack, asthma attack, or even a stroke or seizure. Panic attacks can occur in any anxiety disorder or high-stress situation when the patient is presented with a feared stimulus. However, in panic disorder, the attacks occur \"out of the blue\" without clear precipitants or warning. Such unpredictability causes extreme fear and anxiety about having another attack, particularly in a place where others might see them or where escape or help might not be possible. Affected individuals avoid any situation they associate with having a panic attack as well as places where they fear that if they did have an attack they would not be able to manage it or get help. Teens who have panic disorder may stop all extracurricular activities, refuse to go anywhere without their parents, and stop going to school (or have extreme distress with school attendance).Anxiety disorder treatment in children and adolescents is one of the best-researched areas in child and adolescent mental health. Treatment of childhood anxiety includes both specific and nonspecific treatment approaches. Specific approaches are evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders and include structured psychotherapies (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Nonspecific treatments include activities that decrease stress, improve mood, and support well-being, including sleep hygiene, healthy eating, regular exercise, predictable routine, and social supports.Standard evidence-based anxiety disorder treatment guidelines recommend the use of CBT as first-line treatment for children who have anxiety disorders when this therapy is available. (8)(9) Many CBT programs and books are available, and the skills often are taught to both parents and child to support the implementation of the strategies and decrease indirect reinforcement of anxious behaviors and thinking. CBT includes psychoeducation and cognitive and behavior skills training to help individuals understand and better manage anxiety. Anxious children think catastrophically or overexaggerate the negative outcomes of situations and generate avoidant solutions, leading to significant distress and avoidance behaviors.The cognitive strategies include identifying anxiety symptoms and somatic symptoms related to anxiety, developing realistic thinking, and problem-solving. Behavioral strategies consist of relaxation and stress management techniques as well as gradual exposure to the feared situation to modify the anxiety response through systematic desensitization and habituation (Table 3). Many children experience improvement in their anxiety with CBT alone and do not require medication. In some cases, children and teens are unable to learn and use CBT strategies to manage their anxiety without pharmacologic treatment.Medications help decrease overall anxiety symptoms and panic response and should be considered if the anxiety is moderate to severe. The best evidence, supported by both meta-analyses (10) and a Cochrane review, (11) for pharmacologic treatment of childhood anxiety disorders favors the SSRIs. (9) Although some SSRIs have been approved for treating children who have depression (fluoxetine, escitalopram) and OCD (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline), SSRIs do not have United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, considerable evidence supports their efficacy. CBT in combination with an SSRI is recommended for moderate-to-severe anxiety disorders. (9)(12) Randomized, controlled trials of SSRI medications (sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) show effectiveness in treating children and adolescents who have anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11)Evidence is insufficient to recommend non-SSRI antidepressants such as venlafaxine for treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11) Strong evidence supports the efficacy of clomipramine in treatment of OCD, but the adverse effect profile does not support its use as first-line treatment. (9)(11) Benzodiazepines have been used for acute management of anxiety, but there is no evidence of their effectiveness for treatment of anxiety disorders in children. (9)(11)The risk/benefit ratio of initiating a medication trial should be considered in each situation, and the adverse effects should be disclosed fully, including the FDA black box warning for all antidepressants (the rare but increased risk for youth of experiencing suicidal ideation and behaviors while taking antidepressant medications). Initial doses should be minimal, with very gradual increases, as tolerated, according to symptom response and adverse effects, remembering that the medications take several weeks to start working and improvement continues for several months at a given dose. Although suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are not as common in childhood anxiety disorders as in depressive disorders, they may occur, and children should be monitored. (10) Medication should be viewed as helping the child decrease overall anxiety symptoms to allow success in learning and using anxiety management strategies. Given the adverse effects and risks of SSRI medication in children and the limited long-term safety data of these medications in the developing brain, medication intervention should be combined with CBT and healthy living strategies, with the goal of trying to taper the child off the medication within 1 year if he or she is doing well.Anxiety has the best chance of improving when both youth and family are educated about anxiety disorders and when there is support of the treatment plan. Numerous randomized, controlled trials support CBT and SSRIs as effective treatments for pediatric anxiety disorders.

      "title": "LMNB1-Related Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics LMNB1-related autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a slowly progressive disorder of central nervous system white matter characterized by onset of autonomic dysfunction in the fourth to fifth decade, followed by pyramidal and cerebellar abnormalities resulting in spasticity, ataxia, and tremor. Autonomic dysfunction can include bladder dysfunction, constipation, postural hypotension, erectile dysfunction, and (less often) impaired sweating. Pyramidal signs are often more prominent in the lower extremities (e.g., spastic weakness, hypertonia, clonus, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilateral Babinski signs). Cerebellar signs typically appear at the same time as the pyramidal signs and include gait ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, dysmetria, and nystagmus. Many individuals have sensory deficits starting in the lower limbs. Pseudobulbar palsy with dysarthria, dysphagia, and forced crying and laughing may appear in the seventh or eighth decade. Although cognitive function is usually preserved or only mildly impaired early in the disease course, dementia and psychiatric manifestations can occur as late manifestations. Affected individuals may survive for decades after onset. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LMNB1-related ADLD is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and MRI findings and either an LMNB1 duplication or (more rarely) a heterozygous deletion upstream of the LMNB1 promoter identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. For autonomic dysfunction: Neurogenic bladder may require management of urinary retention and/or urgency and recurrent urinary tract infection. Constipation may require good hydration, increased dietary fiber, stool softeners, and/or laxatives. Orthostatic hypotension can be minimized by pharmacologic intervention, compression stockings, physical therapy, and increased dietary salt. Erectile dysfunction is treated medically. Impaired sweating is managed with cool environment and attention to fever during infection. Spasticity may be treated with medications and physical therapy. Ataxia can be managed with strategies to minimize falls and increase strength, and adaptive equipment such as walkers or wheelchairs. Feeding difficulties can be managed with speech therapy and appropriate feeding interventions to assure adequate nutrition while preventing aspiration pneumonia. Surveillance: Routine assessment of: weight, nutrition, and feeding; pulmonary status (re possible recurrent pneumonia); bladder and erectile function; psychosocial well-being; and medications/doses to avoid iatrogenic polypharmacy. At least yearly assessment: by a neurologist for disease manifestations and progression; and by a physiatrist, orthopedist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist to address orthopedic, equipment, and functional needs. Genetic counseling LMNB1-related ADLD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all individuals diagnosed with LMNB1-related ADLD whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as the result of a large LMNB1 duplication (or a deletion upstream of LMNB1) inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an individual with LMNB1-related ADLD has a 50% chance of inheriting the LMNB1 duplication (or deletion upstream of LMNB1). Once the causative pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for LMNB1-related ADLD are possible.",

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

Three different symptoms can be described from the cases reported in the literature: disorder of voluntary lid closing and/or opening, cortical ptosis, and inability to keep the eyes closed for more than a few seconds (,,motor impersistance\"). This last symptom can be considered as an unspecific sign of brain-damage. For the disturbance of voluntary lid opening/closure, the term ,,cortical palsy\" of lid movements is proposed. Thus this symptom can be differentiated from other supranuclear disorders of lid movements where reflectory and/or spontaneous lid movements are also impaired.

      "title": "Generalized Versus Selective Cognitive Impairments Resulting from Brain Damage Sustained in Childhood",
      "abstract": "Children who have sustained focal brain damage frequently have learning problems. It is difficult to determine whether the learning problems are selective, in that they affect only certain domains of cognitive function, or generalized and consistent with restricted intellectual ability. To distinguish between the two types of outcome, the consequences of early damage to the hippocampus and its effects on memory are contrasted with the effects of early hemispheric damage and surgery on speech and language function. That global amnesia results from bilateral damage to the medial temporal lobe in adults has been known for nearly 50 years 1. Until recently, however, there were no reports of a similar syndrome resulting from medial temporal pathology incurred in infancy. The earliest injuries that had been reported to produce such an effect were those that occurred at ages 8–10 years 2-4. The absence of cases with injuries earlier than this had led to two possible explanations: (a) damage to the medial temporal lobes very early in life results not in selective memory impairment but in mental retardation because of the widespread effects of such early damage on the development of cognition; or (b) the functional effects of early medial temporal pathology are only transient because of the special plasticity and impressive reorganizational capacity of the immature brain. Both of these explanations have now been challenged by the discovery of several young patients who, in association with hypoxic–ischaemic episodes incurred perinatally or during early childhood, showed severe bilateral hippocampal pathology verified by magnetic resonance imaging, and marked impairments in recall and episodic memory (i.e., memory for everyday events), in the presence of relatively preserved recognition and semantic memory (i.e., memory for factual information) 5, 6. The spared abilities were sufficiently developed to enable these children to attend mainstream schools and to acquire average levels of intelligence, language, and literacy skills. Conversely, the memory impairments, evident on such everyday tasks as remembering routes, appointments, messages, and so on, were sufficiently severe and chronic to preclude independence later in life. To distinguish this unusual pattern of memory function from that commonly seen in adult-onset amnesia, the syndrome has been labeled “developmental amnesia”(Fig.1)6. A: Severely impaired performance of five patients with developmental amnesia of perinatal origin on a test of episodic memory, the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test. B: Normal performance of these same five patients on verbal IQ subtests assessing semantic memory. Interestingly, the memory problems of patients with developmental amnesia of perinatal origin typically become manifest many years after their original insult, as they grow older and are required to become responsible and look after their schedules, belongings, and homework. Furthermore, the patients with pathology of perinatal origin show as great an impairment in recall and in episodic memory as do the patients with onset of damage in middle childhood, suggesting that the increased plasticity associated with a very early age at damage does not overcome the adverse consequences of selective hippocampal pathology on cognitive memory 7. Diagnosis of such selective memory problems early in life is now of critical importance, both to provide the affected children with appropriate remedial help in school and in daily life, and to protect against the adverse socioemotional consequences that memory impairment can impose on the developing child and adult alike. Unlike patients with developmental amnesia who develop low average to average intelligence, language, and literacy skills in the presence of bilateral hippocampal pathology, the majority of patients with focal hemispheric damage leading to hemispherectomy in childhood show a generalized pattern of cognitive impairment, primarily manifested as a dramatic loss of intellectual ability 8. This restriction affects both verbal and nonverbal functions 8, 9. In rare cases where a discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal abilities does occur, it almost always favours verbal intelligence, suggesting that verbal functions tend to be rescued and nonverbal functions crowded out as a consequence of early hemispheric damage 9, 10. Against the background of restricted intellectual abilities, levels of language comprehension and expression, reading, spelling, and numeracy are usually in line with expectations derived from the full-scale IQ. This generalized impairment in all aspects of cognitive ability resulting from early pathology is independent of hemispheric side of removal, as outlined below 8. Left hemisphere damage sustained during early childhood, particularly before the age of 4 or 5 years, rarely produces long-lasting aphasia 11-13, provided the homologous areas on the right remain functional. Extensive left hemisphere damage sustained congenitally or perinatally (i.e., before the onset of speech) has not been reported to result in aphasia or even dysphasia, although there may be delays in the development of speech and language. Later in childhood, subtle deficits in the production and comprehension of higher-order aspects of language emerge, but these appear to reflect not difficulties in language, per se, rather the limits set by a general reduction of intellectual abilities after hemispheric dysfunction and removal. With extensive left hemisphere injury acquired before the age of 4 or 5 years but after the onset of speech, aphasic symptoms may result initially, but the symptoms generally resolve before hemispherectomy. Furthermore, there is usually postmorbid development of speech to a point where, as in the patients with congenital or perinatal injury, there is no longer a selective dysphasia 14, 15. Indeed, language production in these patients may actually exceed comprehension ability, which again tends to decline together with the pathology-induced reductions in overall intellectual capacity. When extensive left hemisphere pathology is acquired after the age of 5 or 6 years, a mild version of the adult pattern of aphasia typically emerges. In such cases, speech arrest, transient mutism, anomia, and/or agrammaticism are seen, and these symptoms may become chronic 16-18. Even then, however, speech tends to be a resilient function, with the patient able to communicate effectively through short phrases and sentences. Numerous reports have indicated that, except for temporary interference with speech and language at the onset of a right hemisphere seizure disorder, neither extensive pathology nor removal of this hemisphere impairs linguistic functions selectively 11, 19, 20. Unlike linguistic outcome after left hemispherectomy, outcome after right hemispherectomy appears to be less dependent on the age at initial pathology, there being no reports in the literature of chronic dysphasic symptoms after right hemisphere pathology incurred at any age. Thus, with right hemisphere damage acquired late in childhood, just as with such pathology acquired in adulthood, speech and language functions appear to be unaffected even at the outset of the disorder. With right-sided pathology acquired early but after the onset of speech, there may be some initial linguistic disturbances (e.g., slurring, disorganized, or irrelevant speech) associated presumably with interhemispheric spread of epileptic activity, but these effects ordinarily resolve after hemispherectomy and arrest of seizures. Finally, right-sided, like left-sided pathology of congenital/perinatal onset may result in delayed development of speech and language, but there are no selective deficits. Rather, as with pathology leading to removal of the left hemisphere, damage and subsequent removal on the right at any age has an indirect effect on linguistic function that is related to the lowering of intelligence 8, 15. Because patients with either early-acquired or late-acquired pathology leading to left or right hemispherectomy have had acute-onset seizures, it is often difficult to disentangle the effects of seizures, per se, from those of the underlying pathology. The same confounding factor exists in most patients with congenital/perinatal pathology, because such pathology is commonly accompanied by early-onset seizures. There are exceptions, however, and these add support to existing evidence 21 that the seizures, or the associated anticonvulsant treatments, are particularly deleterious to both linguistic and intellectual development. When both the initial pathology and its related seizure disorder commence early in life, then intellectual and, as a consequence, linguistic outcome can be extremely poor. In such cases of early-onset, drug-resistant seizures, the prospects for a favourable intellectual and linguistic outcome are greatly improved by early hemispherectomy, presumably because it minimizes the chance that seizures will further damage or produce chronic dysfunction in the remaining hemisphere, particularly during early development. Late onset of protracted seizures is less deleterious for intellectual ability than early onset, however. For example, patients with middle- to late-childhood onset of epilepsy associated with Rasmussen's encephalitis 22 have better preserved nonverbal intellectual ability in the presence of selective linguistic and verbal intellectual impairments than do those with early-onset seizures 8, 18. This brief overview of the effects of neuropathology on the development of memory and speech and language functions indicates that there are definite limits to rescuing of cognitive functions in the face of early brain damage. Thus, in the domain of cognitive memory, episodic memory is selectively impaired after bilateral hippocampal pathology, even when this pathology is sustained perinatally. In the domain of language function, there is evidence of rescuing of speech and basic communication abilities, but this is often achieved at the cost of nonverbal cognitive functions being “crowded out.” More importantly, early unilateral brain damage leading to hemispherectomy places a heavy cost on intellectual ability, and thus sets limits on the ultimate development of all aspects of cognitive function.",

These conditions may not always be associated with dyspnea.Orthopnea is the sensation of breathlessness in the recumbent position, relieved by sitting or standing. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) is a sensation of shortness of breath that awakens the patient, often after 1 or 2 hours of sleep, and is usually relieved in the upright position.Two uncommon types of breathlessness are trepopnea and platypnea.

      "title": "The Effect of Insomnia Definitions, Terminology, and Classifications on Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "There is a need for newer, more clinically useful classifications for insomnia. Identification of specific subtypes of insomnia helps anchor research, allows for prediction of prognosis/course of the condition, and may allow for individualization of treatment. Existing classifications differ, and many terms remain inadequately defined, which leads to diagnostic confusion. Historically, insomnia has been classified according to symptom type, symptom duration, and underlying cause, but these classifications have not been based on evidence of their utility, and newer research suggests the need for change. Symptoms may include difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and not feeling restored by sleep, although it has not been clear that it is possible to identify distinct subtypes of patients by symptom or that distinguishing symptom type affects the course of clinical treatment. Classification of insomnia by duration most commonly involves three categories: transient (no more than a few days), short‐term (up to 3 weeks), and long‐term (more than 3 weeks). This categorization is of uncertain utility and has been primarily based on nonempiric concerns about treatment with sedative‐hypnotic medications for periods longer than several weeks. The subtyping of insomnia in terms of whether there is an identifiable underlying cause such as a psychiatric or medical illness was based on an unproven assumption that in most instances other disorders caused insomnia. Recent studies suggest the need to revisit these classification strategies. Evidence that symptom types typically overlap and change over time complicates the categorization of subjects by whether they have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep or have nonrestorative sleep. New studies of the treatment of chronic insomnia change the perspective on duration of treatment and, as a result, classification of duration of disease. Two studies of nightly pharmacotherapy for insomnia including more than 800 insomnia patients have not identified any increase in the risks after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. In addition, nonpharmacological treatments demonstrate long‐lasting efficacy in patients with chronic insomnia, and the development of abbreviated cognitive‐behavioral therapies, which are particularly well suited to primary care practice, have improved their applicability. Newer studies of the relationships between insomnia and associated medical and psychiatric conditions undermine the notion that insomnia is always a symptom and caused by an underlying condition. They suggest that, although it is important to identify and treat these conditions, this may not be sufficient to alleviate the insomnia, which may adversely affect the course of the associated disorder. As a result, treatment targeted specifically to the insomnia should be considered. All of these developments point to an increasing ability to tailor therapy to the particular needs of patients and to optimize the clinical management of insomnia.",

Bipolar patients usually complain of cognitive deficits such as attentional or memory deficits Patients with bipolar disorder experiment during depressive episodes dysfunctions in attention (difficulties in focusing and maintaining attention), memory (deficits of declarative and nondeclarative memory, affected verbal recall and recognition), language (bradyphemia with longer moments of pause during speech), psychomotor performance (psychomotor inhibition, slowness of motor functions when the number of tasks increases), executive functions (limited ability to acquire or relearn different skills), general intellectual functioning (information processing deficits).

The management of the patients is very important. The present study focused on the clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods and long-term prognosis of this particular syndrome.The clinical data of 39 narcoleptic children were analyzed. Sleep EEG monitoring was performed in all patients. Among the 39 cases, 23 were followed up.All the patients manifested with excessive daytime sleepiness, with disrupted nocturnal sleep occurring in 35 cases. Cataplexy appeared in 36 cases, and sleep paralysis in 9, hypnagogic hallucination in 19, and automatic behavior in 6 cases, respectively. Sleep EEG monitoring demonstrated a short mean sleep latency (< 5 minutes) and two or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in 38 cases. Twenty-three of the 39 cases were followed-up. Seventeen cases were followed-up for over one year. The longest follow-up duration was 14 years. Methylphenidate was administered in 10 cases. The excessive daytime sleepiness had been improved in 7 cases (70%). No obvious adverse effects were found. Psychosocial and academic problems appeared in most cases.Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder. A definite diagnosis is established when the symptoms of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness occur in association with the characteristic findings on sleep EEG monitoring. Appropriate drug therapy and psychosocial management are of help for such patients. Stimulant medication is an important component of the overall treatment program. A comprehensive approach is necessary to meet the needs of children with narcolepsy. Family education and emotional support are key elements in the management plan. The overall goal for managing childhood narcolepsy is to assist the child and family in achieving optimal quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Functional opercular syndrome in childhood is an exceptional form of presentation of benign partial epilepsy with centro-temporal rolandic spikes (BECRS).We studied the evolution of four patients, three of them followed for more than 15 years. Two were siblings, and their father suffered from BECRS with permanent language problems (verbal dyspraxia) and difficulty of protunding his tongue in adulthood. A third patient suffered benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC). In all four patients the actual illness begun as a BECRS with opercular troubles as an ictal phenomena. At about four years of age, the opercular disfunction became evident, with severe drooling, facial hypomobility and speech disturbance which waxed and vanished along weeks, months or years, apparently not ictal. Antiepileptic drugs not only were unable to control this situation but also, some of them, like carbamazepine, even worsened the opercular disfunction, increased the number of seizures and enhanced the neuropsychologic disfunction. Only clobazam could achieve the control on opercular disfunction. After 16 years, no further treatment was needed for all patients. There were some permanent sequelae, as speech and orolingual dyspraxia and different neuropsychologic problems.Of noteworth the best performance was attained by the patient treated with clobazam on monotherapy.",

      "title": "Daytime Sleepiness and Sleep Attacks in Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of disturbed sleep in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) approaches 100% (1). Sleep abnormalities include decrements in total sleep time, sleep spindling, stages 3 and 4 slow-wave sleep, and rapid eye-movement (REM)-sleep accompanied by sleep fragmentation and poor sleep efficiency (2,3). As primary sleep disorders, which interfere similarly with sleep, are associated with pathological levels of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), EDS might be expected to be relatively commonplace in PD. Suprisingly, EDS in PD has received little prior attention. Only quite recently has subjective (4,5) and objective (6–8) documentation of EDS and intrusion of REM-sleep into daytime naps in PD rekindled interest and a decades-long debate as to whether dopamine (DA) participates in behavioral state control, and if it does, what its role(s) might be. Current heuristic models of behavioral state control have restricted themselves to prominent roles for acetylcholine and other monoamines (e.g., serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine). Exclusion of DA from these models derives largely from an inability to reconcile acknowledged influences of exogenous DA upon behavioral state with reported invariability of endogeneous DA activity across unique behavioral states. Lacking a comprehensive conceptual framework that incorporates DA in a sleep—wake state or circadian rhythm modulation, clinical recognition of thalamocortical arousal impairments in PD has been met with surprise and no single parsimonious explanation. It has become increasingly clear, however, that wake (i.e., a thalamocortical-aroused state characterized by electroencephalography [EEG] desynchronization) is strongly influenced by DA (9–11).",

Exploring the neurophysiology linking sleep with daytime performance in patients with developmental disabilities is now possible using minimally sufficient sleep and sleep-sensitive behavioral assays.

Recent evidence finds high quality sleep promotes brain plasticity, improves health measures, and enriches quality of life. Sleep treatments for apnea, insomnia, restless limbs, and conditioned sleep-aversion are available, although not readily provided, for people with developmental disabilities. This population would gain both clinical and behavioral benefits as improved sleep-monitoring, behavioral testing, and sleep-treatment technology is adapted to their needs.",

It is a developmental disorder of psychomotor skills that is manifested by impaired attention, motor hyperactivity and impulsivity. This disorder is characterized by early onset, the association of hyperactive and poorly coordinated behavior with marked inattention and lack of perseverance in performing tasks; and this behavior occurs in all situations and persists over time. This disorder is inappropriate for the child’s developmental age and maladaptive. Disorders of neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain with discrete neurological changes can lead to behavioral difficulties and other psychological problems. Most children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have comorbidities, often multiple comorbid conditions in the same person. Comorbidity was observed in both clinical and epidemiological samples. It is estimated that about two-thirds of children with this disorder have at least one other psychiatric disorder diagnosed. Symptoms persist and lead to significant difficulties in the daily functioning of the child, such as school success, social interactions, family and social functioning, etc. Recent studies indicate the presence of various neuroophthalmological disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD. The most common comorbidities in children and adolescents with ADHD that will be covered in this chapter are autism spectrum disorder, mood disorder, anxiety, learning disabilities, conduct disorders, tics disorder and epilepsy.",

Apneas of short duration are common, mostly central, and more frequent during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Obstructive apneas are rare in healthy control infants. Triggering factors such as respiratory syncitial virus infection can increase the frequency and the duration of apneas. Upper airway problems related to bone malformations, soft tissue infiltration, and neurologic lesions are responsible for obstructive apneas, but also for episodes of partial airway obstruction or upper airway resistance syndrome. In certain infants, an apparent-life-threatening event has been related to upper airway anomalies. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, a rare respiratory control disorder, may be presented by apneas. Polysomnography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep-disordered-breathing in infants. Early diagnosis of abnormal breathing during sleep is of critical importance for the neurocognitive development in infants. ” 1999 Harcourt Publishers Ltd",

Using sleep deprivation, we studied the extent to which age- and psychopathology-related sleep \"decay\" is reversible in aged normal, depressed, and demented subjects. Depression or probable Alzheimer's dementia compromised the augmentation of sleep continuity and SWS seen in healthy elderly following sleep deprivation. Rapid eye movement (REM) latency decreased during recovery sleep in the controls but increased in both patient groups. Compared with demented patients, depressed elderly had greater severity of sleep continuity disturbance both before and after sleep deprivation, a more protracted course of recovery sleep, and increased slow-wave density in the second non-REM (NREM) sleep period (during recovery). The REM sleep time was diminished in dementia compared with depression both at baseline and during recovery sleep. These differential effects of age, health, and neuropsychiatric disease on recovery from sleep loss are relevant to recovery or reversal theories of sleep and have implications for daytime well-being in the elderly.",

      "title": "Basic aspects of sleep–wake disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract A sound working knowledge of the diagnosis, significance, and treatment of sleep disorders is essential in all branches of clinical psychiatry. Unfortunately, however, psychiatrists and psychologists share with other specialties and disciplines an apparently universal neglect of sleep and its disorders in their training. Surveys in the United States and Europe point to the consistently meagre coverage of these topics in their courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The following account is an introductory overview of normal sleep, the effects of sleep disturbance, sleep disorders and the risk of failure to recognize them in psychiatric practice, assessment of sleep disturbance, and the various forms of treatment that are available. The aim is to provide a background for the other chapters in this section. The close links between the field of sleep disorders and psychiatry which make it essential that psychiatrists are familiar with the field are as follows: ♦ Sleep disturbance is an almost invariable feature and complication of psychiatric disorders from childhood to old age, with the risk of further reducing the individual's capacity to cope with their difficulties (see Table 4.14.1.3 for further details). ♦ Sleep disturbance can presage psychiatric disorder. ♦ Some psychotropic medications produce significant sleep disturbance. ♦ Of importance to liason psychiatry is the fact that many general medical or paediatric disorders disturb sleep sufficiently to contribute to psychological or psychiatric problems. ♦ Because of lack of familiarity with sleep disorders and their various manifestations, such disorders may well be misinterpreted as primary psychiatric disorders (or, indeed, other clinical conditions) with the result that effective treatments for the sleep disorder are unwittingly withheld (see later). Some of these points will be amplified in later sections of this chapter.",

      "title": "A Case of Transient Global Amnesia due to Marijuana Use",
      "abstract": "Transient amnesia is a temporary version of the amnestic syndrome. The most striking example of transient amnesia is the transient global amnesia (TGA) syndrome which lasts from several to 24 hours, with or without retrograde components of impairment, and any signs of neurological deficit in nature. In this syndrome, an otherwise cognitively intact individual suddenly loses memory of recent events, asks repetitive questions about his/her environment, and sometimes confabulates (1). TGA is typically described as amnesia of sudden onset regarding events of the present and the recent past (2). It can be caused by central vascular or ischemic lesions. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but includes laboratory tests and radiologic evaluation. TGA typically remits spontaneously, but may recur. There is no specific treatment for amnesia. General stabilization of the patient is indicated (2). Many patients are anxious or agitated and may repeatedly ask questions concerning transpiring events. In the neurologic examination only disturbed memory can be found (3). Upon mental status examination, language function is preserved, which indicates a preservation of semantic and syntax memory. Attention is spared, visual-spatial skills are intact, and social skills are retained. Symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. As the syndrome resolves, the amnesia improves, but the patient may be left with a distinct lapse of recollection for events during the attack. The patient’s behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about his/her immediate circumstances (e.g., “What am I doing here?”; “How did we get here?”) (4). Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most potent effects on shortterm episodic and working memory in humans (5). Marijuana is used by inhalation in cigars or taken orally. When it is taken by the oral route its effects are seen in a delayed manner, so the inhalation type is used mostly to achieve the desired psychoactive effects (6). After al the cigar was burnt, the peak effects are seen in 20 minutes and disappear in 3 hours. A cigar of marijuana contains 5-20 mg THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Approximately 50% of the THC pass to the alveolar spaces. The most encountered psychotropic side effects of THC are; lethargy, sedation, euphoria, psychological relaxation, euphoria and sometimes, inhibition of the psychological inhibitions as alcohol does, disturbance in the perception of time and location (like feeling of delays in time and elongation of the distances), disturbance in the Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) has been a well-described phenomenon for more than 40 years. It presents with a paroxysmal, transient loss of memory. Immediate recall ability and remote memory are preserved. However, patiens experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. In some cases, the degree of retrograde memory loss is mild. Marijuana induced transient global amnesia is a rare side effect. Here, we present a case of memory loss for a short period of time after use of marijuana. (JAEM 2012; 11: 190-2)",

As noted in Chapter 1, dysfunction of the human mind results in symptoms in three primary spheres: thinking (cognition), emotion (meaning), and motivation (ability to set and achieve goals). These disorders can also produce a variety of physical (or “neurovegetative”) symptoms that include changes in appetite, sleep, sexual function, and energy level, among others. Some people develop symptoms suggestive of other medical or neurological disorders, such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, pain, and memory disturbances. Additionally, patients with serious medical and neurological disorders can develop psychiatric disorders (e.g., people with diabetes are prone to develop depression), with adverse effects likely affecting the outcome of both conditions.",

Cortical blindness follows bilateral occipital cortex damage, typically vascular. Deficits of verbal, visual and topographical memory become evident early in many dementias. Amnesias are common following a traumatic brain injury. Paramnesias are false or distorted recall – seen in acute confusional states or in dementia. Hallucinations are perceptual experiences without an external sensory stimulus – in other words, people see objects that are not there, hear voices, or believe there is a smell. Breakdown in speech production occurs in many dementias, such as motor neurone disease with dementia. Many find the classification of speech disorders difficult. Language competency depends on a discrete set of abilities: sensory decoding of the spoken message, appreciation of meaning, the capacity for repetition, and production of correctly articulated and correct speech.",

In fact, adolescent sleep problems commonly co-occur with depression and anxiety, and likely share complex bidirectional relationships over time. Evidence indicates that sleep problems, particularly insomnia, often precede the emergence of the onset of depression in adolescents, and may mediate the sequential comorbidity between anxiety and depression. An important future direction is to explore sleep improvement interventions tailored to the unique developmental needs of adolescents, which may represent a novel approach to prevent adolescent onset mental disorders.",

Daytime sleepiness is a typical complaint of sleep apnea patients and has generally been thought to result from the repeated arousals during nighttime sleep that are necessary to breathe, i.e., nighttime sleep of apneic patients is fragmented and not refreshing. Although the daytime sleepiness can occur at any time of the day, it most commonly occurs during the afternoon or early evening. The observation that naps do not usually provide relief from feelings of daytime sleepiness suggests that factors other than nighttime sleep fragmentation may be involved. In this chapter, we ﬁrst brieﬂy review data indicating that cytokines are involved in sleep regulation. We then present evidence that some effects of sleep apnea may include alterations in cytokine proﬁles. Finally, we conclude by speculating that alterations in cytokine concentrations/proﬁles may be one of several causal factors of the daytime sleepiness typically associated with sleep apnea.",

This at least is the feeling of many professionals in the field of child development in Britain, who believe that in recent years they have been seeing more children with autistic spectrum disorders. Autism was first characterised in 1943 by Kanner,1 who described a group of children with an unusual pattern of behaviour present from birth or before 30 months. He called this “early infantile autism.” His essential criteria for diagnosis were social aloofness and elaborate repetitive routines.2 Subsequent epidemiological studies have shown that autism is not, as Kanner first thought, a unique and separate condition occurring in children of otherwise normal development but that it is closely related to a range of developmental disorders.3 4 These include Asperger's syndrome,5 a condition characterised by borderline or normal IQ; social isolation or naive, inappropriate social interaction; intensive interest in only one or two subjects; a narrow, repetitive life style; limited or inappropriate intonation and body language; and poor motor coordination.\n\nAutistic spectrum disorders share a triad of impaired social interaction, communication, and imagination, associated with a rigid, repetitive pattern of behaviour. Onset is usually at birth or during the first three years of life, but problems can begin later in childhood. The triad can be recognised at all levels of intelligence and can …",

On retiring to bed in the morning they fall asleep rapidly but are prematurely awakened by their circadian rhythm and exhibit severe sleepiness and reduced performance capacity. In connection with the morning shift the circadian psychophysiology makes it difficult to fall asleep as early as needed during the preceding night. Around 0400 to 0500, when the individuals should rise, they have difficulties awakening because of the sleep loss and the circadian rhythm, which at that point is at its lowest. Subsequently, day work is characterized by sleepiness and reduced performance. It should be emphasized that it does not seem possible to improve one's ability to adjust over time, even with permanent night work. Older age and \"morningness\" personality are related to higher than average problems in adjusting.",

      "title": "Autizam kod djece i mladih",
      "abstract": "Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects all aspects of the child's personality (communication, motor skills, behavior and learning). It was first described by American child psychiatrist Leo Kanner in 1943, stating the basic characteristics of autism that have not been substantially changed (the inability of the child to establish normal contacts with parents, children and other people in general, delayed speech development and use speech to uncommunicative manner; repetitive and stereotyped games and obsessive insistence on the respect of a certain order, lack of imagination, good mechanical memory and normal physical appearance). Autistic people, except for the above characteristics, also have some special abilities, i.e. talents (talents related to music, memory, math, art, etc.). Autism belongs to the category of pervasive developmental disorders. In this category are also included: autism in childhood, atypical autism, Rett's disorder, the other disintegrative disorders of childhood, hyperactivity disorder associated with mental retardation and stereotyped movements, Asperger's Syndrome, other developmental disorders in childhood and pervasive developmental disorder, unspecified. Although the diagnosis of autism is not easy, there are several ways that can help in the diagnosis, for example history, clinical presentation, observing the child in different situations, psychological testing and various psychometric instruments. It is still not entirely clear what causes autism. As possible causes some authors suggest damage of the central nervous system, genetics, brain damage and disruption mirror neurons. Boys usually suffers of autism than girls. The most common is Kannerov syndrome, and disintegrative psychosis appears rarely. There are various therapeutic procedures and methods for people with autism, some of them are: behavioral therapy, music therapy, art therapy, play therapy, kinetic therapy, holding therapy, daily life therapy, sensory integration, different institutions, drugs, etc. As well as children with autism, their parents also need professional help. Education of children with autism should be based on respect for individual needs and differences of students. The prognosis for people with autism depends on the intellectual functioning, the development of speech and on the severity of characteristic symptoms of autism. The charter for the rights of people with autism was released at the Congress of autism in The Hague in 1992 in which was especially emphasized their right to free and full lives to the limit of their potential. The aim of this diploma thesis is to introduce some basic features and characteristics of autism.",

      "title": "Utilizing Multi-Class Classification Methods for Automated Sleep Disorder Prediction",
      "abstract": "Even from infancy, a human’s day-life alternates from a period of wakefulness to a period of sleep at night, during the 24-hour cycle. Sleep is a normal process necessary for human physical and mental health. A lack of sleep makes it difficult to control emotions and behaviour, reduces productivity at work, and can even increase stress or depression. In addition, poor sleep affects health; when sleep is insufficient, the chances of developing serious diseases greatly increase. Researchers in sleep medicine have identified an extensive list of sleep disorders, and thus leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate their analysis and gain a deeper understanding of sleep patterns and related disorders. In this research, we seek a Machine Learning (ML) solution that will allow for efficient classification of unlabeled instances as being Sleep Apnea, Insomnia or Normal (subjects without a specific sleep disorder) by assessing the performance of two well-established strategies for multi-class classification tasks: the One-Vs-All (OVA) and One-Vs-One (OVO). In the context of the specific strategies, two well-known binary classification models were assumed, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Both strategies’ validity was verified upon a dataset of diverse information related to the profiles (anthropometric data, sleep metrics, lifestyle and cardiovascular health factors) of potential patients or individuals not exhibiting any specific sleep disorder. Performance evaluation was carried out by comparing the weighted average results in all involved classes that represent these two specific sleep disorders and no-disorder occurrence; accuracy, kappa score, precision, recall, f-measure, and Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) were recorded and compared to identify an effective and robust model and strategy, both class-wise and on average. The experimental evaluation unveiled that after feature selection, 2-degree polynomial SVM under both strategies was the least complex and most efficient, recording an accuracy of 91.44%, a kappa score of 84.97%, precision, recall and f-measure equal to 0.914, and an AUC of 0.927.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by two or more years of recurrent and intermittent mood episodes in which the individual oscillates or “cycles” between periods of depression and hypomania, with or without normal periods interspersed between the depressive and hypomanic states. Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

      "title": "Sleep disorders in neurology",
      "abstract": "Sleep medicine is relevant in both neurology and general medicine. A disordered sleep–wake cycle can have major effects on many common neurological complaints such as headache and epilepsy, and it may also directly affect important general health issues, such as blood pressure. Furthermore, sleep related disorders such as parasomnias, particularly with agitation, can be hazardous to patients and bed partners while also being diagnostic clues in some neurodegenerative diseases. The traditional view that sleep is simply the absence of wakefulness has been increasingly refined over the past 50 years or so. Rather, it is a precisely orchestrated and complex state with distinct and mutually exclusive phases: non-rapid eye movement (stages 1–4) and rapid eye movement sleep (non-REM and REM sleep, respectively), defined largely by the surface EEG. In a typical night, there are 4–5 cycles of non-REM and REM sleep (figure 1). In REM sleep, the cortical EEG is highly activated in common with wakefulness, usually corresponding to the vivid dreaming that accompanies REM sleep. REM sleep periods predominate towards the end of the nocturnal sleep period whereas the deepest stages of non-REM sleep (stages 3 and 4) tend to occur within an hour of sleep onset. Figure 1 (A) EEG waveforms that define wake and non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep stages. (B) An idealised hypnogram summarising the distribution of the sleep stages through a typical night. Black bars refer to REM sleep during which the EEG pattern returns to that seen in wakefulness. Given the normal variation in sleep patterns and habits between people, distinguishing whether or not a sleep related symptom suggests a formal disorder can be difficult. It is a salutary fact that normal ageing is associated with deteriorating and poorly consolidated nocturnal sleep.",

      "abstract": "Hearing loss relates to missing certain sounds. The problem is certain sounds in the hearing nerve in our brain don’t get enough stimulation. The nerves need stimulation. When it is not stimulated the nerve stops working. When the nerve stops working, there arises complexity in our hearing nerves, which processes sounds that we hear. Similar to exercising which we do to keep your body healthy, our ears also need to hear sounds and recognize them to function at its best. So, the longer waiting time prior to hearing aids purchase, or to wear them, the less stimulation the brain and hearing nerves get. The speech recognition becomes worsen. Studies by WHO shows that nearly 40% of the age group in between age group 55-74 yrs (McCormack A. &amp; Fortnum H., May2013) suffers from this type of problem. If we compare with vision impairment Hearing Impairment users do not take this matter quite seriously. The problem of Hearing Loss is not only restricted to senior citizens but all age groups. Once the nerve is affected, there is no way to reverse the damage. There are also other side effects of not wearing Hearing aids. These include higher risk of cognitive decline, forgetfulness, depression, low performance at work leading to income, less productivity and the list goes on. The factors which responsible for non acceptance are not single but rather they are multi faced. Starting from financial problems, Physical looks, Perception, discomfort, are some of the few reasons. In this paper has tried to identify the factors which are responsible for this challenge. There needs to be further research and findings which can provide more factors responsible. Major studies in this field in the near future can identify many other factors which are even date beyond our knowledge",

Dalam istilah medis enuresis adalah istilah untuk anak yang mengompol minimal dua kali dalam seminggu dalam periode paling sedikit 3 bulan pada anak usia 5 tahun atau lebih, yang tidak disebabkan oleh efek obat-obatan. Dari beberapa penelitian didapatkan kondisi enuresis terjadi pada usia 5 tahun, pada usia tersebut didapatkan angka enuresis sekitar 10-15% dimana anak masih mengompol paling tidak satu kali dalam seminggu. Kondisi enuresis pada anak tersebut dapat dipengaruhi oleh beberapa faktor diantaranya peningkatan volume urin, ketidakmampuan untuk bangun dan menahan berkemih saat kandung kemih penuh. Kondisi Enuresis dapat memberikan dampak terhadap perkembangan anak secara fisik maupun psikis, diantaranya akibat dari enuresis ini anak akan mengalami gangguan perilaku baik dari sisi internal ataupun eksternal. Adapun penanganan kondisi enuresis didasarkan pada 4 prinsip diantaranya adalah peningkatan motivasi dari anak, pengaturan perilaku dari anak, penggunaan enuresis alarm, dan farmakoterapi jika semua kondisi non farmakoterapi sudah dilakukan. Tatalaksana yang berhasil melibatkan intervensi yang berkelanjutan terhadap faktor-faktor pencetus kondisi enuresis tersebut. Kata kunci: Anak-Anak, Enuresis,Talaksana",

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the situation and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Often patients have more than one specific phobia. Children may be less able to spontaneously articulate their fears and the presenting symptoms may include nonspecific behaviors such as crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging. A specific phobia can be distinguished from a developmentally appropriate fear by the persistence, severity, and degree of associated functional impairment. The treatment of choice for specific phobia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure therapy and systematic desensitization.",

The four most important sleep disorders which can be accompanied by sleeplessness in relatively healthy elderly people are periodic leg movements disorder (PLM), restless legs syndrome (RLS), REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and sleep apnea syndrome (SAS). Of these disorders, sleep apnea and periodic leg movements occur most frequently, in a quarter of the elderly. The latter, however, seldom complain about sleeplessness. Within the category of older people disorders characterized by movements during sleep increase significantly with age, nightly respiration disorders do not. SAS, PLM and RBD appear most frequently in men and RLS in women. The disorders characterized by movements during sleep (especially RLS and RBD) are often accompanied by sleeplessness. SAS, however, is more closely associated with day-time sleepiness than with sleeplessness. No combination of demographic variables and symptoms allows a reliable prediction of these sleep disorders. Fortunately, these disorders are not a major threat to the health of older people.",

Physiological changes are minimal during moderate sleep loss, but mood changes are clearly noticeable. The most likely sleep problems for aircrew members are those associated with disruption of sleep- wakefulness cycles and partial sleep loss. Consistent performance decrement is difficult to find, but marked increase in fatigue is a common problem. Sleep loss, both total and partial, tends to potentiate the circadian influence on performance and interact with other stressors to enhance the stress-induced physiological responses. Deprivation of sleep stage REM or sleep stage 4 produces no behavioral changes supportive of earlier beliefs that these two stages, especially stage REM, were necessary for effective waking behavior.",

The sleeping brain does fail and this failure is manifest in a variety of clinical symptoms; all sleep complaints should be taken seriously and investigated. Transient insomnia is uniformly associated with objective sleep disturbances which have been documented following phase shifts of the major sleep period such as that caused by transmeridian travel. However, the degree to which the individual responds to these factors is variable. There is a consensus that sleep medications are indicated for transient and short-term insomnia.

      "abstract": "The association of a constellation of sleep disturbances in adults with major depressive episodes is perhaps the most robust and widely replicated abnormality in psychobiological studies of psychiatric disorders. Reduced sleep efficiency, deficits of slow wave sleep (SWS), reduced latency to the first rapid eye movement (REM) period, an increase of REM sleep time, and increased density of rapid eye movements (REMD) during REM sleep are strongly associated with depressive illness in most samples (Benca, Obermeyer, Thisted, & Gillin, 1992). Studies of children, adolescents, and young adults with major depressive episodes find similar sleep disruptions, although only partially expressed relative to findings in adults. As Table 15.1 summarizes, certain studies of adolescents with major depression have reported increased REM density, reduced sleep latency, increased time to sleep onset, and increased arousals, whereas others have found mixed results or no differences with nondepressed controls. Even in adults, the specificity of the association of disturbed sleep parameters with the state of depression has been questioned (Benca, Obermeyer, Thisted, & Gillin, 1992). In general, however, the changes in sleep macroarchitecture have been strongly connected to core features of depressive illness and likely parallel aspects of the underlying pathophysiology of severe depression.",

During the eight years of illness, the patient suffered from polymorfic psychotic states accompanied by various types of epileptic seizures, including absence and grand-mal seizures, resistant to drug therapy. In addition, he suffered from multiple motor disorders, skeletal and mimiс muscle atrophy, as well as progressive cognitive decline from very high level of cognitive functions to level of moderate deterioration. Despite repeated evaluations, there was no unequivocal diagnosis of his disorder. Objectives Male, born in 1994, without a known hereditary pathology in the field of neurology or psychiatry. Pregnancy and childbirth proceeded without features and the early stages of cognitive-motor development were marked as normative, with the exception of a single epileptic seizure at the age of 3 years (according to the description of the parents). Until the age of 16, the patient was not under the supervision of a neurologist or psychiatrist, developed on a par with his peers, successfully attended school with high marks in the exact sciences, and went in for sports.

      "abstract": "Typologies of sleep problems have usually relied on identifying underlying causes or symptom clusters. In this study the value of using the patient's own reasons for sleep disturbance are explored. Using secondary data analysis of a nationally representative psychiatric survey the patterning of the various reasons respondents provided for self-reported sleep problems were examined. Over two thirds (69.3%) of respondents could identify a specific reason for their sleep problem with worry (37.9%) and illness (20.1%) representing the most commonly reported reasons. And while women reported more sleep problems for almost every reason compared with men, the patterning of reasons by age showed marked variability. Sleep problem symptoms such as difficulty getting to sleep or waking early also showed variability by different reasons as did the association with major correlates such as worry, depression, anxiety and poor health. While prevalence surveys of 'insomnia' or 'poor sleep' often assume the identification of an underlying homogeneous construct there may be grounds for recognising the existence of different sleep problem types particularly in the context of the patient's perceived reason for the problem.",

In a meta-analysis of 177 studies, Benca and colleagues (1992) reported that individuals with an anxiery disorder take longer ro get to sleep at the beginning of the night, experience more awakenings during rhe night, obtain less sleep overall, and exhibit poorer sleep efficienry, relative to nonpatients. More recently, a review of dre literature by Papadimitriou and Linkowski 2005) suggesrs rhat the major findings reported bv Benca et al. have held over the ensuing decade. \\,foreover, Papadimitriou and Linkowski (2005) tbund an especially strong association beween sleep disturbance and several anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, generalized anxiery disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Afthough -ort of the evidence to date is based on samples of aduhs in their rriddle years, there is also evidence ofan association )erween sleep disturbance and anxiety disorders in ;hildren and adolescence (Forbes et al., 2006), as well as among older adults (Spira, Friedman, Flint, & Sheikh,2005). The first aim of this chapter is to highlight the potential importance of sleep problems in individuals with anxiery disorders. W'e argue that disturbed sleep not only impairs the qualiry of a patientt life but may also contribute to rhe maintenance of the anxiety disorder. Our second aim is to review the evidence base for rrearing parienrs who sufFer from comorbid sleep disturbance and anxiery disorder. As will become evident throughout the chapter, there is a dearth of evidence that specifically delineates the relationship berween sleep disturbance and anxiery disorder and thus several ofour proposals are based on evidence from healthy nonpatients or patienrs with other clinical disorders. 'We raise this caveat at the outset as an importanr limitarion to rhe conclusions that we draw. 'We rurn now to begin this chapter by offering an overview of concepts that are basic to understanding human sleep; this knowledge is important for clinicians rreating individuals who sufFer from sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbances in the form of insomnia, nightmares, or nocrurnal panic attack are prominenr features across the anxiety disorders.The first aim ofthis chapter is to highlight rhe potential importance of sleep in individuals with anxiety disorders. lt is argued ttrat steep is important not only because disturbed sleep impairs the quality of a patient's life, but also because it likely contributes to the maintenance of the anxiety disorder.

Frequent nocturnal awakening and associated behavioral and psychological symptoms in demented people place a heavy burden on their families and care givers, and the development of an effective therapy is an important concern to health care practitioner and researchers. Although sleep disturbances in demented people could be classified into not only insomnia type but also irregular pattern type, differentiation has not yet been sufficiently practiced in a clinical setting. Demented people with irregular sleep pattern increase with progressive stage and are often insensitive to the usual pharmacotherapies for insomnia using benzodiazepines or antipsychotics. From the viewpoint of risk-benefit balance, chronotherapies such as artificial bright light or improvement of sleep hygiene could be useful and safety tools for sleep and behavioral problems in the demented elderly.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorder in the elderly is twice as common as dementia and four to six times more common than major depression. Anxiety is associated with poorer quality of life, significant distress and contributes to the onset of disability. Mortality risks are also increased, through physical causes, especially cardiovascular disease, and suicide. Diagnosing anxiety disorders in older adults remains a challenge because of the significant overlap in symptoms between physical disorders (shortness of breath; abdominal and chest pain; palpitations) and depression (disturbed sleep; poor attention, concentration and memory; restlessness). Good history taking is crucial in elucidating whether the complaint is of new onset or a recurrence of a previous disorder. The presence of comorbid depression should be clarified. If present, its temporal relationship with the anxiety symptoms will indicate whether there is an independent anxiety disorder. A medication review is warranted, as a number of drugs may be causative (calcium channel blockers, alpha- and beta-blockers, digoxin, L-thyroxine, bronchodilators, steroids, theophylline, antihistamines) or may cause anxiety in withdrawal (e.g. benzodiazepines). Substance and alcohol abuse should be excluded, as withdrawal from either may cause anxiety. A new or exacerbated physical illness may be related to anxiety. Medical investigations will help clarify the extent to which a particular somatic symptom is the result of anxiety.",

The standardised mortality rate in all patients with an epilepsy is between 1.6 and 4.1 but considerably higher (up to 10) in those with a medically-refractory epilepsy and with additional childhood-onset comorbid problems including learning difficulties and severe four-limb spastic cerebral palsy. Mortality in epilepsy may be seizure-related (eg, resulting in an accident, including submersion1 or in convulsive status epilepticus) or associated with an underlying neurological disorder. Only a few of the factors associated with the increased mortality risk are outside the patient’s (or the family’s, in the case of children) control and largely non-preventable, notably sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and complications of the underlying neurological disorder responsible for the epilepsy. Most other factors are under some degree of control, which, although not certain to prevent premature death, may substantially reduce the risk. These include the optimisation of seizure control to prevent or at least reduce the risk of frequent tonic-clonic or tonic seizures, the recognition and appropriate management of convulsive status epilepticus and the provision of appropriate advice and action on safety and lifestyle; the latter includes specific advice on water-related activities, both in and outside the home.\n\nThe retrospective study by Franklin et al 2 identified epilepsy as a risk factor in childhood drowning deaths, with a prevalence of 4.1% of drowning fatalities, compared with 0.7%–1.7% among the general, 0–14 years population (relative risk: 2.4–5.8).

Non-rapid eye movement sleep promotes epileptic activity, while rapid eye movement sleep suppresses it. Seizures can be triggered by sleep, while sleep deprivation increases seizure susceptibility. Epilepsy disrupts sleep architecture and quality, leading to sleep disturbances and comorbidities, like sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. Excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue can result from epilepsy and the sedating effects of antiseizure medications. Sleep-related epilepsy exhibits seizures predominantly during sleep, with specific patterns related to sleep stages. Antiseizure medications can directly impact sleep quality and should be carefully considered when treating epilepsy patients with comorbid sleep disorders. Understanding the bidirectional relationship between sleep and epilepsy is crucial for effective management. Optimizing treatment strategies requires recognizing the effects of antiseizure medications on sleep, and addressing sleep-related issues in individuals with epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Increased daytime sleepiness is an important symptom of disturbed night sleep, which should not be neglected. Hypersomnia reduces the quality of life, complicates socialization, can provoke insomnia, impulsive behaviour, and even depression or suicidal tendencies. The causes of increased daytime sleepiness may be non-compliance with sleep hygiene, nighttime sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, etc.). If these conditions are excluded, you need to pay attention to rare forms of sleep pathology included in the group of central hypersomnia. Aim of the review: to determine the prevalence, pathogenesis, clinic, diagnosis, and treatment of hypersomnia in children. Among the central hypersomnia, narcolepsy is more common than the rest in the population. Idiopathic hypersomnia and Kleine-Levin syndrome are more rare forms of pathology. The pathogenesis of central hypersomnia has not yet been sufficiently studied, disorders of the immune system are of key importance, but there may be other causes. The leading clinical manifestation is daytime sleepiness, which worsens the child’s quality of life. In the diagnosis of hypersomnia, polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MTLS) are of key importance, in some cases other diagnostic methods (MRI) should be used. Pharmacotherapy relieves the condition in sick children, but does not completely eliminate the symptoms. New medicines are being developed. Treatment of hypertension should be comprehensive, not limited to drug therapy.",

      "title": "Human Physiological Models of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Relatively little is known about the neurobiology of insomnia, despite its wide prevalence and broad medical impact. Although much is still to be learned about the pathophysiology of the disorder, identification, systematic assessment, and appropriate treatment are clearly beneficial to patients. Recent research, using quantitative EEG, polysomnography (PSG), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and neuroimaging techniques, suggests that some broad areas can be identified as possible pathophysiological models. Sleep-wake homeostat model hypothesizes a failure in homeostatic regulation of sleep, an attenuated increase in sleep drive with time awake, and/or defective sensing of sleep need. Circadian clock model hypothesizes a dysfunctional circadian clock, resulting in changes in the timing of sleep-wake propensity that are incompatible with normal sleep. Intrinsic sleep-wake state mechanism model suggests that abnormal function of insomnia comprises the systems responsible for expression of the sleep states themselves. Extrinsic over-ride mechanism (stress-response) model suggests that insomnia reflects the consequences of overactivity of one of the systems considered extrinsic to normal sleep-wake control. Many current therapies for insomnia are based on these physiological models. Several attempts have been made to create a physiological model that would explain this disorder and could be used as a foundation for treatment. However, it appeared that no model can fully explain and clarify all aspects of insomnia. Future research should be necessary to expand our knowledge on the biological dimensions of insomnia.",

La présence d'une activité alpha-delta, de micro-éveils et de complexes K-alpha, témoins d'une fragmentation du sommeil, correspondent à une possible intrusion de l'éveil dans le sommeil et peuvent ainsi contribuer à l'altération de la fonction restauratrice du sommeil et ainsi expliquer en partie la symptomatologie diurne de ces patients.

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies indicate that the increasing worldwide prevalence of chronic pain may be as high as 20-50 %. Furthermore, chronic pain is strongly associated with psychiatric comorbidities, and in particular, anxiety, depression and insomnia. Accordingly, pain is associated with decrements of many aspects of patient's lives including physical and emotional functioning, affective symptoms and sleep problems. The negative impact is higher in patients with greater pain severity. However, there is a bidirectional relationship between chronic pain and these symptoms. Patients with somatisation, health-seeking behaviours and poor sleep are at high risk of developing chronic widespread pain. The risk increases in tandem with severity of anxiety, depression or sleep problems, and those with multiple predisposing factors are at the highest risk (Figure 1)\nTherefore, clinically, it may be prudent to consider pain, sleep problems and anxiety/depression as co-existent components of a triad, where the presence of symptoms of one component should prompt investigation for the others.",

A video-polysomnography revealed periodic leg movements (figure) and arousal followed by sleep episodes while standing, rhythmic marching, and falling (videos 1 and 2 on the Neurology ® Web site at [Neurology.org][1]). A reevaluation of his history revealed symptoms compatible with restless legs syndrome (RLS). Rotigotine1 proved very effective, supporting the diagnosis of RLS. Periodic leg movement disorder leading to sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder could also be considered. Automatic behavior denotes severe sleep deprivation2 and may represent a non-REM parasomnia. Severe RLS may present with automatic behavior complicating its diagnosis.

REM sleep also is referred to as paradoxical sleep, because the brain paradoxically seems to be in an activated state that is similar to, but not identical to, the waking state. REM sleep is characterized by an activated electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (low‐voltage, fast‐frequency brain waves), muscular paralysis (with the exception of diaphragmatic and ocular muscles), periodic bursts of rapid eye movements, and autonomic nervous system instability (e.g., variable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration).

There is rupture with customary situation of the elder which hold a plurality of risk factors. These confusional disorders increase with aging and cognitive impairment. Late life delusional subject has also persecutory ideation without dissociation but with emotional reactions and affective changes. Different factors promote birth of late life delusion (personality features, isolation, sensory defect...). On psychodynamic way, these two disorders are issued from a breakdown followed by a more or less durable appointment. Confusion agrees with a somatic and psychic regression (consciousness disorganization). This is an elder's attempt to prevent anxiety. Late life delusion lays on denial and projective mecanisms. It is jointed with prejudice and intrusion (with regard to ownership, health and reputation). This is an elder's attempt to establish defences against depression.

Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

The average hurried and perfunctory note is only a little better than no note at all. 4. Conclusions without a statement of facts are misleading. Terms such as rambling, confused and violent should be used very cautiously in the primary case record. 5. Undiagnosed cases should be represented as often as new facts discovered will warrant. 6. In a considerable percentage of undiagnosed cases, disagreement and hesitation upon the part of the staff indicate, though oftentimes unwittingly, a good prognosis. 7. Confusion and apprehension in an acute psychosis would seem to indicate dementia præcox more often than any other disorder. 8. The absence of definite hallucinosis in a case otherwise doubtful contributes to failure in classification. 9. There are depressions of psychogenic origin that are not manic-depressive in nature and these types often occur between the ages of 40 and 60 with recovery. 10. The senile-presenile state is uncertain ground. A return should be made to the Kraepelinian presenile grouping. 11.

      "abstract": "Sleep-wake and circadian rhythm disturbances are common in remitted bipolar disorder. These disturbances include difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, daytime sleepiness, sleep irregularity, and a circadian tendency toward eveningness. To date, few studies have examined the impact of eveningness on impairments in remitted bipolar disorder. Ninety-eight adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder I, II, or not otherwise specified were evaluated. Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that eveningness was associated with greater sleep-wake disturbances, more unhealthy dietary habits, worse quality of life, more impaired interpersonal relationships, and more dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions and behaviors, controlling for age, gender, and years of education. Targeted intervention on dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions and behaviors may reverse eveningness and improve functioning in bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Significance of REM Sleep in Depression: Effects on Neurogenesis",
      "abstract": "Disturbances of sleep are typical of depression and are observed in between 50% and 90% of depressed subjects [1]. Most patients with depression complain of insomnia and have well-described sleep disruptions, which belong to the core symptoms of the disorder [2]. Sleep disorders in depression have stimulated many sleep studies and for many decades sleep research has been a major pillar of neurobiological investigations into depression’s cause, onset and course. Since 1960s polysomnographic sleep research has demonstrated that besides disturbances of sleep continuity a constellation of sleep EEG changes is present in depression [3,4]. Especially Rapid Eye Movement activity has been the favorite focus of sleep EEG studies in depression and studies on its significance indicate that a strong link exists between dysregulation of REM sleep, REM latency, REM density, and the cause, onset and course of major depressive disorders. These alterations might act as trait dependent marker of depression and have been considered biological marker for depression. Especially shortened REM sleep Latency might be both a prodrome of major depressive episodes [2] and a consequence or complication of depression [2,5]. In fact REM alterations often persist beyond the clinical episode indicating heightened vulnerability to depressive relapse or recurrence, negative affecting treatment response independent of treatment method [2,6]. Moreover because the majority of antidepressant irrespective of their chemical class suppress REM sleep, it has been hypothesized that REM sleep suppression might be considered a key mechanism underlying treatment response and might be considered necessary if an antidepressant effect is obtained. Recently REM deregulations have been described to have a role in the production of the core symptoms of mood disorder contributing to the core features of cognitive distortion including self-worth [7] and to negative emotional memories consolidation. Studies have in fact demonstrated that there is a failure of sleep dependent emotional brain processing in REM sleep in depression which seems to support the development of clinical depression [8]. In addition, REM sleep is physiologically abnormal in persons at risk for depression. In fact several high risk studies including healthy relatives of patients with depression have demonstrated that REM sleep, particularly REM density changes, are present before the disorder’s onset and predict its development.Several theoretical models have been developed to explain REM sleep abnormalities in depression and they might be implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. Indeed Circardian Rhytm abnormalities have been hypothesized to explain REM sleep abnormalities in depression i.e. the Two Process Model, “S-deficiency” [9] the “Phase-advance” hypothesis [10], genetically driven [11] and the “hypocretine deficit hypothesis” [12], REM sleep dysregualtion have been historically posed as a causal process of depression [13]. In fact the “Monoamine Hypothesis,”ACh-hypersensitivity” in depression indicate a key role of REM sleep dysregualtions as specific features of this disorder due to cholinergic hyperactivity [14] which might be under genetic control. More recently REM sleep dysregulation have been hypothesized to contribute to neurometabolic alterations in depression. Recently McNamara et al. [7] suggest that one proximate mechanism that does directly yield the pathophysiologic pattern of hyperactive paralimbic/ ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC) and hypoactive dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dPFC) in mood disorders might be “REM hyperactivation or dis-inhibition” driven. A key role of REM sleep alterations in the pathogenesis of depression have been also indicated within the defect of brain maturation hypothesis. A novel concept for the etiology of depression proposes that a dysfunction of neural plasticity might represent a final common pathway underlying the biological and clinical characteristics of the disorder. Changes in neurogenesis might be linked to the pathophysiology of depression. In fact a decrease in neurogenesis has been shown in animal models of depression, and shift in brain plasticity might be stress related [15]. Recently it has been hypothesized that one mechanism that does directly yield the pathophysiologic pattern in mood disorders affecting neurogenesis is stress-related REM hyperactivation or dis-inhibition [16,17]. Moreover available data favor the hypothesis that the increase of stress hormones, due to sleep loss of depression and REM-stress related affects adult neurogenesis and it may endanger hippocampal integrity [18], thereby leading to cognitive dysfunction and contributing to the development of mood disorders (allostatic load) [16,17]. REM sleep changes in depression might be under a genetic control and are mediated by complex neurobiological modifications that involves noradrenergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic systems and the stress system which might affect adult neurogenesis and brain plasticity. Recently REM sleep alterations have been considered not only biological scars but true endophenotypes for depression [4,19]. In fact in the search of new “vulnerability markers” or “endophenotypes” for depression changes during the REM sleep period have been reconsidered of potential interest.Concluding form historical studies to more recent ones we might hypothesized that REM sleep might play an important key role in depression onset, course, cognitive emotional symptoms, expression and treatment response. Moreover REM sleep dysregulation might contribute to neurometabolic alterations in depression and are involved in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders. Especially it seems that REM sleep changes in depression might be under a genetic control and are mediated by host of genetic, neurochemical and neurobiological factors which might affect neurogenesis and brain plasticity of depressed patients. For all these evidences in the search of new “endophenotypes” changes during the REM sleep period have been reconsidered of potential interest. Clearly REM sleep dramatically modulates physiological, emotional and cognitive states of the human",

      "title": "Neuroticism is a fundamental domain of personality with enormous public health implications",
      "abstract": "Neuroticism is the trait disposition to experience negative affects, including anger, anxiety, self-consciousness, irritability, emotional instability, and depression1. Persons with elevated levels of neuroticism respond poorly to environmental stress, interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and can experience minor frustrations as hopelessly overwhelming. Neuroticism is one of the more well established and empirically validated personality trait domains, with a substantial body of research to support its heritability, childhood antecedents, temporal stability across the life span, and universal presence1, 2. Neuroticism has enormous public health implications3. It provides a dispositional vulnerability for a wide array of different forms of psychopathology, including anxiety, mood, substance, somatic symptom, and eating disorders1, 4. Many instances of maladaptive substance use are efforts to quell or quash the dismay, anxiousness, dysphoria, and emotional instability of neuroticism. Clinically significant episodes of anxiety and depressed mood states will often represent an interaction of the trait or temperament of neuroticism with a life stressor1. Neuroticism is comparably associated with a wide array of physical maladies, such as cardiac problems, disrupted immune functioning, asthma, atopic eczema, irritable bowel syndrome, and even increased risk for mortality2. The relationship of neuroticism to physical problems is both direct and indirect, in that neuroticism provides a vulnerability for the development of these conditions, as well as a disposition to exaggerate their importance and a failure to respond effectively to their treatment. Neuroticism is also associated with a diminished quality of life, including feelings of ill-will, excessive worry, occupational failure, and marital dissatisfaction5. High levels of neuroticism will contribute to poor work performance due to emotional preoccupation, exhaustion, and distraction. Similar to the duel-edged effect of neuroticism on physical conditions, high levels of neuroticism will result in actual impairment to marital relationships but also subjective feelings of marital dissatisfaction even when there is no objective basis for such feelings, which can though in turn lead to actual spousal frustration and withdrawal. Given the contribution of neuroticism to so many negative life outcomes, it has been recommended that the general population be screened for clinically significant levels of neuroticism during routine medical visits1, 6. Screening in the absence of available treatment would be problematic. However, neuroticism is responsive to pharmacologic intervention1. Pharmacotherapy can and does effectively lower levels of the personality trait of neuroticism. Barlow et al7 have also developed an empirically-validated cognitive-behavioral treatment of neuroticism, called the Unified Protocol (UP). They have suggested that current psychological treatments have become overly specialized, focusing on disorder-specific symptoms. The UP was designed to be transdiagnostic. Recognizing the impact of neuroticism across a diverse array of physical and mental health care concerns, the authors of the UP again note that \"the public-health implications of directly treating and even preventing the development of neuroticism would be substantial\"7. Neuroticism has long been recognized since the beginning of basic science personality research and may even be the first domain of personality that was identified within psychology1. Given its central importance for so many different forms of mental and physical dysfunction, it is not surprising that neuroticism is evident within the predominant models of personality, personality disorder, and psychopathology. Neuroticism is one of the fundamental domains of general personality included within the five-factor model or Big Five2. It is also within the dimensional trait model included in Section III of the DSM-5 for emerging measures and models8. This trait model consists of five broad domains, including negative affectivity (along with detachment, psychoticism, antagonism, and disinhibition). As expressed in the DSM-5, \"these five broad domains are maladaptive variants of the five domains of the extensively validated and replicated personality model known as the 'Big Five' or Five Factor Model of personality\"8. Neuroticism is likewise aligned with the negative affective domain included within the dimensional trait model of personality disorder proposed for the ICD-119. Finally, it is also evident within the transdiagnostic Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of the National Institute of Mental Health, as RDoC negative valence encapsulates such constructs as fear, distress, frustration, and perceived loss10. It would be inaccurate to suggest that RDoC negative valence is equivalent to neuroticism, but it is self-evident that they are closely aligned. Currently, there is considerable interest in the general factors of psychopathology, personality disorder, and personality. To the extent that degree of impairment and dysfunction (which largely defines the general factors) is associated with level of distress and dismay, which is quite likely to be the case, we would propose that neuroticism will explain a substantial proportion of the variance in those general factors. In sum, neuroticism is a fundamental domain of personality that has enormous public health implications, impacting a wide array of psychopathological and physical health care concerns. It contributes to the occurrence of many significantly harmful life outcomes, as well as impairing the ability of persons to adequately address them. It has long been recognized as one of the more important and significant domains of personality and is being increasingly recognized as a fundamental domain of personality disorder and psychopathology more generally.

      "abstract": "The nervous system is commonly impacted by chemicals found in nature, elaborated by organisms, or synthesized by chemists. The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

      "title": "54 and Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "resilience, and engagement in life well into old age. The preservation of excellent-quality sleep into later life not only tells us how someone is actually doing but is also important with respect to continued successful adapta­ tion along both physical and psychosocial dimensions. 4•5 Second, sleep disorders are common in older adults (who take approximately 40% of prescribed sedative hypnotics in the United States) and, if recognized and diagnosed by chief complaints of or excessive sleepiness at inappropriate times of day, can usually be successfully treated or at least mitigated with respect to their adverse impact on the patient's quality of life and on caregiver strain and burden. (The latter consideration is particu­ larly important in the case of the frail elder on the cusp of long-term care placement, since sleep disturbance in the caregiver related to the patient's disruptive nocturnal behaviors may lead to institutionalization.) Even among patients in long-term care placement, including those with progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia of the Alzheimer type, sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are frequently amenable to effective intervention. Finally, the risk of not recognizing and ap­ propriately treating sleep disorders in later life needs to be understood. These risks include deterioration in the quality of life, the development of emotional problems such as depression, worsening of cognitive impairment, and complications of sleep disorders such as motor ve­ hicle accidents. Risk for mortality, also, may be adversely affected by too much sleep (i.e., greater than nine hours out of 24), possibly mediated by sleep apnea, or too little sleep (i.e., less than five hours out of 24) in late life, as epidemiologic data have shown.6 Thus, not only does the quality of sleep affect the quality of life, but also sleep can be, literally, a matter of life and death. Within this context, therefore, this chapter discusses the expected changes of sleep that occur in the elderly and addresses the issue of whether it is usual to sleep less or more as one ages. We will also discuss a definition of insomnia in the elderly, together with the key items in the history in the workup of the elderly individual who complains of insomnia. Indications for referral for formal sleep studies will be reviewed. We will discuss practical, nonpharmacologic approaches to the management of chronic in later life, as well as the role of psychoactive medications in the management of acute and chronic insomnia: Is there a benzodiazepine of choice? Does diphenhydramine have a role? What is the place of zolpidem? Common causes of excessive daytime sleepiness in the elderly, including sleep apnea, nar­ colepsy, and periodic limb movement disorder will be reviewed along with their treatment. Parasomnias, which commonly affect the elderly, are also reviewed. We will also consider the contexts of care, e.g., outpatient, home, and long-term care, where appropriate. This latter focus will include a summary of what is known about the changes of sleep that accompany dementing disorders, a discussion of when intervention is needed, and what in­ terventions are likely to be useful. Finally, we will incor­ porate our view of current research directions in this area, including a focus on what is known about the neural basis of sleep and its changes with aging. To enhance the clinical relevance of this chapter, we will conclude with a discussion of office-based screening and present illustra­ tive case studies.",

      "abstract": "Preterm labor is the main cause of infant mortality in advanced countries; babies born preterm are at higher risk for short-term and long-term complications, including physical disability and mental development. Due to severe neonatal complications often followed, preterm labor is a very serious problem. Some of these complications include respiratory distress syndrome, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, and necrotizing colitis , many of which might lead to the death of the infant. One of the major problems of preterm infants is the lack of adequate lung function and, consequently, respiratory distress, known as Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome . The most common reason for admission of preterm and term infants in hospitals is respiratory disease for special care. Respiratory distress syndrome is more prevalent in preterm infants, and its incidence is related to birth weight and intrauterine age. To paint a general picture, it is prevalent in infants of diabetic mothers, gestational age under 37 weeks, multiple pregnancy, the implementation of caesarean section, accelerated delivery and cold stress. It is most common in newborns. The main cause of respiratory distress syndrome in newborns is the lack of surfactant in the baby's lung. The main components of surfactant are lecithin (disalmotyl phosphatidyl choline), phosphatidyl glycerol, apoproteins (SP-A, B, C, D) and glycerol .With increased uterine age, more phospholipid is produced and stored in type 2 alveolar cells. These agents are released into the alveoli and reduce the surface tension and help prevent collapse of the small airway at the tail end and help rehabilitate the lung after exhalation; however, he amount that is produced and secreted may not be adequate to meet the premature baby's demand. At 20 weeks of pregnancy, surfactant is present with high concentrations in the lung tissue of the fetus, but it doesn't reaches the level of the lung alveoli; it appears in amniotic fluid between 28 and 32 weeks.",

Jednymi z najczęściej zgłaszanych przez pacjentów skarg, zwłaszcza w początkowym okresie realimentacji, są dolegliwości ze strony przewodu pokarmowego. Najczęściej objawy te są powiązane z zaburzeniami motoryki przewodu pokarmowego. Z dostępnych danych wynika, że aż połowa pacjentów chorujących na jadłowstręt psychiczny cierpi na istotne zaburzenia motoryki przewodu pokarmowego (niepełna relaksacja górnego i dolnego zwieracza przełyku, zaburzona podatność żołądka, opóźnione opróżnianie żołądka, wydłużenie pasażu jelitowego, osłabienie motoryki odbytnicy i odbytu). Zaburzenia te i dolegliwości ze strony przewodu pokarmowego mogą utrudniać przywrócenie prawidłowego sposobu odżywiania się, jeśli nie zostaną odpowiednio wcześnie wykryte i leczone. Istnieje stosunkowo niewiele badań dotyczących zaburzeń motoryki przewodu pokarmowego u pacjentów chorujących na jadłowstręt psychiczny, które nie odpowiadają jednoznacznie na pytanie czy zaburzenia te są pierwotne czy też wynikają z wyniszczenia oraz czy ustępują wraz z przywróceniem prawidłowej masy ciała. Brak odniesienia wyników badań naukowych do praktyki klinicznej, oraz brak standardów postępowania co do diagnostyki i leczenia zaburzeń przewodu pokarmowego u chorych na jadłowstręt psychiczny stanowi duży problem zarówno dla specjalistów w dziedzinie psychiatrii jak i gastroenterologii.",

To the clinical mind the term connotes a condition in which an alleged sleeplessness is the main or solitary symptom, in which there are few tangible physical causes and in which the pathologic basis, if any, is not readily detectable. A person who has genuine pain and whose physical derangements are such that sleep is obviously impossible is not ordinarily regarded as having insomnia. What constitutes true insomnia is largely a matter of capricious opinion on the part of both patient and physician. It would be of considerable advantage to determine whether there is a definite optimum of human sleep, that is, a basic requirement comparable to basal metabolism, from which deviations could be measured. Adult normal sleep defies standardization, for even the most regular of sleep rhythms must be regarded as a complex process which can be influenced by both physical and",

      "abstract": "Sleep and wake states involve interaction among many brain centers via multiple neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine, hypocretin, acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin (wake promoting), and γ amino butyric acid (GABA) and melatonin (sleep promoting). Most medications for insomnia or hypersomnia act on elements of these neural systems. Initial treatment of insomnia includes sleep hygiene measures. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is useful. Medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for insomnia act on GABA receptors or on melatonin receptors. A frequent cause of insomnia is restless legs syndrome, which is linked to reduced dopaminergic activity in brain structures; idiopathic restless legs syndrome is best treated with dopamine agonists such as ropinerole or pramipexole. Excessive daytime sleepiness is most often due to insufficient sleep hours or sleep apnea but is also caused by medications, illnesses, narcolepsy, or idiopathic hypersomnia. Stimulants generally act through enhanced dopamine action (amphetamines, methylphenidate) or acetylcholine action (caffeine). Modafinil may act through enhanced central histamine, hypocretin, and possibly dopamine action. A newer agent, γ -hydroxybutyrate (GHB), acts on GABA and GHB receptors to consolidate sleep, improving daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. Improving knowledge of sleep/wake mechanisms should lead to more specific and rational treatments for sleep disorders.",

It is defined by the presence of headache on 15 or more days a month, of which at least eight must meet the criteria of migraine without aura for a minimum of three months. In addition they must not be due to medication abuse or attributable to any other cause.The prevalence of chronic migraine ranges between 1-3% of the population and its incidence has been estimated to be 2.5% per year. It produces from four to six times more disability, decreased productivity and disruption of quality of life than episodic migraine. The development of chronic migraine has been associated with both non-modifiable risk factors (being female, low socio-economic status and level of schooling) and modifiable risk factors (anxiety, depression, sleep apnoea/snoring, obesity, consumption of painkillers and caffeine). Patients with chronic migraine suffer from chronic pain, anxiety or depression two to three times more often than those with episodic migraine. Management requires identification and control of the risk factors that predispose patients to develop the condition, detoxification therapy in the event of abuse of analgesics, specific treatment for migraine attacks and preventive treatment. The effectiveness of the preventive drugs topiramate and Onabotulinumtoxin A in this complication of migraine has been proved in large-scale placebo-controlled clinical trials.Chronic migraine is a common condition that requires global management aimed at reducing the frequency of the attacks, lowering the associated disability and improving the patients' quality of life.",

Cramps and improper breathing appear during speech. Stuttering is accompanied by physical symptoms that appear in stressful communication with the child. Stuttering is widespread in the world, and it originates from ancient times. First, it occurs between the second and third years of life, when speech develops intensively, but it may occur later. The cause of stuttering is explained by three theories: constitutional, developmental and environmental. The speech-language development of children is increasingly influenced by the media, which have become an important part of everyday life. There are more division of stuttering. The first division is on physiological, primary, secondary and acute / abrupt stuttering, while the other is psychogenic and neurogenic, which appear later in life. There are five stages of stuttering development, of which three stages appear during preschool age (developmental speech failure, border stinging, initial stuttering), stage during school age (transient stuttering) and stage during adolescence and further (advanced stuttering). Speech therapy is performed with the child - indirect and direct, before which diagnostic procedures are required. The child has fear of speaking and situations that require speaking, which affect his psychological state and selfconfidence. It is therefore important to provide support and encourage it in progress. A research was carried out to find out how often preschool teachers have interactions with a child who has a speech disorder and in cooperation with a therapist carries out speech excerises, how often do they cooperate with the child's parents and in which way those children included in working with other children. The results show that most preschool teachers do not consider themselves competent to work with children with a speech disorder, but they have cooperated with parents in every possible way. These children were daily involved in the work of the group that contributes to their further growth and development.",

These observations suggest that memory stores in senile dementia remain outside the destructive action of the senile atrophic process, in any case until the expressive speech is preserved. Storage of the information acquired before the appearance of the symptoms of dementia is unlikely to depend on the degree of its personality importance. Before it becomes strongly manifest, senile dementia does not prevent the stamping on the person's memory, at least of part of new information (possibly, of only emotionally significant). Such material may also be stored in the patients' memory even in case of pronounced dementia. Difficulties in active reproduction of the ideas available in memory stores can already be seen at the early stages, becoming more remarkable as the disease progresses.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are associated with a number of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders, and many psychiatric patients report symptoms such as insomnia, tiredness, fatigue, and excessive sleepiness. Despite their known negative impact on daytime functioning and quality of life, less than 10% of individuals with these symptoms visit physicians specifically for their sleeping problems. Although there are many explanations for this lack of reporting, one possibility is that individuals are often unaware of the impact of sleepiness on their daytime functioning. Therefore, the burden of identifying sleepiness and its consequences often resides with physicians and other health care professionals. This process of detection is assisted by rating scales and subjective and objective tests. Although prior discussions on these topics have focused on the understanding and identification of either excessive sleepiness or insomnia, these symptoms often coexist, introducing a clinical challenge in that it becomes unclear which of these two should become the initial focus of clinical attention. When both excessive sleepiness and insomnia coexist, a circadian rhythm sleep disorder may be present, such as jet lag type, delayed and advanced sleep phase types, and shift work type.",

The consequences include depressed mood, interpersonal irritability, decreased daytime vigilance, weight gain, coronary artery disease, and cognitive impairment (Kecklund and Axelsson 2016). Determining what amount of sleep is sufficient for an individual is difficult for several reasons. Sleep duration gradually decreases from a starting length of 16 hours per 24-hour day as human beings transition from infancy to adulthood. Interindividual differences in the optimal amount of sleep range from 6 to 12 hours, with a mean of 7.5 hours for adults. When a primary sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (OSAH), is present, the continuity and depth of sleep may be compromised independently of sleep duration. Recognizing how much sleep any individual requires is complicated. Nonetheless, there is consensus that chronically inadequate sleep is detrimental to health.",

      "title": "P288 Somatic complaints in anxiety disorders",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Conclusions of current state of the art report that 50% of all children and adolescents outpatient visits to a paediatrician are determined by a physical/somatic complaint. After medical evaluation, a third of these complaints have no apparent organic cause, thereby becoming a medically unexplained symptom. Somatic complaints have become a topic of research in child and adolescent psychiatric literature, as these are often correlated with anxiety disorders in this age category. Separation anxiety disorder, panic disorder or scholar phobia (scholar refusal) for which physical symptoms are a part of the <i>DSM</i> diagnostic criteria are associated with increased somatic complaints. The term school phobia was first used in 1941 to identify children who fail to attend school because attendance causes emotional distress and anxiety, but since the early 2000's the term school refusal is preferred. Children who refuse to attend school usually try to win a parent's permission to stay home, although some simply refuse to leave the house. In recent studies, the most commonly endorsed somatic symptoms in children and adolescent sample of school refusers were gastrointestinal items: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach pains. Another physical symptoms are common and include dizziness, headaches, shaking or trembling, fast heart rate, chest pains, and back, joint pains. These symptoms usually improve once the child is allowed to stay home. Behavioural symptoms include temper tantrums, crying, angry outbursts, and threats to hurt themselves. Usually, for parents, somatic symptoms outweigh the concerns, fears, and child's refusal to attend the tests or going to school, so parents repeatedly address the family doctor or paediatrician. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This paper aims to emphasise the importance of completing medical history and laboratory investigations with data that may suggest a psychogenic cause of somatic complaints. After excluding organic causes, it is important for paediatric patients to be oriented to mental health services for early intervention. This is important to delineate because the longer is the period of missing school the harder it is the educational reintegration. The long term consequences are unfavourable for the child including loss of peer relationships and academic difficulties.",

      "title": "Sleep Disturbances Associated with Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are common problems affecting the quality life of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and are often underestimated. The causes of sleep disturbances are multifactorial and include nocturnal motor disturbances, nocturia, depressive symptoms, and medication use. Comorbidity of PD with sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, or circadian cycle disruption also results in impaired sleep. In addition, the involvement of serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic neurons in the brainstem as a disease-related change contributes to impaired sleep structures. Excessive daytime sleepiness is not only secondary to nocturnal disturbances or dopaminergic medication but may also be due to independent mechanisms related to impairments in ascending arousal system and the orexin system. Notably, several recent lines of evidence suggest a strong link between rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. In the present paper, we review the current literature concerning sleep disorders in PD.",

      "title": "Melatonin Therapy of Pediatric Sleep Disorders: Recent Advances, Why it Works, Who are the Candidates and How to Treat",
      "abstract": "Chronic sleep difficulties commonly coexist with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric problems. Children with special needs may have a variety of sleep disturbances and of these circadian rhythm sleep disorders appear to be the most common. Melatonin supplementation for some circadian rhythm sleep disorders is often an effective treatment because it corrects the associated abnormal melatonin secretion. Melatonin has a benign safety profile and significant potential health benefits. Melatonin has many functions including sleep promoting and chronobiotic properties. Melatonin therapy is only beneficial when persistent sleep difficulties are associated with low melatonin secretion and additional supplementation beyond the therapeutic dose does not result in further sleep promotion. Abnormal neurological modulation of pineal melatonin secretion is commonly present in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Melatonin deficiency not only leads to sleep disturbance, but also to multiple health problems. Chronic sleep difficulties of special needs children must not be ignored because they may exacerbate the deficits in development which are already present. In this review, misconceptions about sleep and melatonin therapy, functions of this indoleamine, causes and diagnoses of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, physiological principles underlying treatment, selection of candidates, dose, safety and health benefits are discussed.

      "title": "Women and Excessive Daytime Sleepiness",
      "abstract": "Several studies over the years have demonstrated that sleep complaints in general, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), in particular, tend to be more prevalent among women. The 2007 Sleep in America poll of women age 40–60 years old found that 20% reported sleepiness that interfered with daily life (Chasens et al., Behav Sleep Med 8(3):157–71, 2010). This chapter discusses EDS due to primary sleep disorders other than Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) including Narcolepsy, Recurrent Hypersomnia, Idiopathic Hypersomnia, Behaviorally Induced Insufficient Sleep Syndrome as well as Hypersomnia Due to Medical condition and Hypersomnia Due to Drug or Substance. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by the tetrad of EDS, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic/hypnapompic hallucinations. Recurrent hypersomnia is characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia often associated with other symptoms that typically last weeks or months apart. Episodes usually last a few days to several weeks and appear one to ten times a year. Sleep and general behavior must be normal between episodes. Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) and Menstrual-related hypersomnia are two distinct clinical subtypes of recurrent hypersomnia. Idiopathic hypersomnia is characterized by constant and severe excessive sleepiness. Naps are typically unrefreshing and post-awakening confusion (sleep drunkenness) is often reported. EDS is a very prevalent problem in developed societies. Women tend to complain more of EDS than men. This prevalence may partially be due to greater sleep deprivation, hormonal factors, and the higher incidence of some primary and secondary sleep disorders in women.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorder with a prevalence rate of 20-30% worldwide. Insomnia is a condition of unsatisfactory quality and/or quantity of sleep, with difficulty falling asleep, remaining asleep, or waking early and being unable to return to sleep. Factors like stressful life events, changes in work shifts, night watching, smoking, alcohol drinking and other mental disorders are the common predisposing factors which are leading to sleeplessness commonly in youngsters and middle-aged people. As use of sedatives may lead to dependency, impaired memory etc., so the Homoeopathy has a good scope in sleep disorders with minimal effects. Passiflora Incarnata is one of the frequently used remedy in Homoeopathy for insomnia. Its use in sleep disorders have been dated back to ancient periods. From ancient times in India, Africa, Europe, Turkey, America, Brazil, Iraq, Poland etc. it was used as traditional medicine for inducing sleep i.e., as a hypnotic. It is indicated for sleeplessness arising from exhaustion, over work, mental worries. As the above mentioned factors are frequent causes for sleeplessness now a day, Passiflora incarnate has been selected as medicinal intervention. This study aims at establishing the effectiveness of Passiflora Incarnata mother tincture in treating insomnia. This research is an experimental research having no control group with a sample size of 20 between the age group of 25-50 years. Those participants in the study sample who were meeting the criteria according to Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) were diagnosed as insomniac. A cut-off score of greater than or equal to 6 on the AIS is used to establish the diagnosis of insomnia. The same scale (AIS) was used to assess the results after taking the medicinal intervention. The results showed that the Passiflora Incarnata mother tincture medicine is effective in treating insomnia. Keywords: Athens Insomnia Scale, Insomnia, Passiflora Incarnata mother tincture.",

      "title": "Subjective sleep problems in young women suffering from premenstrual dysphoric disorder",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common disorder that affects nearly 9–72% women across studies.[1–3] Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is the more severe form of the PMS and its prevalence ranges between 3% and 30%.[2,4] Sleep problems form an integral part of the problem as they are included in the diagnostic criteria for PMDD.[5] A number of studies have tried to find association between PMS or PMDD with sleep pattern and quality of sleep in the past. Sleep was examined using subjective as well as objective measures.[6–10] Majority of the studies have recorded sleep using a polysomnograph across various phases of menstrual cycle.[6–10] However, many of the patients experience first-night effect while sleeping in a sleep laboratory and this may adversely affect polysomnographic data.[11,12] Subjective perception of sleep-related parameters may not match the objective data, and resultantly the patient often complains of subjectively poor-quality sleep despite a good sleep on polysomnograph.[13] The common example is the paradoxical insomnia. Subjective perception of sleep which affects the clinical picture to a greater extent was examined by only a handful of these studies.[6,10] Though as scientists we rely more on objective evidences, still the subjective parameters cannot be overlooked as they are stronger determinants of quality of life. Hence, the present study was planned to assess subjective sleep problems in PMDD subjects and to compare them with the non-PMDD group. We further hypothesized that subjective sleep parameters would also affect the daytime functioning.\r\n\r\nThis questionnaire-based study was done in a nursing college after seeking approval of the institutional ethics committee and permission of college administration. All the female students were invited to participate in the study.\r\n\r\nFemale teachers who took the responsibility to get the questionnaires filled were explained the purpose of the study beforehand. They were also explained what kind of information was intended from each question in a training session. The questionnaire was distributed among the girls with the help of female teachers. Hence, the authors were blinded regarding the identity of participants. This blinding helped to motivate the participants. Teachers then explained the purpose of study to all students and encouraged them to volunteer the information.\r\n\r\nVerbal informed consent was taken from the participants and those who were not interested in participating in the study were excluded. The girls who were taking any kind of psychotropic drug or hormonal therapy were also advised not to participate in this study.\r\n\r\nThe survey questionnaire was designed in Hindi language. It contained instructions regarding intended information. First part of the questionnaire contained instructions and the exclusion criteria as mentioned above. The next part contained questions regarding participants’ demographic data and changes observed in their sleep patterns prior to 1 week of onset of menstruation as compared to other days of the month during past 3 months. These questions included: “change in total sleep time” (responses were increased, as usual, decreased); “time to bed” (advanced, as usual, or delayed); “quality of sleep” (poor, as usual, better); etc. Subjects were supposed to choose the response that best described their condition.\r\n\r\nScreening for the PMDD was based upon DSM-IV-TR criteria.[5] The question was as follows: “Did you notice any change in your mood (depressed, as usual, better) 1 week prior to onset of your menstruation as compared to other days of the month?”. Similar questions were asked regarding other symptoms e.g. irritability (increased, as usual, worse); ability to concentrate (better, as usual, poor) etc.” In this manner, all the 11 criteria mentioned in DSM-IV-TR were changed in the question form. Subjects responded by marking the option that best explained their condition on that item. As per the DSM-IV-TR criteria, subjects who fulfilled 5 of the 11 criteria with at least 1 from the first 4 criteria during past 3 months were considered PMDD. However, DSM requires prospective charting of symptoms for the diagnosis of PMDD; hence, these cases were termed as possible-PMDD.\r\n\r\nStudents were provided explanation if they had any difficulty in understanding the meaning of any of the items. The questionnaires were then collected and analyzed.\r\n\r\nStatistical analysis was done with the help of SPSS version 17.0. Cohort was divided into two groups – those with PMDD and those not fulfilling the criteria of PMDD. Chi-square test was used to compare non-parametric variables.\r\n\r\nThe study sample consisted of 269 subjects. The average age of students was 19.06 years (±1.56 years). 37.5% students met the criteria for possible-PMDD.\r\n\r\nPossible-PMDD subjects reported that their sleep quality was worse before the onset of their menstruation, as compared to subjects who did not fulfill the criteria for PMDD. Table 1 depicts the other details of sleep-related variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1\r\n\r\nComparison of sleep-related variables between possible-PMDD and no PMDD groups\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo difference was reported in dream frequency between these groups. However, emotions associated with dreams were reported to differ between the two groups. Possible-PMDD group reported higher frequency of anxiety and anger in their dreams, as compared to the other group (χ2 = 24.93, df = 3, P < 0.001). However, no difference was observed in the frequency of parasomnia (sleep talking, sleepwalking) and snoring between these groups.\r\n\r\nPossible-PMDD group complained of fatigue during the day (χ2 = 36.68, df = 3, P < 0.001) and daytime sleepiness (χ2 = 18.16, df = 3, P < 0.001).\r\n\r\nOur study found that possible-PMDD group had poor sleep as compared to non-PMDD group on several measures of sleep including bed time, sleep quality, sleep-onset latency, sleep maintenance, and wake time. Similarly, daytime fatigue and daytime sleepiness was also reported by possible-PMDD group. This is in concordance with the results of earlier studies. Mauri et al.[10] have reported that women with severe PMS complain of increased sleepiness and fatigue before menstruation as compared to other periods of their own menstrual cycle as well as with reference to the control group. An increase in daytime sleepiness was the only factor that was able to differentiate between women with and without PMS in another study.[14] Severe PMS has been known to worsen the sleep quality, increase the daytime sleepiness, and is associated with reduced alertness during the day.[9] Thus, these studies reported that the fatigue, sleepiness, and alertness during the day may be used to differentiate PMDD group from non-PMDD group. However, unlike the present study, these studies failed to find any difference in nocturnal sleep. This association between PMS and disturbed subjective sleep parameters (increased nocturnal awakenings, unpleasant dreams, delayed wake time, and morning tiredness) was reported by only one study which was conducted long back.[10] As the quest for the objectivity has increased, most of the work in this area during past decade was done using objective parameters, which may not find any difference despite subjective symptoms.[15] Thus, as a clinician, it is important to consider patients’ symptoms rather than just look for the laboratory reports. Further, as a scientist, these results promote us to search for the factors that are responsible for the difference between subjective and objective quality of sleep in this specialized group.\r\n\r\nWe also found an increased frequency of daytime symptoms in possible–PMDD group, which could have been an influence of nocturnal sleep. Considering the example of paradoxical insomnia, in future, it will be interesting to examine the relationship between PMDD, subjective sleep quality, objective sleep parameters, and daytime symptoms. This may guide us in the management of PMDD.\r\n\r\nWe would like to mention that in this study, subjects without possible PMDD also reported sleep problems. This suggests that sleep problems are not governed by PMDD; rather, they are related to menstrual cycle. In the past, one study reported that poor sleep quality was seen not only in PMDD group but also among non-PMDD women; however; other factors remained unaffected.[6] Manber et al.[14] also reported that sleep disturbance, e.g. increased sleep latency, reduced sleep efficiency, and poor sleep quality, was not limited to PMS group; rather, it was found in all women before menstruation. One reason for these results could be fluctuation in plasma melatonin level and sleep–wake rhythms across menstrual cycle, even in healthy females.[7] These evidences suggest that poor sleep could be a trait marker of premenstrual period rather than a state marker of PMS or PMDD. In other words, sleep changes may be an inherent property of menstrual cycle and PMDD sufferers could have an exaggeration of sleep-related problems during late luteal phase. Like any other study, this study also had some methodological limitations. First, it was a survey and questionnaire can be used to screen only. Secondly, surveys are always associated with recall bias. Thirdly, DSM-IV-TR suggests that PMDD should be diagnosed prospectively, which was not done in the present study. Nonetheless, this study shows important findings in this area and is probably the first Indian study to address this important but yet unrecognized issue. In addition, this study adds up to the scarcely available literature that has examined subjective sleep parameters in PMDD subjects.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, possible-PMDD sufferers have problems with their night sleep and also bear daytime symptoms. These symptoms negatively affect their ability to accomplish daily chores.",

Behavior subtypes of childhood insomnias affect 10% to 30% of children and result from inconsistent parental limit-setting and improper sleep-onset association. Behavior insomnias are treated using extinction techniques and parent education. Hypnotic medications are not recommended. Obstructive sleep apnea affects 1% to 5% of children. Polysomnography is required to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea; history and physical examination alone are not adequate. Adenotonsillectomy is the first-line treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure is the second-line treatment for children who do not respond to surgery or if adenotonsillectomy is contraindicated. Restless legs syndrome can be difficult to recognize and has an association with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Management of restless legs syndrome includes treatment of iron deficiency, if identified, and removal of triggering factors. Parasomnias affect up to 50% of children and usually resolve spontaneously by adolescence. Management of parasomnias involves parental education, reassurance, safety precautions, and treating comorbid conditions. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is found during adolescence, manifesting as a night owl preference. Treatment of delayed sleep phase syndrome includes sleep hygiene, nighttime melatonin, and morning bright light exposure.

      "title": "Exploring the connection between sleep disorders and neurological diseases: implications for diagnosis and management",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital and complex physiological process which is critical to maintain normal functioning of the nervous system1. Research suggests that lack of sleep or sleep disorders increase the risk of several health issues including hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, depression, and obesity1. In this article, we aim to discover the relationship between sleep disorders and neurological diseases and its implications for diagnosis and management. Sleep disorders have been shown to have an impact on several neurological diseases. Poor sleep can increase the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), multiple sclerosis, and Huntington disease2. Moreover, sleep disorders have also been shown to have an impact on increasing the risk of stroke, epilepsy, and affecting cognitive function such as learning and memory. Furthermore, autism spectrum disorder and neuropathic pain have also shown to have an association with sleep disorders2. Just like sleep disorders have a negative impact on the nervous system, some neurological diseases can affect the sleeping patterns of an individual. A few central nervous system conditions have been shown to cause sleep apnea which results in a disturbed circadian rhythm resulting in difficulty sleeping at night. Over 50% of patients with a history of stroke have reported of sleeping problems. Moreover, AD and PD have also been shown to have an association with poor sleep3. Establishing a robust diagnosis of sleep disorders in patients with neurological diseases can prove to be challenging due to overlap in symptoms which may lead to misdiagnosis. The current gold standard test for diagnosing sleeping disorders is polysomnography4. Other tests include: lab testing to screen for stimulants or other medications which may increase the level of alertness and disturb sleep; Multiple Sleep Latency Test to determine the degree of sleepiness; Maintenance of Wakefulness Test to test for the ability of staying awake; and actigraphy which includes the use of a device worn on the writs which provides data regarding periods of rest and/or sleep activities5. Even though these tests are accurate per se, there are always certain limitations. In order to understand the complex relationship between neurological diseases and sleep disorders, there is a need for emerging diagnostic technologies to improve accuracy which is critical for providing an early intervention and improving patient outcomes. Treating sleep disorders among patients with underlying neurological disorders can also be arduous, given the complex nature of the relationship between the two. Therapies targeted toward treating sleep disorders include light therapy, orofacial therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). In addition, medical management includes the use of medications such as benzodiazepines (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone), melatonin receptor agonists (eg, ramelteon), and orexin receptor antagonists (eg, suvorexant)6. Furthermore, continuous positive airway pressure has shown promising results in improving sleep among patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea7. Although the discussed managements and treatments are excellent for treating sleep disorders, there still remains a lack of literature in the management and treatment for sleeping disorders among those with underlying neurological disorders. Thus, there is a need for more targeted therapies which take account of the underlying mechanisms of sleep disorders and neurological diseases. Collaboration between neurologists and sleep specialists is crucial to enhance the identification and early intervention of sleep disorder and neurological diseases. It is also imperative for primary care physicians to have a strong understanding of sleep abnormalities in patients with neurological conditions. These physicians can screen patients for sleep disorders and refer them so specialists for further evaluation and treatment, which will provide appropriate care to the patients and improve outcomes. Moreover, educating the patients regarding importance of sleep and their beneficial effects on neurological health is essential. The combined effort of patients and their health care professionals will provide a more comprehensive care for those suffering with neurological diseases and sleep disorders. To conclude, sleep is crucial for optimal functioning of the nervous system and research has shown that sleep disorders increase the likelihood of several health issues. The relationship between sleep disorders and neurological disorders in complex making appropriate diagnosis and treatment challenging. Poor sleep has been linked to various neurological diseases including AD, PD, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington disease. Establishing an accurate diagnosis of sleep disorders in patients with neurological disease is necessary for early intervention and improved outcomes. Moreover, targeted therapies that consider the underlying disease mechanisms of sleep disorders and neurological are needed to improve management and treatment of these patients. Collaboration between neurologists, sleep specialists, and primary care physicians is necessary for better identifications and treatment of sleep disorders in patients with underlying neurological conditions. Lastly, educating the patients regarding the importance of sleep and encouraging a combined effort between patients and health care providers will provide a more comprehensive care for those with neurological diseases and sleep disorders.

Such difficulties can include problems with the placement and manipulation of food in the oral cavity or the physiology of swallowing, or both, and are referred to as dysphagia. Swallowing is a highly complex motor process, requiring neurological control and coordination of breathing and swallowing. Cerebral damage may affect the neurological control of swallowing (Murdoch and Theodoros 2001) and consequently, the child is at increased risk of fluids and food material entering the airway, termed aspiration. According to Reilly et al. (2000) the signs suggestive of aspiration include coughing, choking or deterioration in respiratory status during a feed, noisy or wet breathing, or excessive pharyngeal secretions; sneezing during drinking may also indicate nasopharyngeal incoordination and reflux.",

Circadian rhythm hypotheses (summarized in) have stimulated research into the pathophysiology of SAD, postulating that: 1.The illness is a consequence of delayed phase position, 2.It is correlated with diminished circadian amplitude, or 3.It results from changes in the nocturnal duration between dusk and dawn e.g. of low core body temperature or melatonin secretion. Light is considered to act directly on the circadian pacemaker ('Process C') and not on sleep dependent processes ('Process S'). Thus successful treatment of SAD must act via mechanisms within known retinohypothalamic pathways. Conversely, emergence of SAD symptoms may reflect inappropriate neurobiological response to decreasing daylength.",

In addition to changes in sleep duration and quality, sleep architecture also changes as age progresses. Age by itself does not result in sleep disorders; rather, these changes are associated with psychosocial and health factors in the elderly such as the existence of multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, and age-related changes in circadian rhythm. Older adults have increased prevalence of various primary sleep disorders, including restless leg syndrome, insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, circadian rhythm disturbances and periodic limb syndrome. Challenges in identifying, diagnosing, and treating sleep disorders in older adults with dementia also exist, which further complicates the management of sleep disorders in these patients. Poor sleep not only impacts the quality of life and cognitive functioning but is also associated with increased morbidity and mortality and thus requires careful screening and assessment in the elderly population.&lt;br&gt;",

      "abstract": "Sexuality in dementia is infrequently addressed. Dementia is characterized by a progressive deterioration in all domains of functioning, including loss of sexual function. However, the diagnosis of dementia does not mean an immediate or complete cessation of sexuality in the person, or a loss of the ability to consent to sexual activity with a partner. A discussion of sexuality in dementia occurs infrequently in clinical care for several reasons. These include (a) a discomfort in discussing sexuality in older adults, (b) the fear of causing social or cultural offense, and (c) the assumption that the cessation of the reproductive period implies the end of sexual life in older adults. There is also a tendency to focus on the preservation of cognition and independence, with relative neglect of the need for physical and emotional intimacy or quality of life. Patients with dementia are more likely to be sexually active than not. The most common change is a lack or loss or sexual desire. Inappropriate sexual behaviors occur in a minority of patients (28%) and can be usually managed with behavioral measures, with the use of pharmacotherapy for symptomatic management in refractory cases. Other clinical and ethical concerns in dementia include the capacity to consent to sexual intimacy, the formation of new relationships, sexuality in long-term residential facilities, and vulnerability to sexual abuse. Dementia care guidelines recommend a low threshold of suspicion for abuse, with a focus on patient safety. These must, however, be counterweighed by respect for patient autonomy and wishes.",

Estimates of RISP prevalence vary dramatically, yielding estimates between 6% and 40%. Sleep paralysis is often considered as a sleep-onset problem under the assumption that episodes occur at the beginning of the sleep period during Sleep Onset REM Period (SOREMP). Multiphase sleep-wake schedule (MPS) regimes likely produce high level of cognitive arousal precipitating episodes by increasing potential for waking during immediate post-interruption REMPs.

      "title": "Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders and anesthesia considerations",
      "abstract": "Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that result from progressive damage to cells and nervous system connections that are essential for mobility, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognition. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Neurological disorders are disorders that involve the brain, spinal cord or nerve and muscle. Children with neurological disorders may have disorders such as epilepsy, developmental delay, cerebral palsy, meningitis, genetic/metabolic diseases or diseases of muscle or nerve such as muscular dystrophy or peripheral neuropathy. These illnesses are frequently severe and potentially have long lasting consequences for the affected children. The pathologies most frequently responsible for psycho-physical disorders can be summarized into three groups: collaboration difficulties (autism spectrum disorders, intellectual impairment, phobia); motor dysfunction (cerebral palsy, epilepsy, other brain pathologies, neuromuscular disorders), and craniofacial anomalies (Down syndrome, other genetic syndromes). Due to their clinical history, and the lack of collaboration, in pediatric non-cooperative patients with Special Needs (SN), the anesthesiological risk may result difficult to assess, despite the fact that they meet the criteria of the outpatient management applied for the patient without disabilities. The perioperative management of pediatric patients with psycho-physical disorders with related relational and cognitive problems must be carefully planned, in order to make the entire hospitalization process as comfortable and as less traumatic as possible. General anesthesia is the most suitable type of anesthesia in pediatric patients with Special Needs (SN), although anesthetic complications are more frequent in these patients, mainly due to comorbidities, taken drugs and anatomical peculiarities. Some studies observed no correlation between multiple anesthesia exposures and neurodevelopmental deficits, while others reported that even a single exposure could increase the risk of deficits. An increased risk of developmental or behavioral disorders as the consequence of surgeries requiring general anesthesia was observed. Based on current studies, it is necessary to endeavor to limit the duration and numbers of anesthesia and the dose of anesthetic agents. The evaluation must include history and physical examination pertaining to the conditions requiring special anaesthetic considerations. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing these neurological disorders in pediatric patients to improve overall quality of life and long-term outcomes.",

Death within 12 hours of arrest is commonly associated with massive drug overdose, such as can occur with smugglers who conceal drugs within body cavities, an act that is known as \"body packing.\" Deaths that occur days to weeks or longer after incarceration can be associated with drug withdrawal or other natural causes related to drug use (2).",

      "abstract": "Transient epileptic amnesia is an adult onset form of temporal epilepsy which is characterised by recurrent acute seizure-induced amnesia often accompanied by ongoing memory disturbances of autobiographical, topographical amnesia and accelerated long-term forgetting. The first case report of transient epileptic amnesia was described more than a hundred years ago. However, more extensively investigations of this type of epilepsy were started not long ago. In 1998 diagnostic criteria were formulated: 1) history of recurrent witnessed episodes of transient amnesia; 2) cognitive functions other than memory are judged to be intact during typical episodes by a reliable witness; 3) evidence for a diagnosis of epilepsy, provided by one or more of the following: (a) wake or sleep electroencephalography; (b) the co-occurrence of other seizure types (if their roughly concurrent onset and/or close association with episodes of transient amnesia suggested a connection); (c) a clear-cut response to anticonvulsant therapy. From case reports that are analysed in literature it is not difficult to summarise clinical characteristics: transient epileptic amnesia usually starts later in life, more often in men than in women; amnestic episodes are brief, recurrent and often occur upon waking; memory loss is usually mixed type with anterograde and retrograde amnesia; in 65% of patients amnesia is associated with gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, déjà vu, a brief period of unresponsiveness, automatisms; epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography were seen in 43% cases; although transient epileptic amnesia has an excellent response rate to anticonvulsant therapy, between episodes patients still suffer from accelerated long-term forgetting, remote memory impairment and topographical amnesia. Differential diagnostic of transient epileptic amnesia is diverse and diagnosis is usually inaccurate and overdue. Treatment with monotherapy often helps totally prevent recurrence of attacks. In the paper we review two case reports of patients with transient epileptic amnesia.",

Depression may coexist with long-term sleep difficulties in some people, and vice versa for those who already have depression, they are more likely to develop sleep disturbance. In other words, the development of one symptom can trigger the development of another. Patients must therefore pay close attention to their sleep difficulties. Numerous psychiatric illnesses that are related to sleep difficulties might worsen a patient's overall condition. If the issue of sleep difficulties is not resolved in a timely manner, it may eventually lead to the appearance of other connected psychiatric illnesses, which may make the patient's condition worse overall. Depression is a prevalent mental illness. Clinical symptoms of depression commonly include tiredness, delayed thinking, and diminished volitional activity. Sleep disturbances can arise for a variety of reasons, including physical illnesses and psychological issues. This review can provide some suggestions for the development of prevention and intervention programs for individuals with depression and sleep disturbance.",

There are some disorders, however, such as periodic limb movements in sleep, restless legs syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal dystonia, bruxism, and somnambulism, which occur primarily during sleep. The diagnosis and management of these disorders pose a challenge to neuropsychiatric practice, not only because they may be difficult to distinguish from other neuropsychiatric disorders, but also because psychiatric disorders are often co-morbid with them. Study of these disorders is necessary for an understanding of the interaction of sleep and movement, and how disturbance in one may affect the other.",

It is particularly important for the primary care physician to screen for sleep problems in children, especially in high-risk populations. A detailed history evaluating circumstances related to the sleep problem should be obtained. Addition of pharmacological therapy to non-pharmacological interventions for pediatric sleep disorders for disorders such as insomnia, parasomnias, narcolepsy, RLS or PLMs should be diagnostically driven, and should consider both the best match between the medication type and individual patient, as well as the dosing regimen with the least side effects. Until these medications are systematically studied or newer specific agents are developed for pediatric sleep problems, it is necessary for practitioners looking after children to optimize quality of life and sequalae related to sleep problems, while minimizing potential side effects.",

O objetivo deste estudo foi revisar a literatura quanto às consequências individuais, econômicas e sociais causadas pela SAOS. Identificaram-se diversas complicações da SAOS relacionadas ao indivíduo: (1) alterações físicas e comportamentais: sono excessivo, fadiga, ansiedade, irritabilidade, depressão, redução da libido, diminuição da qualidade de vida, astenia, consequências metabólicas (ganho de peso, diabetes e dislipidemia) e cardiovasculares (hipertensão arterial sistêmica, aterosclerose e doença coronariana); (2) disfunção neurocognitiva: déficits de atenção, percepção, memória, raciocínio, juízo, pensamento e linguagem. Quanto à relação da SAOS e repercussões socioeconômicas, tem-se: (1) aumento do número, proporção e gravidade de acidentes automobilísticos devido à diminuição da concentração do motorista; (2) prejuízos ocupacionais com queda na produtividade, demissões e acidentes de trabalho; (3) prejuízo social: o individuo com SAOS representa também um perigo potencial para toda a sociedade por aumento de imperícias; (4) aumento de gastos públicos e privados: manutenção de rodovias e estrutura de fiscalização e apoio, gastos previdenciários, custos diagnósticos, terapêuticos e hospitalares. A SAOS deveria ser considerada uma doença de saúde pública, dados seus inequívocos prejuízos individuais, sociais e econômicos.

      "title": "Concussion in Sport",
      "abstract": "Concussions affect millions of athletes of all ages each year in a variety of sports. Athletes in certain sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and combative sports like boxing are at higher risk for concussion. Direct or indirect mechanical forces acting on the skull and brain cause a concussion, which is a milder form of brain injury. Conventional neuroimaging (e.g., computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for concussion is typically negative. Concussions involve both neurometabolic and subtle structural damage to the brain that results in signs (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, confusion), symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, nausea), and functional impairment (e.g., cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor). Symptoms, impairment, and recovery time following concussion can last from a few days to weeks or months, based on a variety of risk factors, including younger age, female sex, history of concussion, and history of migraine. Following a concussion, athletes may experience one or more clinical profiles, including cognitive fatigue, vestibular, oculomotor, post-traumatic migraine (PTM), mood/anxiety, and/or cervical. The heterogeneous nature of concussion warrants a comprehensive approach to assessment, including a thorough clinical examination and interview; symptom inventories; and cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor, and exertion-based evaluations. Targeted treatment and rehabilitation strategies including behavior management, vestibular, vision, and exertion therapies, and in some cases medication can be effective in treating the various concussion clinical profiles. Some athletes experience persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and/or psychological issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) following concussion. Following appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies, determination of safe return to play is predicated on being symptom-free and back to normal levels of function at rest and following exertion. Certain populations, including youth athletes, may be at a higher risk for worse impairment and prolonged recovery following concussion. It has been suggested that some athletes experience long-term effects associated with concussion including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, additional empirical studies on the role of concussion on CTE are needed, as CTE may have multiple causes that are unrelated to sport participation and concussion.",

Complaints of insomnia are categorized into difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, unwanted early morning awakenings, and non-restorative sleep often with daytime consequences such as excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue. Factors that interfere with the opportunity to obtain sufficient sleep include other sleep disorders, substance use, shift work, or the presence of another psychiatric disorder. As one moves from middle age to the later years of life, the aging process creates changes in sleep architecture and continuity that increase the vulnerability to developing chronic insomnia. Research indicates that some crucial interventions that buffer against chronic insomnia may help the older adult to adopt a regular daily schedule, a healthier lifestyle and sleep behaviors, and increase the quality of social interactions and physical activity.",

Ein Drittel aller chronischen Insomnien wird als primäre Insomnie oder insomnische Störung bezeichnet, wenn keiner der oben genannten Faktoren ursächlich identifiziert werden kann. Üblicherweise werden chronische Insomnien in der ärztlichen Praxis medikamentös mit Hypnotika oder anderen sedierenden Substanzen, wie etwa sedierenden Antidepressiva behandelt. In den letzten 20 Jahren hat sich gezeigt, dass kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutische Ansätze (KVT) bei chronischen Insomnien auch unabhängig von der Ursache erfolgreich eingesetzt werden können. Zu den Methoden der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie gehört die Aufklärung über Schlaf und Schlafhygiene (Psychoedukation), Entspannungstechniken wie etwa die progressive Muskelentspannung, spezifische verhaltenstherapeutische Techniken wie etwa die Stimuluskontrolle oder die Schlafrestriktion sowie kognitive Techniken zur Reduktion nächtlicher Grübeleien. Aufgrund von mehreren, in den letzten Jahren veröffentlichten Meta-Analysen können diese Techniken insbesondere in ihrer Applikation als Kombinationstherapie, als evidenz-basiert und der pharmakologischen Therapie als kurzzeitig gleichwertig und langfristig überlegen angesehen werden.

As such, the appropriate assessment and treatment of sleep disorders, particularly in older populations, are vital. Carefully considered sleep diaries and histories are essential diagnostic tools; comorbid problems such as pain or depression and current medications should be considered as possible causes. Non-pharmacological interventions such as sleep hygiene and cognitive behavioural treatments should be considered first.

Determining the cause of daytime sleepiness is the first step in treating it. Setting appropriate and realistic treatment goals with the patient and initiating treatment are the next steps. Although the medications available to improve daytime wakefulness (e.g., amphetamines, methylphenidate, pemoline, and modafinil) are effective, they are not a substitute for sleep.

Indeed, you can get dream reports without REM when REM is chemically suppressed via antidepressant medications. Just as dreams can occur without REM, REM sleep can occur without dream reports. About 20 percent of awakenings after a REM episode results in no dream report. Activation of REM, therefore, does not necessarily eventuate in a dream or at least a dream report. In addition, children who have abundant REM do not consistently report dreams until visuo-spatial and cognitive skills have matured enough to support reporting of visual narratives (Foulkes, 1982). Similarly, patients with lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex, basal forebrain, and near the occipitotemporoparietal junction sometimes report complete cessation of dreaming (Solms, 1997). In addition, Solms emphasized that disconnection of the ascending meso-limbic-cortical dopaminergic tracts from their termination sites in ventromedial frontal lobes could also lead to the loss of dreaming. Given that this tract is associated with instinctual appetitive drive and motivational states, it seems reasonable to conclude that this dopaminergic system may participate in the generation of some dreams. The loss of dreaming in these patients is not due simply to an inability to recall dreams, as their basic memory and recall abilities are largely intact. REM physiology as measured by sleep EEG is normal in these individuals, thus REM is still operating.",

      "title": "Epilepsy in children and anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy, also called seizure disorder, is the most common childhood brain disorder in the United States. The aetiology of epilepsy in children is multifactorial with congenital, metabolic, infective, and problems associated with prematurity being common causes. Nearly 3 million Americans have epilepsy. About 450,000 of them are under 17 years old. About 1 in 200 children (0.5%) have epilepsy, a neurological condition where children have a predisposition to recurrent, unprovoked seizures. There are many different types of epilepsy, especially in infancy, childhood and adolescence. Epilepsy can be thought of in terms of either: the site of seizure origin in the brain (generalised or focal seizures), or the underlying cause. Genetic epilepsies (formerly called idiopathic or primary epilepsies) occur in an otherwise normal person and are due to a genetic predisposition to seizures. Some epilepsies are due to an underlying abnormality of the brain structure or chemistry (formerly called symptomatic or secondary epilepsies). Other epilepsies have no known cause. Epilepsy is commonly diagnosed in children and can be confused with other conditions. An accurate diagnosis is essential. A seizure is an excessive surge of electrical activity in the brain that can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on which parts of the brain are involved. Seizures can be provoked or unprovoked. Provoked seizures, caused by fever in a young child or severe hypoglycemia, are not considered to be forms of epilepsy. Unprovoked seizures have no clear cause but can be related to genetics or brain injury. When a child has two or more unprovoked seizures, epilepsy is often the diagnosis. Despite advances in antiepileptic medication therapy, a significant number of pediatric patients with epilepsy have seizures that are not well controlled. Antiepileptic medications interact with anesthetic agents, and common anesthetics can precipitate or suppress seizure activity. There are important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between AEDs and drugs commonly used in anaesthesia. These affect both drug efficacy and the risk of seizure activity intraoperatively.",

Sleep disturbances, particularly insomnia and hypersomnia (but also delayed sleep phase and sleep need), often co-occur with the mood disorders. Evidence has accrued suggesting that sleep disturbances are important pathways contributing to the mood disorders. The risk of depression is increased by preexisting insomnia, sleep problems interfere with depression treatment success, and in depressed adults treating the depression and insomnia is markedly better relative to treating depression alone. An evidence base is growing for the use of psychosocial treatments for sleep disturbance in youth. We describe the protocol we have developed for treating insomnia in depressed youth. Potential advantages for delivering psychosocial treatments for sleep disturbance, over medication treatments, are reviewed. We also discuss the importance of working with parents, the slight tip toward eveningness with the onset and progression through puberty, and the role of technology (cell phones, video games, etc.) in contributing to sleep disturbance.",

      "title": "The Strategy of Clinical Procedure for Determining Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

      "abstract": "Biological, environmental, behavioral, and social factors can influence sleep and lead to sleep disorders or diseases. Sleep disorders are common, numerous and heterogeneous in terms of their etiology, pathogenesis, and symptomatology. Management of sleep-wake circadian disorders (SWCD) includes education to sleep hygiene, behavioral strategies, psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly), instrument-based treatments (i.e. positive airway pressure therapy, hypoglossal nerve stimulation), and pharmacotherapy. Depending on the disease, therapy varies and is executed sequentially, or can be a combination of several forms of therapy. Drugs used for SWCD include traditional sleep or wake-promoting agents, chronotherapeutic agents. Recently, novel medications, which are more precisely acting on specific neurochemical systems (i.e. orexin system) important for sleep and wake, are also increasingly being used. In this review, the pharmacotherapy of common sleep disorders (insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorder, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep wake disorders, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders) embedded in the overall therapeutic concept of each disorder is presented. There is also an outlook on possible future pharmacotherapies.",

Polysomnogram revealed severe OSA; initiation of CPAP and levothyroxine resulted in immediate improvement. The lack of a previous psychiatric history and acuteness of presentation was consistent with hypothyroid psychosis complicated by sleep deprivation cause by untreated OSA. Primary hypothyroidism is a common disorder often associated with depression. It is rarely associated with psychosis and was first described as \"myxoedematous madness\" in 1949. It has not been previously reported to cause psychosis when associated with obstructive sleep apnea. This case illustrates the need for examination of potential multiple organic causes in a patient who presents with psychosis in the critical care setting.",

      "abstract": "The word “apnea” means literally \"without breath\", and thus “sleep apnea” means not breathing while sleeping. Normally, during sleep we do not have pauses in-between breaths. Individuals with sleep apnea often stop breathing completely (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) during sleep for 10 seconds or more and sometimes for more than one minute, which leads to low oxygen in the brain and other organs. Sleep apnea is, therefore, a chronic condition where the normal sleep respiratory cycle is disrupted. Approximately 25% of adults seem to have sleep apnea of some degree. Men seem to be more commonly affected than women (especially pre-menopausal women). Other risk factors include: older age, overweight or obesity, and having a small mouth, jaw or throat, large tongue or retro-position of the lower jaw. Smoking, alcohol, ingestion of sedative medications, chronic nasal inflammation (rhinitis) with obstruction, large neck girth, etc represent risk factors for this disorder. Sleep apnea can be treated by applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), dental appliances or surgery. The decision to treat and with what specific modality is dependent on a complex interplay of symptoms, co-existent disorders and disease severity. This decision should be made by the patient in conjunction with the healthcare provider, preferably a specialist in Sleep Medicine who has enough experience in diagnosing and treating this condition.",

      "abstract": "<ns4:p>There is a growing interest in personalized and preventive medicine initiatives that leverage serious patient engagement, such as those initiated and pursued among participants in the quantified-self movement. However, many of the self-assessments that result are not rooted in good scientific practices, such as exploiting controls, dose escalation strategies, multiple endpoint monitoring, etc. Areas where individual monitoring and health assessments have great potential involve sleep and behavior, as there are a number of very problematic sleep and behavior-related conditions that are hard to treat without personalization. For example, winter depression or seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a serious, recurrent, atypical depressive disorder impacting millions each year. In order to prevent yearly recurrence antidepressant drugs are used to prophylactically treat SAD. In turn, these antidepressant drugs can affect sleep patterns, further exacerbating the condition. Because of this, possibly unique combinatorial or ‘polypharmaceutical’ interventions involving sleep aids may be prescribed. However, little research into the effects of such polypharmacy on the long-term sleep quality of treated individuals has been pursued. Employing wireless monitoring in a patient-centered study we sought to gain insight into the influence of polypharmacy on sleep patterns and the optimal course of therapy for an individual being treated for SAD with duloxetine (Cymbalta) and temazepam. We analyzed continuous-time sleep data while dosages and combinations of these agents were varied. We found that the administration of Cymbalta led to an exacerbation of the subject’s symptoms in a statistically significant way. Further, we unmasked and monitored treatment effects on a latent obstructive sleep apnea condition. We argue that such analyses may be necessary to effectively treat individuals with similar overall clinical manifestations and diagnosis, despite their having a unique set of symptoms, genetic profiles and exposure histories. We also consider the limitations of our study and areas for further research.</ns4:p>",

This begins with a complete history and physical examination, followed by laboratory testing such as polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and actigraphy. The treatment of sleep disorders caused by co-morbid conditions is discussed under seven categories, including the use of general measures (e.g., sleep hygiene, encouraging patients to develop good sleep habits, medication), treatment of the co-morbid condition, treatment of insomnia, treatment of excessive daytime somnolence, treatment of parasomnias, treatment of sleep-wake schedule disorders, and treatment of secondary or symptomatic restless legs syndrome.",

The negative effect of sleep deprivation is usually associated with that of circadian factors as well as that of pathological (sleep disorders) and/or pharmacological or toxic factors. In the case of uncomplicated sleep deprivation, two countermeasures have been shown to be effective: caffeine and/or a short nap. Their use must be tailored to the need of each individual driver.

In the pre-verbal and early verbal stage, the severity of the clinical picture is primarily determined by concomitant motor pathology (motor dysfunction, dysarthria, general and oral dyspraxia) and by receptive pathology (hearing and auditory perception). In the verbal period, linguistic problems start to play a role, and often combine with oral motor symptoms to present a mixed picture. Various language syndromes do not become clear until some time later. After the kindergarten period, the oral motor and perceptual problems decrease and the language disorders continue to play a role and influence the child's conversation, internal speech reading and spelling at school. In a relatively small number of children without oral motor, perceptual or memory problems, there can be a basic syndrome of \"pure dysphasia\" without any other neurological signs. In somewhat more than half the patients, the basic syndrome of pure dysphasia is accompanied by other neurological signs. Treatment should not be confined to speech therapy techniques, but can only be optimally given by a highly trained team whose expertise also extends to the schooling aspect.",

      "abstract": "Background Sleep difficulties are often reported in practice, and are part of the diagnostic criteria for depression and bipolar disorder. Aims To inform the understanding of the relationship between sleep and both depression and bipolar disorder. Method We conducted a narrative literature review of affective disorders and sleep difficulties in children and young people. Results Specific sleep disorders, such as parasomnias, narcolepsy and sleep-related movement disorders, are associated with depression, whereas insomnia, obstructive sleep apnoea and circadian rhythm disorders are associated with both depression and bipolar disorder in children and young people. Conversely, children and young people with depression can present with a number of sleep difficulties, and these are associated with higher depression severity and greater fatigue, suicidal ideation, physical complaints, pain and decreased concentration. Sleep disturbances among adolescents with bipolar disorder can affect the severity of depressive and manic symptoms, are a poor prognostic indicator and have been associated with social and academic impairment. Antidepressants and antipsychotics can directly affect sleep architecture, which clinicians need to be aware of. Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep problems could prevent and/or minimise the risk of relapse in affective disorders. Conclusions Sleep difficulties can occur before, during and after an episode of depression or bipolar disorder, and have a higher prevalence in affective disorders compared with the general population. A multi-modal approach would include the treatment of both the affective and specific sleep disorder. Further research is needed in this field to understand the impact of combined interventions on clinical outcomes.",

Causes include medical diseases, psychiatric disorders, drugs, behavioural factors, circadian dysrhythmias and primary sleep disorders. Insomnia is common, affecting approximately one-third of the total population, and of these about 10% consider it a chronic problem. Insomnia is more common in females and increases with age. Many people with insomnia resort to ineffective or dangerous self-treatment regimens and the combination of alcohol with non-prescription drugs is common. We have carried out a study on 20 patients with Primary Insomnia and were able to demonstrate significant differences in both descriptive and objective EEG data between those with Primary Insomnia and controls. Careful evaluation of the sleep problem and accurate diagnosis are essential in order to choose the right treatment for an individual patient. When a specific problem is identified (psychiatric, physical, behavioural), then the underlying cause needs to be treated. Insomnia can be treated by either non-pharmacological or pharmacological intervention, and often both are used simultaneously. It is recommended that hypnotic treatments should be used for no more than one month.",

      "abstract": "In this comment, we explored the link between sleep fragmentation and the cardiovascular risk, considering various sleep disorders and methodologies for assessing sleep fragmentation.It is generally known that sleep deprivation increases the cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic risk.Additionally, some data indicates that prolonged sleep is also associated with such risk. 1 In addition to sleep duration, sleep quality is also essential in the assessment of the CV risk.The continuity of sleep is one of its crucial features that contributes to effective rest and refreshment.Sleep may be interrupted by arousals and awakenings, which can result in prolonged wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO).Therefore, it is important to deter mine the threshold for the number of arousals and awakenings during sleep to consider them a normal phenomenon.According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) definition, an arousal is an abrupt shift in electro encephalography (EEG) frequencies, including alpha, theta and/or frequencies greater than 16 Hz (but not spindles), that lasts at least 3 s, with at least 10 s of stable sleep preceding the change. 2The scoring of arousals during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep requires a concurrent increase in the submental electro myography (EMG) lasting at least 1 s. 2 Arousals, which can be accompanied by respiratory events, periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) or sleep brux ism events, are usually followed by autonomic activation, resulting in increased heart rate and blood pressure.Nevertheless, they can also occur spontaneously or be elicited by pain, light, noise, or a change in temperature.The arousal index (ArI), counted as the number of arousals per sleep hour, is frequently considered to quantify sleep fragmentation. 3 Sleep fragmentation, character ized by repetitive interruptions of sleep, is one of the factors contributing to excessive daytime sleepiness.The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is generally considered an imperfect in dicator of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity.It is strongly believed that oxygen saturation parameters (i.e., the mean oxygen saturation, the oxygen desaturation index (ODI), the nadir oxygen saturation, and the percentage of sleep with oxygen saturation <90%) are more effective predictors of CV complications than the index of respiratory events. 4It is worth noting that",

Even in the chronic patient a retrospective diagnosis should be attempted, in order to establish how the patient reached the current situation. Simple questions are likely to establish if the chronic dizzy symptoms started as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease or as a brainstem stroke. Then it is important to establish if the original symptoms are still present, in which case they need to be treated (e.g. repositioning maenouvres for BPPV, migraine prophylaxis) or if you are only dealing with chronic dizzy symptoms. In addition the doctor or physiotherapist needs to establish if the process of central vestibular compensation has been impeded due to additional clinical problems, e.g. visual problems (squints, cataract operation), proprioceptive deficit (neuropathy due to diabetes or alcohol), additional neurological or orthopaedic problems, lack of mobility or confidence, such as fear of falling or psychological disorders. A general neurological examination should also be conducted, amongst other reasons to make sure your patient's `chronic dizziness' is not due to a neurological gait disorder. Treatment of the syndrome of chronic dizziness is multidisciplinary but rehabilitation and simple counselling should be available to all patients. In contrast, vestibular suppressants or tranquilisers should be reduced or, if possible, stopped.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Although the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) dominate the clinical picture, the nonmotor complaints are often more disabling for the Parkinson patient. REVIEW SUMMARY Behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive changes occur commonly and are frequent causes for concern. Depression affects up to half of Parkinson patients and can worsen their motor function. Drug-induced psychoses can range from benign visual hallucinations to paranoid delusions. Dementia, classically described as subcortical, usually occurs in the elderly PD patient and is often clinically distinct from the cortical dementia of Alzheimer's disease although pathological descriptions overlap. A parkinsonian personality has been noted by psychoanalysts and movement disorder experts characterized as rigid and compulsive yet cautious and apprehensive with a subordinate behavior. Sleep disturbances associated with PD include insomnia, sleep fragmentation, daytime somnolence, vivid dreams, rapid eye movement behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome. Sensory symptoms, including pain, may occur, as do symptoms of autonomic dysfunction including postural syncope. Problems with bladder and bowel control and sexual dysfunction are common and often distressing to both the patients and their partners. Fatigue, akathisia, seborrheic dermatitis, and scoliosis are conditions intrinsic to or aggravated by PD. Most of these problems are amenable to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. CONCLUSION Helping patients with PD cope with these difficulties is just as important as manipulating therapy to provide control of their motor symptoms. (THE NEUROLOGIST 6:18-27, 2000)",

      "abstract": "To review current knowledge on blood pressure variability.Blood pressure variability has a time-course ranging from a few seconds or minutes (short-term variability) to 24 h (long-term variability) or 1 year (seasonal variations). The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

Culturally established signs and symptoms of such illness are varied and complex, and its medicament is believed to be completely within the culture-specific treatment. The nihu syndrome presents a spectrum of somatic and psychical symptoms that must be treated relevantly by appeasing the concerned \"maternal uncle\" before the condition deteriorates. In traditional Karbi society, the eventuality of nihu, if not treated methodically, may lead to extreme madness. The cure is desirably sought by performing rigorous socio-religious rituals, one of which is the needful feeding of the rice balls by the maternal uncle. Considerably, the anomalies observed during such illness may include onychophagia, mucophagy, absentmindedness, sickness, and anemic, rectal-prolapse, aggressiveness, parental alienation syndrome, shamelessness, pica, nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting), encopresis (particularly defecating on the bed), nudity, and other physical illnesses conceived to be incurable by medical care.

      "abstract": "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related death in patients with refractory epilepsy. Convergent lines of evidence suggest that SUDEP occurs due to seizure induced perturbation of respiratory, cardiac, and electrocerebral function as well as potential predisposing factors. It has been consistently observed that SUDEP happens more during the night and the early hours of the morning. The aim of this review is to discuss evidence from patient cases, clinical studies, and animal research which is pertinent to the nocturnality of SUDEP. There are a number of factors which might contribute to the nighttime predilection of SUDEP. These factors fall into four categories: influences of (1) being unwitnessed, (2) lying prone in bed, (3) sleep-wake state, and (4) circadian rhythms. During the night, seizures are more likely to be unwitnessed; therefore, it is less likely that another person would be able to administer a lifesaving intervention. Patients are more likely to be prone on a bed following a nocturnal seizure. Being prone in the accoutrements of a bed during the postictal period might impair breathing and increase SUDEP risk. Sleep typically happens at night and seizures which emerge from sleep might be more dangerous. Lastly, there are circadian changes to physiology during the night which might facilitate SUDEP. These possible explanations for the nocturnality of SUDEP are not mutually exclusive. The increased rate of SUDEP during the night is likely multifactorial involving both situational factors, such as being without a witness and prone, and physiological changes due to the influence of sleep and circadian rhythms. Understanding the causal elements in the nocturnality of SUDEP may be critical to the development of effective preventive countermeasures.",

      "abstract": "Aim : To review what is known about the role of sleep and arousal mechanisms in the pathogenesis of nocturnal enuresis. Methods : A review of the literature was carried out. Results : The sleep of enuretic children, although polysomnographically quite normal, is exceedingly “deep”; that is enuretic children have high arousal thresholds. Apart from some overlap between enuresis and the (other) classic parasomnias, the sleep of enuretic children is no more problematic than that of the general population. Recently, the exciting possibility has arisen that the low arousability of enuretic children may be linked to the autonomous nervous system and to disturbances in the upper pons. Conclusions : Enuresis is not just a nocturnal problem but a disorder of sleep. The high arousal threshold is one of three major pathogenetic factors in enuresis—nocturnal polyuria and detrusor hyperactivity being the other two.",

      "abstract": "Patients with idiopathic parkinsonism suffer from a neurodegenerative disorder of the nervous system. Due to a progressive loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) develop problems with motor and non-motor functions. On the motor level the dysfunctions defect the voluntary movements and lead to symptoms like: rigidity, resting tremor and bradykinesia [1]. On the level of cognition PD patients have problems with the executive functions, cognitive flexibility, working memory and control of attention [2]. Furthermore, the speech system gets affected which often leads to dysarthric speech. This hypokinetic dysarthria impacts the phonation, articulation and the respiratory system. The speech deficits include monoloudness, monopitch, reduced stress, imprecise articulation, variability of speech rate, disfluencies and voice tremor [3, 4, 5].PD affects communication as well as other related functions such as cognition, but complex prosodic aspects such as focus marking are less well studied. Prominence marking in German requires changes in intonation and articulation [6]. Speakers use multiple cues in the phonetic domain to regulate prosodic marking [7], e.g. modulation of F0 and syllable duration. Furthermore, there is insufficient literature on the impact of cognition on these phonetic aspects of prominence marking. The aim of this study is to analyse how prosodic prominence correlates with motoric and cognitive abilities in patients with Parkinson’s disease in the complex process of speech production.",

Developmental delay is present when a child does not reach developmental milestones at the expected age (with adequate leeway for the broad variation among normal children). Although delay may result primarily from a biological factor such as a chromosomal disorder, or an environmental factor such as maternal depression, the principal model for the causes of developmental delay is a ‘transactional’ one. The process of development is viewed as a transaction between the child and the environment, in which each can have profound effects on the other. About 15% of children have developmental delay. Many, however, are not detected before commencing school, mainly because the disabilities are mild or because they relate to tasks only then attempted by the child. Of the 15%, a much smaller proportion has more severe disability. This group is more likely to present earlier because of the severity of their problems, because there is more often an associated medical condition, and because a number of them (such as those with extreme prematurity) are picked up by at-risk screening programs.",

      "title": "1181 Rock Around the Clock: Non-24 Sleep-Wake Disorder Successfully Treated with Circadian Entrainment, a Case Series",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD) is a circadian rhythm disorder characterized by an inability to entrain to the 24-hour environment. It can occur in both blind and sighted individuals- usually with a longer sleep period, advanced temperature rhythm, and higher sensitivity to light than normal controls. Current therapies, derived from treating N24SWD in the blind and the human phase response curve, typically involve timed melatonin administration. It is more complex in sighted individuals, requiring multiple time cues such as light, melatonin, social interactions, feeding, and activity. We present two cases of non-24 sleep-wake disorder in sighted individuals who were successfully treated with circadian entrainment. Report of case(s) Report of Cases: Case 1: Sighted 31-year-old unemployed male with ADHD, presented with an irregular sleep pattern. He reported a lack of routine, prolonged dim basement computer use, and a circadian rhythm appearing longer than 24 hours. Actigraphy and sleep diaries confirmed N24SWD. Comprehensive measures, including timed light and melatonin therapy, blue light blocking glasses, and activity scheduling, led to a subjective \"miraculous\" improvement, with follow-up actigraphy confirming resolution. Case 2: Sighted 23-year-old female with autism and affective disorders presented with shifting sleep times alternating with prolonged video-game use. Actigraphy and sleep diaries were consistent with N24SWD. Following a prescribed schedule with light therapy, timed melatonin, and activity scheduling led to circadian alignment, confirmed by sleep diaries and patient report. Conclusion Effectively managing N24SWD in sighted individuals is challenging, as evidenced by limited treatment success and total cases documented in the literature, including challenges in long-term patient adherence. This case series highlights two successful instances of entrainment using a combination of timed melatonin, bright and low light therapy and activity scheduling, supported by actigraphy and diaries reflecting adaptation. These cases provide insights into contributors to the development of N24SWD and methods for resolving them. Support (if any)",

Signs and symptoms of central nervous system dysfunction may be attributed to more common childhood conditions. We aim to educate on the diagnosis and treatment of central sleep apnea in this vulnerable patient population. Report of Cases: A 12-year-old girl presents for initial sleep visit with global developmental delay, borderline obesity, chronic headaches, early morning tremors, and insulin resistance. She has history of snoring and restless sleep for years with severe daytime sleepiness for the past three months with worsening over two to four weeks. She is unable to stay awake in school. Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score is twenty-one. There is history of recurrent Strep but no history of infectious mononucleosis or influenza infection. Primary sleep disorders or CNS hypersomnia are suspected, and polysomnogram with MSLT is ordered. MRI of the brain is pending. The patient presents to the emergency department ten days later with frontal headaches, ataxia, altered speech, and oral aversion. CT head is normal. Hematology, neurology, and neurosurgery are consulted. MRI of the brain shows thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, the right transverse sinus, the right sigmoid sinus, the right jugular bulb, as well as cortical veins overlying both cerebral hemispheres, and she is started on anticoagulation for suspected stroke. A polysomnogram shows a severe degree of central sleep apnea with a central apnea index of 49.9 events per hour. There is significant periodic breathing present. There is no nonapneic hypoxemia or sleep hypoventilation present, and the patient is scheduled for an oxygen titration study. Conclusion Central sleep apnea is more prevalent in older male individuals and may affect patients with heart failure1.Pediatricians and subspecialists must remain vigilant as children are also susceptible to medical conditions which result in central nervous system dysfunction.

      "abstract": "Hearing impairment is so often an invisible disability that it does not often enter the awareness of those whose senses are intact. A textbook knowledge of the physiology and pathology of hearing does not prepare the clinician to cope with a hearing-impaired family member, friend, or colleague, with whom we feel embarrassed, lest our raised voices attract too much attention. We are even less prepared to evaluate or treat hearing-impaired persons in the course of our professional activities. Yet hearing impairment is common, and the profoundly deaf probably suffer mental disorders at a rate in excess of that of their hearing peers. Profound deafness, the absence of functional or remediable hearing, is extremely disabling. Profound deafness that occurs prior to complete acquisition of verbal language is socially and psychiatrically devastating. , · Such deafness, also known as prelingual deafness, is believed to result in uneven, incomplete, or arrested personality developmentl· 4 and behavioral disturbances, S the understanding of which is complicated by the natural language barrier.

It represents an inborn defence mechanism as a kind of protection from different potential dangers, and it manifests on a physical, cognitive and behavioural level. Physically it shows through faster heart beat, redness, heavier breathing, sweating, muscle tension, etc. On a cognitive level it can manifestin form of forgetfulness, concentration difficulty, negative thoughts, self-consciousness, etc. In terms of behaviour it becomes apparent through crying and screaming, teeth chattering and lip twitching, stuttering, thumb sucking, etc. Fear occurs in the second half of the child’s first year, and according to available research, younger children and girls experience a bigger number of fears than older children and boys. We can commonly see developmental fears in children, what is a normal occurrence at a certain age. They occur, change and spontaneously disappear when a child outgrows a certain developmental phase. During every developmental phase there are specific fears that have a certain function for that age. Children can be afraid of unknown people, separation, darkness and imaginary creatures, injuries, catastrophes, failure, lack of acceptance, ridicule, etc. Although developmental fears usually pass by themselves, and are an integral part to a child’s development, they can become intense and lasting so that they interfere with the child’s everyday life. In those cases expert help is needed. Fears in children can be a result of crisis situations, such as illness or hospitalisation of the child, illness of family members, divorce of the parents, death of family members, violence in the family and abuse in the family. Traumatised children generally suffer from more visible fears and tension and often expert help is necessary.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders and stroke are intricately linked through a complex, bidirectional relationship. Sleep disturbances such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, and restless legs syndrome (RLS) not only increase the risk of stroke but also frequently emerge as consequences of cerebrovascular events. OSA, in particular, is associated with a two- to three-fold increased risk of incident stroke, primarily through mechanisms involving intermittent hypoxia, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation. Conversely, stroke can disrupt sleep architecture and trigger or exacerbate sleep disorders, including insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm disturbances, and breathing-related sleep disorders. These post-stroke sleep disturbances are common and significantly impair rehabilitation, cognitive recovery, and quality of life, yet they remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. Early identification and management of sleep disorders in stroke patients are essential to optimize recovery and reduce the risk of recurrence. Therapeutic strategies include lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatments, medical devices such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and emerging alternatives for CPAP-intolerant individuals. Despite growing awareness, significant knowledge gaps persist, particularly regarding non-OSA sleep disorders and their impact on stroke outcomes. Improved diagnostic tools, broader screening protocols, and greater integration of sleep assessments into stroke care are urgently needed. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the interplay between sleep and stroke, emphasizing the importance of personalized, multidisciplinary approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Advancing research in this field holds promise for reducing the global burden of stroke and improving long-term outcomes through targeted sleep interventions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter reviews age-related changes in sleep, circadian rhythms, and sleep disorders in adults and older adults. With advancing age there are major changes in sleep, including sleep timing, the amount of slow-wave sleep, the number of nocturnal awakenings, sleep consolidation, and total sleep time. There are also changes in circadian rhythmicity with aging, including a reduced amplitude of some circadian rhythms and some evidence for reduced sensitivity to light. The interaction between the sleep and circadian regulatory systems also changes with age, resulting in greater difficulty sleeping during the biological daytime, the nocturnal sleep episode occurring at earlier circadian phases than in young adults, and a reduced ability to obtain a long and consolidated sleep episode. In addition to these general changes in sleep and circadian rhythmicity with aging, the sleep of many older people is impacted by a higher prevalence of specific sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movements of sleep, and rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder; and they are also more likely to have chronic medical problems that interfere with sleep and to take medications that either disrupt nighttime sleep or impact daytime alertness.",

      "title": "A CASE OF SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITOR‐INDUCED RAPID EYE MOVEMENT BEHAVIOR DISORDER",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is often seen in older patients and is characterized by a loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep.1,2 As a result, the disease manifests as nocturnal motor activity consistent with the enactment of dream content, for example grabbing the bed partner in response to a dream about falling from a cliff. RBD often results in injury to the patient, bed partner, or both.1,2 In perhaps up to two-thirds of cases, RBD is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, most notably the alpha-synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease, multiple systems atrophy), often antedating other manifestations of these disorders by many years.1–4 Other cases seem to be idiopathic, although it has been suggested that various medications, notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and other antidepressants, may commonly induce RBD.1,4,5 In spite of this assertion, there have been few supporting case reports.5,6 The authors recently cared for a man who clearly developed RBD as a result of SSRI treatment; the use of the SSRI for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) complicated the clinical picture. An 87-year-old male World War II veteran had been treated for PTSD with associated nightmares but no nocturnal motor activity with bupropion and lorazepam. Past medical history was significant only for essential hypertension. In 1998, after many years of treatment, sertraline was added because of increasing symptoms. Within 6 months of adding sertraline, the patient developed frequent nocturnal motor behavior consistent with the content of his dreams and nightmares, for example punching and choking his wife in the context of a dream about being in a fight. As a result, he and his wife had suffered lacerations and contusions. Other behaviors included running out of his bedroom or running into a window. Upon awakening, he was able to recall portions of the dreams but was unaware of the motor behaviors. Trials of temazepam, zolpidem, and trazodone were ineffective in improving these behaviors. Ultimately, a diagnosis of RBD was made based on the clinical presentation. Clonazepam 1 mg at bedtime was added, which resulted in a moderate decrease in the frequency of the nocturnal motor activity, from nightly to two or three times per week. After 3 months, sertraline was slowly tapered and discontinued, which resulted in a complete cessation of all nocturnal motor behavior. He remained free of nocturnal motor activity for 5 months, until sertraline was inadvertently restarted after the loss of his wife. Within 1 month of restarting sertraline, the nocturnal motor behavior returned. There has thus far been no evidence of dementia or of parkinsonism. This patient's clinical presentation was typical of RBD; unfortunately, his and his wife's injuries were also typical. It seems clear that his RBD was SSRI induced; it developed after sertraline was started, did not definitively improve until it was stopped, and recurred after it was inadvertently restarted, and there was no evidence of parkinsonism or dementia over the previous 12 years. Although there are few published cases of SSRI-induced overt RBD, increased electromyography activity during REM sleep has been demonstrated in patients taking SSRIs. (None of the patients were being treated for PTSD.)7 The relationship between RBD and PTSD is complex and not fully investigated. There is clinical and polysomnographic evidence of greater motor activity during REM sleep in patients with PTSD,8 and greater prevalence of RBD was noted in a cohort of patients with PTSD.9 SSRIs are effective for PTSD-related nightmares10 but may cause RBD, clonazepam is effective for RBD1,2,4 but not for PTSD-related nightmares,10 and RBD is not associated with the typical diurnal symptoms of PTSD. In spite of his long history of PTSD and related nightmares, this patient had never exhibited any significant motor activity during sleep until the SSRI was started. RBD is relatively common in geriatric practice and should be explored in any patient with nocturnal injuries or motor activity. RBD responds well to treatment, generally with clonazepam. Discontinuation of SSRIs or changing to a different class of antidepressant (if feasible) may also be a viable option for some patients.

      "abstract": "Abstract Oro-Pharyngeal Dysphagia - or simply dysphagia - is the difficulty (persistent) in swallowing/passing food and/or liquid from the mouth to the pharynx into the esophagus and finally the stomach; a deglutition disorder (a symptom, by definition, often due to neuro-degenerative/−muscular, drug-induced or localized structural pathologies such as head and neck tumors, lesions and associated surgical and/or radiation injuries) linked to severe consequences on Quality of Life (QoL), including malnutrition, dehydration, and even sudden death. Likewise, Temporo-Mandibular Jaw and Joint disorder(s) – or simply TMD – is a multifactorial etiological condition, regularly encountered in the dental office. Whether due to malocclusion, bruxism, stress and/or trauma, TMD destabilizes the whole cranio-mandibular system structurally and functionally, via affecting mastication, teeth, supporting structures, comfort and aesthetics, and thus, QoL, again. While several treatment regimens do exist for such conditions, some of which have been standardized for use over the years, most continue to lack proper evidence-based literature support. Hence, (1) caution is to be exercised; and (2) the need for alternative therapeutic strategies is amplified, subsequently, the door for innovation is wide open. Indeed, neuromuscular electrical stimulation or “NMES”, is perhaps a fine example. Herein, we present the interested oro-dental health care provider with an up-dated revision of this therapeutic modality, its potential benefits, risks and concerns, to best handle the dysphagic patient: an intra-disciplinary approach or strategy bridging contemporary dentistry with speech and language therapy; a rather obscure and un-discovered yet critical allied health profession . A pre-clinical and clinical prospectus on employing inventive NMES-based regimens and devices to manage TMD is also highlighted.",

      "title": "Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: A Review",
      "abstract": "Context: Nocturnal enuresis or bedwetting is the most common type of urinary incontinence in children. It has significant psychological effects on both the child and the family. Enuresis nocturna is defined as the inability to hold urine during the night in children who have completed toilet training. It is termed as being \"primary\" if no continence has ever been achieved or \"secondary if it follows at least 6 months of dry nights. The aim of this review was to assemble the pathophysiological background and general information about nocturnal enuresis. Evidence Acquisition: This review was performed by evaluating the literature on nocturnal enuresis published between 1970 and 2015, available via PubMed and using the keywords \"nocturnal enuresis,\" \"incontinence,\" \"pediatric,\" \"review,\" and \"treatment.\" Results: Children with nocturnal enuresis produce urine at higher rates during the night, and may have lower bladder capacities. Some children with nocturnal enuresis may also have daytime urgency, frequency, and urinary incontinence. Treatment includes aggressive treatment of accompanying constipation or urinary tract infections, behavioral changes, and medical therapy. Alarm therapy remains the first-line treatment modality for primary nocturnal enuresis. High rates of patient compliance and relapse mean that alternative treatments remain on the agenda. Conclusions: Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem that has multifaceted effects on both the child and the family. Due to multiple etiologic factors, nocturnal enuresis is still not clearly defined.",

The clinical presentation includes vertigo which is episodic, sensorineural hearing loss which fluctuates, tinnitus and sensation of fullness of ear (aural fullness). Associated complaints includes headache, nausea, drop attacks (otolith crisis of Tumarkin). Meniere’s disease is relapsing in nature which greatly affects patient’s daily activities. The highest prevalent age group is 30-60 years of age. The main pathology occurs as the result of endolymphatic sac distension caused by excessive production or faulty absorption of endolymph or both. The cause is not known clearly. But few factors may contribute in the pathophysiology of Meniere’s disease like excessive retention of water and sodium, allergic reactions, vasomotor disorders, auto immune disorders like rheumatoid fever, middle ear infections etc. Acharya Sushruta has explained Karnarogas like Karnanaada, Karnakshweda, Badhirya which are nearer to Meniere’s disease when studied along with Bhrama. 22 subjects diagnosed with Meniere’s Disease fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected for the study. Amapachana was done with Shunthi churna. Nasya with Bhringaraja taila followed by Karnapoorana with Bilva Taila and Sarivadi vati along with Dhanwayasa Kashaya and Satwavajaya chikitsa was given.

The occurrence of a medical illness does not eliminate the possibility of Illness Anxiety Disorder.

Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s).

The necessity to act, and the urgency of the act in adolescence has been observed as well in adolescents that have health problems as in adolescents in good health. It is not possible to separate the acts that are symptoms of a pathological organization from the acts that are an expression of a normal psychology, but there is a tendency to conceive as psychopathological that which comes into conflict with, and that which is a transgression to, the laws of the social environment, and the biological laws. It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

      "title": "Prevalence of symptoms associated with respiratory illness in children and young people with cerebral palsy",
      "abstract": "SIR–Population registry studies in Sweden and Australia have shown that survival for young people with cerebral palsy (CP) in developed countries has not improved during the past 40 years, and certainly not for individuals with severe motor impairments.1, 2 These studies also indicate that premature death in individuals with CP is most often due to respiratory causes, resulting from aspiration and/or pneumonia. The development of serious respiratory illness in young people with CP probably results from a number of contributing factors.3 Impaired swallowing, poor coordination of breathing with swallowing during meals, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and seizures may all lead to pulmonary aspiration. Aspiration may be recognized by signs such as choking, coughing, and changes to breathing and voice; but it can also be silent.4 Chronic coughing, chestiness, or wheeziness may indicate the presence of recurrent aspiration. Individuals with more severe gross motor function impairment would be expected to have a higher risk of respiratory illness, partly because of their reduced physical activity (associated with reduced chest expansion and respiratory muscle strength), and partly because they have more comorbidities. Scoliosis may also be a risk factor because it reduces lung capacity and because of its association with severe gross motor impairment and other comorbidities. Although many clinicians and researchers would agree that these factors probably contribute to the development of severe respiratory illness in children and young people with CP, this is based more on clinical reasoning than on research evidence. There is surprisingly little empirical literature describing the development of respiratory illness in this population. We have recently described associations between respiratory symptoms and oromotor dysfunction in CP,5 but neither we nor other researchers have published findings on the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in this cohort. In this letter, we wish to do this, and to make a few comments on the interpretation and implications of these data. We had two outcome measures of respiratory illness: (1) at least two courses of antibiotics and (2) at least one hospitalization during the previous year. Table 1 shows the factors that we found to be statistically significantly associated with one or both of these measures in 551 individuals, aged 1 to 26 years, with CP. It indicates the prevalence of these factors in the entire sample and at each Gross Motor Impairment Function Classification System (GMFCS) level. The lower part of the table shows the percentages of individuals at each GMFCS level who took nutrition by the following methods: without modifications, orally but with food texture modifications, orally and by tube, and by tube only (nil by mouth). Table 1 indicates that individuals at GMFCS level V have much higher rates of most of these symptoms than individuals at the other GMFCS levels. Our research suggests that this is not due to their gross motor function per se, but to their difficulties eating and drinking. The few individuals at GMFCS levels IV and V who had neither food modifications nor a tube had no higher risk of respiratory illness than individuals at GMFCS levels I to III with no food modifications. This suggests oropharyngeal motor or sensory dysfunction, and perhaps a reduced ability to coordinate breathing and swallowing in the group with higher rates of respiratory symptoms. The presence of at least one respiratory symptom during or directly after meals was reported by nearly half of the respondents (46.4%). Mealtime symptoms were reported by some respondents in each category of method of nutritional intake: those with no food modifications (36.4%), those with oral intake and food texture modifications (87.5%), those with oral intake plus tube (82.1%), and those who took all nutrition by tube and nil by mouth (71.4%). Non-oral intake (tube only) does not entirely prevent symptoms suggestive of aspiration, possibly because of ongoing gastro-oesophageal reflux and salivary aspiration, and possibly also because respiratory disease is sometimes already established by the time that mealtime interventions are introduced. These results also raise a question about whether the one-third of respondents with no food modifications who nevertheless report mealtime symptoms would benefit from food texture modifications to reduce aspiration. For any child, the decision to modify diet and/or use non-oral methods of intake is an individual one, and will depend on a diverse range of factors, including safety, maintenance of a healthy body weight, and quality of life. To enable informed decision-making, aspiration and risk of later respiratory disease should be discussed among these other factors. In conclusion, respiratory symptoms are common in children with CP, especially those at GMFCS level V. Respiratory symptoms at meals are also very prevalent. It is important to consider the risk of respiratory illness associated with pulmonary aspiration in these individuals. The study was funded by Health Networks Funding from the Western Australian Health Department.",

There is a strong genetic influence in SE; when both parents suffer from SE, almost 75% of their children are expected to be also enuretic, while the prevalence of SE in the offspring of two parents who were not enuretic during childhood is only 15%. Several polysomnographic studies reported that children with SE have normal sleep architecture, in terms of proportion and distribution of sleep stages during night.

      "title": "Chronic insomnia: a practical review.",
      "abstract": "Insomnia has numerous, often concurrent etiologies, including medical conditions, medications, psychiatric disorders and poor sleep hygiene. In the elderly, insomnia is complex and often difficult to relieve because the physiologic parameters of sleep normally change with age. In most cases, however, a practical management approach is to first consider depression, medications, or both, as potential causes. Sleep apnea also should be considered in the differential assessment. Regardless of the cause of insomnia, most patients benefit from behavioral approaches that focus on good sleep habits. Exposure to bright light at appropriate times can help realign the circadian rhythm in patients whose sleep-wake cycle has shifted to undesirable times. Periodic limb movements during sleep are very common in the elderly and may merit treatment if the movements cause frequent arousals from sleep. When medication is deemed necessary for relief of insomnia, a low-dose sedating antidepressant or a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic may offer advantages over traditional sedative-hypnotics. Longterm use of long-acting benzodiazepines should, in particular, be avoided. Melatonin may be helpful when insomnia is related to shift work and jet lag; however, its use remains controversial.",

It presents the clinical history, examination, follow-up, treatment, diagnosis, and the results of the procedures performed on the patient. Actigraphic recordings for 2 weeks disclosed persistent muscular activity during the nocturnal period and two to five episodes per night of further enhanced muscular activity that corresponded to the eating episodes noted by the patient in his diary. The sleep medicine specialist established a diagnosis of sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) based on the clinical history and on the results of the video-polysomnography (PSG) recording. Low-dosage dopaminergic agents such as levodopa/carbidopa at bedtime, sometimes combined with codeine and/or clonazepam, bromocriptine and pramipexole, have been shown to reduce the eating episodes.",

Conversely, developmental delays and disabilities may themselves precipitate sleep disorders. Young children with developmental delays experience sleep disorders at a higher rate than do typically developing children; the most common types are difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep and sleep disordered breathing. To date, attention has been focused on sleep problems in children with specific conditions (e.g., autism, genetic syndromes, prematurity, and seizure disorder). The authors review evidence of sleep problems' broader impact across the range of children screened for early intervention. Eligibility evaluations for early intervention address the five developmental domains: adaptive, motor, cognitive, communication, and socioemotional. Disordered sleep may be symptomatic of socioemotional and adaptive problems. Assessing sleep problems within the evaluation may help establish eligibility for early intervention services and would maximize developmental potential by ensuring timely identification, referral, and treatment.",

      "title": "A Case of Interdose Discontinuation Symptoms With Venlafaxine Extended Release",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Suffering and the Dying Patient",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

A patient affected by anterograde amnesia, is temporarily less able to remember what he or she has experienced over a period of three months after treatment. The brain of a patient with retrograde amnesia is unable to retrieve or remember information or procedures 'saved' before the treatment took place. More specifically the patient with retrograde amnesia has three main types of problems: semantic memory problems (relating to facts), episodic memory problems (no longer able to retrieve memories concerning non-personal events), and procedural memory problems (no longer able to operate various devices). It is difficult to predict which patients will experience cognitive problems as a result from ect and to what extent. However, the problems are not intensified by maintenance treatment. Factual and autobiographical memory problems following ect-induced retrograde amnesia seems to have a more permanent character. According to the Dutch guidelines for ECT, cognitive side-effects need to be monitored. If patients are monitored before and after ect, they can be given a more targeted psycho-education and eventually a more targeted training course.We conclude that in clinical practice increasing attention is being given to ECT-related cognitive side-effects. Clearly, however, more consideration needs to be given to inter-individual variability. Cognitive monitoring is advisable because the course of the side-effects of ect must be followed and evaluated.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a frequent sleep-related breathing disorder in children with a prevalence of approximately 3% between the ages of 3 and 8. Its origin is multifactorial (hypertrophy of pharyngeal soft tissues, narrowing of the bone airways, damage to the neuromuscular tone). The symptoms and clinical signs to look for during the day and at night are directly related to upper airway (UA) obstruction or poor sleep quality. After a complete anamnestic and clinical evaluation, including nasofibroscopy, the ENT specialist will refer to an adeno-amygdalectomy or night recording by polysomnography or polygraph to confirm the diagnosis in the child. Among adolescents, the prevalence of OSAS is reported to be between 0.5 and 6%. The main risk factors are obesity, male sex and a history of tonsillectomy. In addition to the classic symptoms of childhood OSAS, this syndrome may, in adolescents, manifest itself as a misleading semiology of dyssomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and/or mood disorders. Differential diagnoses with risk behaviours, phase delay or narcolepsy should be systematically discussed. It is essential to record breathing during sleep. Even if the obstructive apnea/hypopnea index is low, it must be considered. In both children and adolescents, multidisciplinary management (ENT, orthodontist, maxillofacial physiotherapist, pulmonologist) should be early in order to avoid neurocognitive, behavioural, cardiovascular and metabolic complications. Maxillofacial surgery can be discussed from the age of 15. It is important not to forget to pay attention to the rules of healthy living and sleep as well as the management of obesity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Central sleep apnea (CSA) syndrome is defined when five or more central apneas and/or hypopneas are present per hour of sleep, more than 50% of all respiratory events. CSA usually occur during NREM stage and rarely during REM. CSA is important to recognize because of complications ranging from frequent nighttime awakenings,sleepiness to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We present a 40 year old female patient with rare CSA during REM sleep and dream enactment. Report of Case 40yo African American female with history of loud snoring, witnessed sleep apnea, and daytime fatigue. She reported nightmares, sleep talking, and acting out her dreams without injury. Epworth sleepiness score was 5 /24. Her past medical history is significant for depression and anxiety. She has no history of head trauma, no neurologic or cardiovascular disorders. Her medications include fluoxetine and,quetiapine. She denied substance use, narcotic use, or alcohol use. Her level 1 sleep study showed predominantly REM-associated central sleep apneas which is rare. She also was observed to have loss of REM sleep muscle atonia suggestive of REM Behavior disorder. Her sleep architecture was atypical with decreased N3 sleep stage. REM sleep duration was adequate. She was noted to have loss of REM muscle atonia based on AASM guidelins elevated chin EMG, excessive transient muscle activity, and witnessed movement during REM stage via video monitoring. During the study, she had an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 13.1 per hour of sleep, Central apneas were predominantly noted during REM stage, 10 per hour, comprised of 50% of her respiratory events. The minimum SpO2 value with CSA was 94%. She had normal sinus rhythm. Her sleep was fragmented. A total arousals were 28.4/hour,and 7.9/hour were respiratory arousals, and the rest were spontaneous arousals. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 to 60 %. Her room air arterial blood gas was normal with PaC02 of 37 mmHg. MRI of the brain/brainstem was ordered given her atypical REM sleep. She had no acute intracranial abnormalities. There is a non specific finding of a low lying cerebellar tonsils without evidence of Chiari I malformation. Conclusion Our patient has rare idiopathic central apnea in REM stage and is third case reported. She also has loss of muscle atonia during REM with dream enactment which is also rare in her age group. Injury precaution advised.",

      "abstract": "Both depression and conduct disorders are relatively prevalent and are related to poor long-term outcomes. Despite being characterized by very different symptoms, it is well established that these two disorders co-occur at higher rates than expected by chance, resulting in poorer adjustment for the individual than would result from either problem alone. The term<italic>comorbidity</italic>is usually reserved to refer to the association of diagnosed disorders, whereas<italic>co-occurrence</italic>refers more broadly to the association of levels of symptoms of conduct problems and depression, which are usually calculated with means or possibly symptoms counts. In the past two decades, researchers have focused particularly on the following issues regarding the comorbidity of depression and conduct disorder: (1) possible causal associations of the two problem behaviors (i.e., do depressive disorders tend to onset after conduct disorders or vice versa); (2) theory regarding causes of the association (i.e., common versus unique risk factors for these two problem behaviors); (3) changes across development (i.e., with age); (4) risks from diagnosed disorders versus symptoms that do not reach diagnostic criteria; (5) outcomes or prognosis (e.g., are outcomes more severe for co-occurring problems than for either problem alone, are there distinct patterns of outcomes associated with co-occurring problems). Within each of these areas there is considerable interest in moderation of effects by gender or gender similarities and differences. This chapter reviews findings pertaining to these issues and presents suggestions for future research. In addition, assessment approaches and clinical implications are discussed.",

Anecdotal reports (1) indicate that the beneficial effect of sleep deprivation may be reversed by naps even as short as 90 seconds during the day fol lowing the sleepless night. This paradoxical phenomenon, that sleeplessness ameliorates depressive symptomatology and that depression usually returns after the next night of sleep or even after short naps, raises the question, if in depressed patients, sleep may have a depressiogenic influence? N a p studies conducted up to now draw an inconsistent picture. G i l l i n et a l .

This effect was, however, confounded with a longer sleep length in the patients wi th R E M n a p s .

      "abstract": "About one third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience hallucinations, mostly of a complex visual type, less often auditory or tactile. Minor hallucinatory phenomena, including sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions are frequent. Hallucinations primarily occur in a context of clear sensorium in patients with longstanding PD. They are more frequent in the evening or during the night. Insight in the hallucinatory nature of the phenomenon may be retained, partial, fluctuating, or abolished. An altered insight is common when cognitive impairment is present, and may be associated with delusions and (or) delusional misidentifications. Pharmacological factors such as dopaminergic treatment clearly trigger or increase the occurence of hallucinations in PD. However, in the recent years, emphasis has been made on disease-related factors including cognitive impairment, diurnal somnolence, visual disorders (either contrast and color discrimination impairment due to PD, or coincident ocular disorders), long duration of PD, late onset, severe axial impairment and autonomic dysfunction. The pathophysiology of hallucinations of PD is poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial. The first steps of the treatment consist in giving information and reassurance to the patient and his/her caregiver, re-evaluating the antiparkinsonian treatment and associated medications, and evaluating the patient for mood disorder, visual impairment, and cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors, when prescribed for associated cognitive impairment, may be beneficial on hallucinations. In the more severe forms, clozapine has been proved to be safe and effective.",

Severe illness in the newborn, regardless of the underlying cause, tends to manifest itself in a rather stereotypic way with relatively nonspecific findings, such as poor feeding, drowsiness, lethargy, hypotonia, and failure to thrive. Because inherited metabolic diseases are individually rare, clinicians have a tendency to pursue the possibility only after other more common conditions, such as sepsis, have been excluded. Further delay often occurs because the type of investigation required to make the diagnosis of inherited metabolic disease includes unfamiliar tests, which the clinician may feel uncomfortable interpreting owing to a general lack of confidence regarding metabolic problems.",

      "abstract": "Normal conscious behaviour means awareness of self and the environment and depends on intact brain function.'Changes in the level of consciousness reflect an abnormal function of the brain.The degree, depth, and duration of altered consciousness may vary from drowsiness to brain death, and \"coma\" or un- consciousness is best defined as an inability to obey commands, utter recognisable words, or open the eyes.2Pathological conditions associated with this state are brain injury from trauma; cerebrovascular accidents; hypoxia; hypotension (low perfusion states); uncontrolled epilepsy; and disorders of metabolism, such as hepatic and renal failure and drug overdose.As well as managing the primary cause of the coma, energetic treatment is needed to prevent the complications of unconscious- ness, the most serious of which are hypoxia and hypotension.All unconscious patients run the risk of an obstructed airway from the tongue falling back into the oropharynx.The inability to cough or swallow leads to an accumulation of secretions in the mouth, pharynx, trachea, and bronchi.Vomit and regurgitated gastric contents may be inhaled giving rise to the acid-aspiration (Mendelson's) syndrome in the lungs.The already damaged brain cannot withstand any further insults that may occur from inadequate cerebral oxygenation and perfusion due to a low arterial Po2 or low blood pressure.3The unconscious patient may need total care for days, weeks, or months, the problems being those of maintaining vital functions (adequate ventilation, circulation, and nutrition) and general nursing care.Anaesthesia is a pharmacologically induced state of uncon- sciousness and the well-trained anaesthetists of today, with their skill in care of the airway, endotracheal intubation, intravenous cannulation, ventilator management, and knowledge of applied pharmacology and respiratory physiology, are particularly able to care for these patients.The skills and lessons learnt in the operating theatre have enabled them to take part in the development, organisation, and management of patients in immediate care schemes and intensive treatment units and to teach these skills to other doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, and ambulance men.",

Insomnia is a syndrome with multiple causes including medications, other illnesses and environmental factors. An accurate diagnosis is needed for effective management. Sleep disturbances are associated with functional and cognitive impairment and excess mortality. Management should initially be non-pharmacological including sleep hygiene education and behavioural therapy. Medications, including benzodiazepines (BZDs), are second-line with little evidence to support long-term usage. BZD usage in older people is associated with a range of disorders including falls, accidents and cognitive impairment. The management of insomnia in specific situations such as residential care, those with dementia and depressed older people can be challenging. Additional research is needed, particularly on the risks/benefit of long-term pharmacotherapy and to determine whether therapy reduces the consequences of sleep disturbances.",

Insomnia can occur alone or in combination with other medical or psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis and management of insomnia at times are perplexing. This updated study review aimed at a clinical algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in adults. We developed an easy-to-apply algorithm to diagnose and manage insomnia that can be used by general practitioners and non-sleep specialists. To this end, our team reviewed the previous studies to determine the prevalence, evaluation, and treatment of insomnia. We used the results to develop a clinical algorithm for diagnosing and managing insomnia. Insomnia occurs in a short (less than 3 months duration) or chronic form (≥3 months duration). Insomnia management includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. There is ample research evidence for the impact of a variety of non-pharmacological treatments, but both types of treatments can be used for each patient. If there are any contradictions in the diagnosis process, therapists should use objective instruments, such as polysomnography, but they should not be in a hurry to use these instruments.",

Patients showed substantial neuropsychological deficits, fragmented nocturnal sleep and, in half the patients, sleep apnea and/or hypopnea both mainly of central type. There was no statistically significant correlation between the degree of daytime cognitive deficit and the degree of sleep fragmentation or of respiratory problems at night. It was concluded that the neuropsychological deficit in mytonic dystrophy cannot be attributed to a secondary effect of nocturnal sleep apnea or sleep disruption but probably represents a direct effect of CNS lesions.",

Idiopathic RBD patients, especially those with abnormal dopamine transporter uptake imaging, hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra, hyposmia and color vision damage are those with high risk to develop PD, DLB and MSA. RBD may not be considered as a parasomnia but rather as an integral part of a neurodegenerative disease. Clonazepam (0.5-4 mg) and melatonin (3-12 mg) at bed time improve the symptoms of RBD but does not prevent the conversion to a neurodegenerative disease.",

The most important conceptual change in our understanding of insomnia, defined in the National Institutes of Health 2005 consensus conference, is that insomnia is a disorder itself rather than a symptom of another disorder. Specifically, insomnia is a disorder of hyperarousal. Insomniacs do not have an abnormal sleep homeostat or circadian system but rather an overactivated wake system. Cognitively, patients often complain they cannot “shut [their] brain down.” Physiologic correlates include elevated brain metabolism, increased fast electroencephalographic activity, and increased autonomic, metabolic, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Treatment for insomnia can be divided into two categories, behavioral and pharmacologic. Another important categorization relates to self-treatment (sleep hygiene and over-the-counter drugs) versus clinician-directed therapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia [CBT-I] and prescribed hypnotics). Among behavioral treatments are sleep restriction, stimulus control, relaxation training, and cognitive therapy. The most widely used behavioral therapy is a combination of the four treatment components referred to collectively as CBT-I. The majority of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved hypnotics are drugs that occupy the benzodiazepine receptor site, which is part of the GABAA receptor complex. The hypnotic efficacy of the FDA-approved benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) has been well documented using objective polysomnography and subjective measures of sleep induction and duration. Many BzRA side effects are associated with the desired sedative effects of the drug and relate to the pharmacokinetics, receptor subtype affinities, and dose of the drug.

Pediatric cases of narcolepsy generally remain unrecognized and undiagnosed. Clinical heterogeneity, prolonged onset and diverse symptoms contribute to the delay in diagnosis and treatment in childhood. Case. This report describes a case of narcolepsy in an 8,5-year-old male patient who was misdiagnosed as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and many other diagnoses at different hospitals over a period of 3 years before the correct diagnosis was made. Conclusions. Narcolepsy in children is a rare neurological syndrome, which can occur with uncommon and atypical clinical presentations.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Sleep disturbance in a growing problem in the general population. As the prevalence of sleep disturbance rises, interest in treatment modalities including non-pharmaceutical interventions also grows. One of these potential modalities is exercise therapy. In individuals without sleep disorders, exercise appears to be beneficial in improving sleep architecture without any impact of the timing of exercise in relation to onset of sleep. The mechanisms for this are largely unknown but may be due to a combination of the effects of exercise on body temperature, autonomic control, endocrine and metabolic function. In obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), supervised exercise therapy appears to have positive impact on daytime sleepiness with an unknown impact on sleep quality. The effect of exercise on central sleep apnoea (CSA) will be difficult to ascertain due to the low prevalence of this condition. In primary sleep disorders such as insomnia, narcolepsy and restless syndrome exercise may be useful in improving sleep architecture but the quality of the evidence supporting this remains low. In addition, the timing of exercise in relation to sleep onset remains under investigated. In individuals with circadian rhythm disorders, evening exercise appears to delay sleep onset. In shift-pattern workers, individuals with increased cardiorespiratory fitness report better sleep quality, suggesting exercise may be protective in this important population. To allow high quality evidence-based recommendations to be made about the value of exercise in individuals with sleep disorders, there is a significant need for large prospective studies with objective and subjective sleep quality as a primary outcome.",

      "abstract": "Convulsive status epilepticus is a common emergency condition in paediatric practice. Classically, it is defined as continuous or recurrent seizure activity lasting for longer than 30 min in which the patient does not regain baseline mental status.1 Commonly, intervention is recommended after only 5 min of seizure activity2 as neuronal damage may begin to occur after this period, and the longer a seizure continues, the less likely it is to stop spontaneously.3 It seems likely, however, that mortality and morbidity after prolonged seizures should often be dependent upon underlying aetiology rather than duration of seizure activity.4 Repetitive serial seizures (ie, seizure clusters with return to baseline between events, but occurring frequently enough to be highly disruptive) and non-convulsive status epilepticus are also relatively common in children with epilepsy and are associated with significant morbidity.5\n\nDiazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, the drugs most widely used to stop prolonged seizures, are members of the benzodiazepine family, a class of psychoactive drugs with varying hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties.6 Differences in their affinity for receptor subtypes account for different pharmacological effects, in combination with widely varying pharmacokinetic profiles. These pharmacokinetic differences often impose specific routes of administration and specific formulations for individual members of the benzodiazepine family. The aim of this review is to detail their clinical pharmacology as it relates to their use in the management of prolonged seizures in children.\n\nBenzodiazepines produce their range of effects by modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABAA). The GABAA receptor comprises five subunits; each receptor is assembled from a combination of polypeptides, most commonly two αs, two βs and one γ, although several other subunits exist (eg, δ, e, π, θ and ρ).7 The combination of different subunits governs the …",

      "title": "REM Sleep Behavior Disorder",
      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a REM sleep parasomnia characterized by dream enactment during sleep. Patients act out during their dreams while being in the REM stage of sleep. Clinical features during sleep include abnormal vocalizations, abnormal motor behavior, and altered dream mentation. This enactment may be violent and can lead to injury to themselves or others without any conscious awareness. A patient can recall the contents of the dream upon awakening. Most patients with REM behavior disorder will eventually manifest neurodegenerative diseases like parkinsonism, dementia with Lewy body, or multisystem atrophy.There are also secondary causes of RBD associated with narcolepsy or use of antidepressant medications.A patient may be warned about the future development of these neurological disorders. Treatment consists of preventive measures while sleeping to avoid injury to the patient as well as the bed partner. In severe cases, the patient may be prescribed melatonin or clonazepam.",

      "title": "The Reciprocal Relationship between Sleep and Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "The relationship between sleep and epilepsy is bidirectional. Certain epilepsy syndromes predominantly or exclusively manifest during sleep, with seizures frequently originating from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Interictal epileptiform discharges observed on electroencephalograms are most likely to be activated during the deep NREM sleep stage known as N3. Conversely, epileptiform discharges, anti-seizure medications (ASMs), as well as other anti-seizure therapies can exert detrimental effects on sleep architecture. Moreover, the co-occurrence of sleep disorders has the potential to exacerbate seizure control. Understating the relationship between sleep and epilepsy is crucial for healthcare providers. Addressing and managing sleep-related problems in individuals with epilepsy can potentially contribute to improved seizure control and overall well-being. At the same time, improving seizure control can improve sleep quality and quantity, thus further improving the health of individuals with epilepsy.",

Sleep is regulated bycomplex interactions between wake-promoting and sleep-promoting neural circuits. Anestheticsexert their effects partly by inhibiting wake-promoting neurons or activating sleep-promotingneurons. Unconscious but arousable sedation is more related to sleep-wake circuitries,whereas unconscious and unarousable anesthesia is independent of them. Generalanesthesia is notable for its ability to decrease sleep propensity. Conversely, increasedsleep propensity due to insufficient sleep potentiates anesthetic effects. Taken together, it isplausible that sleep and anesthesia are closely related phenomena but not the same ones.Further investigations on the relationship between sleep and anesthesia are warranted.",

Baby-blues (prevalence 80%) is a feeling of sadness that doesn't need to be treated. It occurs around the third day of post-partum. Its intensity is a predictive factor of postnatal depression. Puerperal psychosis (prevalence 0.2%) is a disturbance of psychotic or manic proportion, mainly in women with a psychiatric previous history. It occurs between the first and the third week of the post-partum period. Postnatal depression (prevalence 20%) is a major depressive state commencing four to six weeks after delivery. It is rarely diagnosed early and child abuse is one of its consequences. Prevention--the important point of the treatment--is most of the time neglected.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe, chronic, and recurring mental disorder, which is frequently accompanied by co-occurring mental and somatic illnesses. Compelling evidence indicates that patients with MDD exhibit cognitive impairment encompassing several domains, including but not limited to, executive function, verbal memory, and attention. In addition, cognitive impairment may be evident even during remission and appears to play a major role in the persistence of psychosocial dysfunction (including impairment in workforce). Therefore, several compounds have been tested as putative cognitive enhancers for MDD. Although antidepressant treatment may be associated with modest improvements in some cognitive domains (namely psychomotor speed and delayed recall), evidence thus far remains unclear owing to methodological limitations across clinical trials. These methodological limitations include: (i) lack of adequate screening for cognitive dysfunction at baseline; (ii) the inclusion of samples that were not in remission at baseline; pseudospecificity (i.e. observed effects on cognition could be due to secondary improvement in mood); (iii) cognitive function was not the primary outcome in some trials; and (iv) lack of standardization of cognitive measures employed across studies. Replicated evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that vortioxetine and duloxetine may have procognitive effects. Furthermore, data from RCTs suggest that lisdexamfetamine, modafinil, metformin, and erythropoietin may also have beneficial cognitive effects. In conclusion, the achievement of cognitive remission remains an unmet goal in the treatment of MDD. Future research directions, including methodological improvements in the conduct of RCTs targeting MDD-related cognitive dysfunction, are discussed.",

As a mood state, depression is characterized by feeling despondent or unhappy, while depression as a mood disorder is a persistent set of symptoms as described in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV). Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibiity seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleo-vestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

It explores the etiology, prevalence, clinical features, diagnostic tools and criteria, and treatment options to identify sleep disorders early in the course. This is important to help improve youths in terms of education and quality of life. Recent findings Recent studies indicate that delayed sleep wake phase disorder has a range of prevalence between 1% and 16%. It is often associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (i.e. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder) as well as psychopathology (i.e. substance use, anxiety, and depression). It can present with a myriad of symptoms, such as insomnia, restless sleep, and poor daytime cognitive function, often seen in pediatric practice. Important diagnostic measures incorporate history-taking, sleep logs, actigraphy (i.e. Apple watches) and measurement of dim light melatonin onset. Treatments include improved sleep hygiene, chronotherapy, exogenous melatonin administration, and bright light therapy. Summary There are many environmental and genetic factors that can predispose an individual to circadian rhythm disorders. Delayed sleep phase disorder has detrimental effects on overall health, cognition, and behavior. It is important to screen for this disorder in routine pediatric clinic visits. The goal of early intervention is to prevent health and behavioral complications and treat adolescents using a multimodal approach, especially those with affective/neurodevelopmental conditions, who are prone to having delayed sleep wake phase disorder.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most frequent sleep disorder. It is a symptom, and is defined as “chronic inability to obtain the amount of sleep needed for optimal functioning and well-being”. Untreated insomnia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Thorough assessment of insomnia is essential in choosing the most appropriate strategy for management. If a cause of insomnia is identified, initial treatment should be directed at specific factor. Since insomnia is a chronic condition, long-term and safe treatments are warranted. Non-pharmacologic options have been available for decades, but lack of physician awareness and training, difficulty in obtaining reimbursements and questions about efficacy have limited their use. These therapies offer the greatest potential for long term gains in preventing recurrence of insomnia. Pharmacological options are most useful for acute insomnia. They are commonly used but long term use of hypnotics can become complicated by drug tolerance, dependence or rebound insomnia. Non-pharmacological interventions produce reliable and durable clinical benefits in the treatment of primary insomnia, insomnia associated with medical or psychiatric conditions and insomnia in elders. Additional research is still needed to develop and validate treatment algorithms that would optimize outcomes and reduce morbidity. Author concludes that non-pharmacological therapies should always be a component in management of Insomnia. Method: Pubmed.gov was searched by using pre-determined key word. Objectives: To provide an update of the evidence regarding the efficacy, effectiveness, durability and generalizability of psychological and behavioural interventions for persistent insomnia.",

Severity is subject to individual variation in susceptibility (morning/evening typology, age,...) and environmental factors (direction of travel, number of time zones crossed, psychosocial environment...). Many measures used to prevent or reduce jet lag are inappropriate or ineffective and some may even be dangerous, such as use of melatonin. One of the most reliable preventive techniques consists of reinforcing social synchronizers by maintaining exposure to sunlight and social activity.

The neurologic disturbances, often known as the Bing-Neel syndrome, include headache, dizziness, true vertigo, deafness, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia, paresthesias, and postural hypotension. Less often, congestive heart failure or renal impairment is seen. The main cause of the hyperviscosity syndrome is increased viscosity of the serum (as in macroglobulinemia or myeloma), although increased numbers of cells (polycythemia or leukemia) or increased resistance of cells",

      "abstract": "Back pain in the working age population can coincide with work-related activities and may lead to temporary or permanent work disability in the case of functional impairment that interacts with workplace demands. This can lead to economic if not existential problems for the affected individual. Although neurogenic or inflammatory back pain may be the cause, the big majority of all cases is caused by \"common\" low back pain with or without irradiating pain, the main problem being frequent recurrencies of acute pain episodes (periodic or relapsing course). After early exclusion of specific causes (i. e. \"red flags\": usually identified through history and simple laboratory findings!) repetitive examinations should be avoided. Structural changes and physical job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistent impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). Longtime workplace absence has important individual and socioeconomic consequences. The risk for chronification can be estimated through evaluation of \"yellow flags\" and observation of characteristics of the course in the individual case. An early return to work and to activities of daily life is urgent. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation or social and occupational reintegration should be organised.Rückenschmerzen im Erwerbstätigenalter zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie einerseits im Zusammenhang mit Arbeitstätigkeiten auftreten können, andererseits im Falle der Beeinträchtigung von Körperfunktionen mit den Arbeitsaufgaben interagieren können und so zur vorübergehenden oder andauernden Beeinträchtigung der Arbeitsfähigkeit führen können. Dies kann ökonomische, unter Umständen auch existentielle Probleme zur Folge haben. Obwohl auch neurogene und entzündliche Ursachen in Frage kommen, stellen die „banalen“ Rückenschmerzen mit und ohne Ausstrahlung die überwiegende Mehrzahl der Fälle dar. Ein Hauptproblem stellt sich aufgrund der hohen Rezidivneigung („periodischer Verlauf“). Nach frühzeitigem Ausschluss spezifischer Ursachen („rote Flaggen“: Anamnese und einfaches Labor meist ausreichend!) sind wiederholte Abklärung zu vermeiden. Strukturelle Veränderungen und physische Arbeitsbelastungen als Ursachen dürfen nicht überbewertet werden. Dagegen spielt in der Frühphase eine geeignete Information und Medikation, bei anhaltender Funktionsstörung eine aktive Behandlung (Verläufe über 3 Wochen oder Rezidive) im Vordergrund. Langzeitverläufe haben erhebliche individuelle und sozioökonomische Konsequenzen. Das Chronifizierungsrisiko kann mittels „gelber Flaggen“ und Verlaufscharakteristika erkannt werden. Eine möglichst rasche Rückkehr zu Alltagsaktivitäten ist vordringlich. Bei Risiko für chronische Verläufe und/oder Eingliederungsproblemen sind eine interdisziplinäre arbeitsbezogene Rehabilitation oder sozialberufliche Eingliederung zu forcieren.",

      "title": "Sleep Movements and Respiratory Coupling as a Biobehavioral Marker for Early Alzheimer’s Disease in Independently Dwelling Adults",
      "abstract": "Abstract INTRODUCTION: Sleep disorder is often the first symptom of age-related cognitive decline in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), or early Alzheimer’s disease. Patient or family sleep complaints in primary care do not reliably lead to screening for sleep or cognitive loss. In this study, poor sleep and arousability were examined using movement arousals, a novel biobehavioral marker of cumulative sleep loss, identified by periodic (circa 4 min) sleep movements (SM). We report that SM events trigger respiratory upregulation (RR) in healthy, but not in MCI-related, sleep. Time latency (TL) between SM-RR events is proposed as a marker of sleep loss and potentially of neurodegeneration associated with cognitive loss in MCI. METHOD . Community-dwelling older adults (N=95; 62-90 years) were tested in the home bed for two days on an “under the sheets” mattress overlay with high sensitivity for respiration and all movement, including micro-movements of SM. Wrist actigraphy (7 days) and standard sleep self-reports were collected as well. A suite of neurocognitive testing identified three groups: Normal Cognition (NC; n=45); clinic diagnosed MCI (MCI-DX; n= 17); and MCI-Consensus determined by an expert panel (MCI-CON; n=33 consensus or pre-clinical MCI) groups. RESULTS: In adjusted cohort analyses, sleep fragmentation (SF) and WASO predicted poorer memory performance selectively. Actigraphy revealed greater sleep latency (SL; p&lt;.008), sleep duration (p&lt;.01) and SF (p=.008) in MCI-DX compared to NC groups. Longer SL and poor sleep were associated with depression which was more prevalent in both MCI groups than NC. Neural Networks AI methods were applied to discriminate MCI and NC cases using the TL metric between SM-RR coupling events. ROC diagnostics were applied which identified MCI vs. NC cases with 87% sensitivity; 89% specificity; and 88% positive predictive value. DISCUSSION: MCI cognitive phenotype was detected with a novel sleep biomarker TL, associated with the tight gap between SM-RR coupling, which is proposed as a corollary of sleep quality/loss that affects the autonomic regulation of respiration during sleep. Movement arousals are less effective in initiating respiratory upregulation in MCI which suggests a potential mechanism for neurodegenerative changes and cognitive loss in early MCI.",

Insomnia in older adults with major depressive disorders includes early bedtime, but having trouble falling asleep, waking up at the middle of the night and having difficulty maintaining sleep, and waking up too early in the morning, but not feeling refresh. These symptoms can have impact on older adults such as interfere with daily life during the daytime, cause suffering, leading to severity and recurrent of depressive disorder. Related theories include Spielman’s 3 P model, a vicious cycle of insomnia model, and an integrative model. These theories explain causes and related factors, insomnia management, and consequences of individual with insomnia, as well as the development of the therapeutic guideline for insomnia in older adults with major depressive disorder focusing on restructuring cognition, belief, and behaviors about sleep.

Physiologic sleep is simply a period of resting for all our organs, their functions being markedly lowered, central control diminished, and changes of reconstruction occurring in our nervous equilibrium. The nervous patient sleeps badly, but the nature of the insomnia varies in many ways. Some go to sleep the moment they lie down, only to awake an hour or two later, to toss throughout the night, and possibly to doze off at the hour when they should awake. Others sleep well till the first peep of day, rising ill-humored and cross, having lost two of their nine hours' sleep. Some patients apparently never sleep and remain calm and comfortable the entire night, get very restless and provoked, get up and walk around",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Because hot flashes can occur during the night, their presence has been frequently associated with insomnia in women with symptoms of menopause. However, many factors other than hot flashes or menopause can be responsible for insomnia, and several factors associated with insomnia in the general population are also commonly observed in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women who have hot flashes. <h3>Methods</h3> A random sample of 3243 subjects (aged ≥18 years) representative of the California population was interviewed by telephone. Included were 982 women aged 35 to 65 years. Women were divided into 3 groups according to menopausal status: premenopause (57.2%), perimenopause (22.3%), and postmenopause (20.5%). Hot flashes were counted if they were present for at least 3 days per week during the last month and were classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to their effect on daily functioning. Chronic insomnia was defined as global sleep dissatisfaction, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or nonrestorative sleep, for at least 6 months. Diagnoses of insomnia were assessed according to the<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</i>, classification. <h3>Results</h3> Prevalence of hot flashes was 12.5% in premenopause, 79.0% in perimenopause, and 39.3% in postmenopause. Prevalence of chronic insomnia was reported as 36.5% in premenopause, 56.6% in perimenopause, and 50.7% in postmenopause (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Prevalence of symptoms of chronic insomnia increased with the severity of hot flashes, reaching more than 80% in perimenopausal women and postmenopausal women who had severe hot flashes. In multivariate analyses, severe hot flashes were significantly associated with symptoms and a diagnosis of chronic insomnia. Poor health, chronic pain, and sleep apnea were other significant factors associated with chronic insomnia. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Severe hot flashes are strongly associated with chronic insomnia in midlife women. The presence of hot flashes should be systematically investigated in women with insomnia. Treating hot flashes could improve sleep quality and minimize the deleterious consequences of chronic insomnia.",

SI, the cognitive and behavioral correlate of the transition from sleep to wakefulness, has been incorporated in several models of sleep and vigilance regulation. Monitoring of several physiological parameters during the awakening period clearly indicate that this transition process is very slow. On the cognitive and behavioral side, SI has relevant operational implications. SI is one of the most serious contraindications to the use of napping during quasi-continuous operations if the individual may be required to perform complex tasks immediately after sudden awakening at unpredictable times. The studies on SI modulating factors showed that SI is strongly affected by slow wave sleep amount and sleep depth, while the outcomes concerning the modulation of SI by circadian factors are not consistent. Cognitive tasks involving high attentional load seem to be much more affected by SI than simple motor ones, performance accuracy being more impaired than speed. Finally, some possible countermeasures against the detrimental effects of SI to be applied in operational settings have been provided.",

      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

      "abstract": "Sudden, unexpected deaths are a large and important group of deaths in the post-neonatal infant age group (1 month to 1 year). These deaths require a consistent high standard of investigation, which goes well beyond anatomic dissection and microscopic examination of tissue samples from a few major organs. Among the deaths presenting to the pathologist as sudden and unexpected will be those that are fully explained by a recognized disease process (see Chapter 12), some that are non-natural, some explained by minor or long-standing disease and others that occur in the absence of any pathological abnormality. Cases in the last three groups are often problematic and require the fullest, multidisciplinary investigation.",

Forty-three adult DM1 patients underwent 2 sequential polysomnographic sessions and a neuropsychological test battery (intellectual functioning, attention, language, memory, and executive functions). Lower scores in attention, vigilance, and executive functioning tests were associated with higher number of apneic/hypopneic episodes per hour of sleep and longer total sleep time at an oxyhemoglobin saturation of less than 90%.

In the healthcare field, sufficient sleep is imperative to ensure optimal patient care. Sleep deprivation can result in greater procedural errors, which places the clients at risk. Insufficient sleep negatively affects the nervous system, resulting in poor brain function. Because of the cognitive decline that is associated with sleep deprivation, academic performance is often decreased. In order to combat the phenomenon of sleep deprivation, positive lifestyle behaviors and sleep hygiene should be maintained. For students, academic and financial demands can contribute to physiological stress, which may cause impaired sleep quality. In particular, poor sleep quality, insomnia, and daytime sleepiness are reportedly prevalent in college students. Therefore, it is crucial that the effects of sleep deprivation in university students be further studied and interventions to alleviate the problem be explored.",

      "abstract": "Children born very preterm are at a greater risk of abnormal visual and neurological development when compared to children born at full term. Preterm birth is associated with retinopathy of prematurity (a proliferative retinal vascular disease) and can also affect the development of brain structures associated with post‐retinal processing of visual information. Visual deficits common in children born preterm, such as reduced visual acuity, strabismus, abnormal stereopsis and refractive error, are likely to be detected through childhood vision screening programs, ophthalmological follow‐up or optometric care. However, routine screening may not detect other vision problems, such as reduced visual fields, impaired contrast sensitivity and deficits in cortical visual processing, that may occur in children born preterm. For example, visual functions associated with the dorsal visual processing stream, such as global motion perception and visuomotor integration, may be impaired by preterm birth. These impairments can continue into adolescence and adulthood and may contribute to the difficulties in learning (particularly reading and mathematics), attention, behaviour and cognition that some children born preterm experience. Improvements in understanding the mechanisms by which preterm birth affects vision will inform future screening and interventions for children born preterm.",

Stress in children is emotional and is characterized by an increase in the thymus, as well as an increase in the level of corticosteroids in the blood, as a reflection of the innate immune-lymphoid defense of the child, which occurs in the process of the childbirth stress of mother. Other indicators of neurohormonal protection (adrenal glands, spleen, eosinopenia, hyperglycemia) are typical but less pronounced than in adults due to functional immaturity of systems and organs. The shift in the balance of the prooxidant-antioxidant system is not marked. In addition, \" child \" stress is manifested by deficiency of magnesium ( Mg 2+ ), a violation of the acid balance and immune deficiency. The above data serve as the basis for the proof of the need of involving in everyday complex therapy of any disease, depending on the indications, along with formulary preparations in children's doses of herbal sedatives (Valeriana officinalis, Cardamine pratensis), psycho-responsive tranquilizers and even neuroleptics, magnesium preparations, Echinacea in combination with Zinc and vitamin C.

      "title": "Neuroleptics and operant behavior: The anhedonia hypothesis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neuroleptic drugs disrupt the learning and performance of operant habits motivated by a variety of positive reinforcers, including food, water, brain stimulation, intravenous opiates, stimulants, and barbiturates. This disruption has been demonstrated in several kinds of experiments with doses that do not significantly limit normal response capacity. With continuous reinforcement neuroleptics gradually cause responding to cease, as in extinction or satiation. This pattern is not due to satiation, however, because it also occurs with nonsatiating reinforcement (such as saccharin or brain stimulation). Repeated tests with neuroleptics result in earlier and earlier response cessation reminiscent of the kind of decreased resistance to extinction caused by repeated tests without the expected reward. Indeed, withholding reward can have the same effect on responding under later neuroleptic treatment as prior experience with neuroleptics themselves; this suggests that there is a transfer of learning (really unlearning) from nonreward to neuroleptic conditions. These tests under continuous reinforcement schedules suggest that neuroleptics blunt the ability of reinforcers to sustain responding at doses which largely spare the ability of the animal to initiate responding. Animals trained under partial reinforcement, however, do not respond as well during neuroleptic testing as animals trained under continuous reinforcement. Thus, neuroleptics can also impair responding (though not response capacity ) that is normally sustained by environmental stimuli (and associated expectancies) in the absence of the primary reinforcer. Neuroleptics also blunt the euphoric impact of amphetamine in humans. These data suggest that the most subtle and interesting effect of neuroleptics is a selective attenuation of motivational arousal which is (a) critical for goal-directed behavior, (b) normally induced by reinforcers and associated environmental stimuli, and (c) normally accompanied by the subjective experience of pleasure. Because these drugs are used to treat schizophrenia and because they cause parkinsonian-like side effects, this action has implications for a better understanding of human pathology as well as normal motivational processes.",

This is the first report of somnambulistic sleepeating in which polysomnographic studies were performed to document the sleep-related nature of the nocturnal eating. During all-night sleep studies, three patients complaining of eating during sleep had episodic behavior in non-REM sleep, consistent with a somnambulistic etiology. In all three patients, a conscious preoccupation with food was present and two patients showed a high percentage of slow-wave sleep. These findings suggest a concurrence of organogenic and psychogenic factors, that has been postulated previously to underlie somnambulism in adults.",

      "title": "Tolerance and withdrawal symptoms may not be helpful to enhance understanding of behavioural addictions",
      "abstract": "The importance attached to tolerance and withdrawal symptoms in the conceptualization of addiction reflects the prominence of theories that posit neuroadaptation to the presence of a drug [1], and suggest that drug use persists because of negative reinforcement, i.e. as an effort to avoid the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms [2]. Given that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms do not always occur in addiction, they have not been included in the recent general definitions of addiction [3–5]. However, these phenomena are often incorporated into the conceptualization of behavioural addictions. For example, one model [6] postulates that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms are mandatory for any behaviour to be considered addictive. In behavioural addictions, tolerance is usually defined in a way that superficially resembles its counterpart in substance addictions, i.e. dose escalation to achieve the same initial effect. Thus, tolerance is portrayed as an increase in various aspects of the activity (frequency, intensity, duration, time spent, money spent) to achieve the desired effect, satisfaction or excitement. Occasionally, it is described as a need for the latest or more powerful equipment (e.g. mobile phones, computers, software) to produce the desired effect or excitement [7,8]. The diagnostic criteria for internet gaming disorder [9] do not state the purpose of an increase in activity engagement, implying that any such increase denotes tolerance. Nevertheless, increased activity engagement and a need for better equipment in behavioural addictions do not necessarily reflect tolerance [10,11], which underscores the importance of assessing the contextual aspects of these phenomena. Withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions have usually been described as emotional states (irritability, restlessness, anger, moodiness, sadness, guilt, anxiety, feeling tense) that occur when activity engagement is thwarted. In internet gaming disorder, withdrawal symptoms can be easily mistaken for reactions to an externally imposed gaming deprivation or for craving for gaming [12]. There have been no reports of severe physical withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions [13], and a few studies reporting physical withdrawal symptoms in pathological gambling [14,15] had significant methodological shortcomings. Withdrawal states occurring upon abrupt drug cessation comprise both physical and emotional symptoms, with the latter hypothesized to contribute more to the motivation to continue using drugs because of the short-lasting effects of the former [2]. In pathological gambling, however, emotional withdrawal symptoms, as well as tolerance, were not found to play an important role in maintaining this behavioural addiction [16]. ‘Borrowing’ tolerance and withdrawal from substance addictions might have been driven by a need to ‘legitimize’ behavioural addictions. This was unnecessary, because these phenomena and theories suggesting that they are important for addiction have not been able to account fully for either type of addiction [5]. The alternative is to conceptualize behavioural addictions via specific factors that explain more clearly attachment to the particular activity [17] and maintenance of addictive behaviour. In pathological gambling, these factors were identified as the negative feelings associated with gambling losses, shortage of money and the need to be secretive about gambling [16]. The task is to ascertain factors that provide an adequate account for each behavioural addiction. None.",

However, in some cases, the onset of seizures at birth or in the first months of life have a dramatic evolution with severe cerebral impairment. Seizure disorders starting in early life include the \"epileptic encephalopathies\", a group of conditions characterized by drug resistant seizures, delayed developmental skills, and intellective disability. This group of disorders includes early infantile epileptic encephalopathy also known as Ohtahara syndrome, early myoclonic encephalopathy, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, infantile spasms syndrome (also known as West syndrome), severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (also known as Dravet syndrome) and, myoclonic encephalopathies in non-progressive disorder. Here we report on seizures manifesting in the first year of life including the neonatal period. Conditions with a benign course, and those with severe evolution are presented. At this early age, clinical identification of seizures, distinction of each of these disorders, type of treatment and prognosis is particularly challenging. The aim of this report is to present the clinical manifestations of each of these disorders and provide an updated review of the conditions associated with seizures in the first year of life.",

      "title": "Recommendation for a definition of acute symptomatic seizure",
      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

A chronic illness has a lengthy duration, uncertain outcome, and unpredictable episodes, often with intrusive symptoms and intermittent or progressive disability. Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

Each of these states is composed of a number of physiologic variables generated in a variety of neural structures. The predictable oscillations of these states are driven by presumed neural pacemakers which are entrained to the 24 h geophysical environment by the light/dark cycle. Experiments in nature have indicated that wake/sleep rhythm perturbations may occur either involving desynchronization of the basic 24 h wake/sleep cycle within the geophysical 24 h cycle (circadian rhythm disturbances) or involving the rapid oscillation or incomplete declaration of state (such as narcolepsy). The use of phase spaces to describe states of being may be of interest in the description of state determination in both illness and health. Some fascinating clinical and experimental phenomena may represent bifurcations in the sleep/wake control system.",

      "abstract": "One cannot but be struck with the fact that in many (if not in most) attacks of acute insanity the patient, on recovery, has no recollection of the incidents of the illness. She may have answered our questions in a way showing that at the time there was not only a consciousness of a certain kind present, but also the capacity for understanding and replying in accordance with her ideas (however unfounded they may, in fact, be), and yet on recovery, or even in a temporary lucid interval, all remembrance of the disordered state has passed away, and that, too, beyond the capacity of recall—nothing but a misty, hazy remembrance of some condition which has been passed through remains, just as one finds it impossible to re-instate the details of a dream, the reality of which was at the time vivid in consciousness. We have here to deal with a dual consciousness, a knowledge of states apparently incompatible with, and distinct from, each other. We are all familiar with states of acute mental disturbance where there is difficulty in making the patient understand what we are saying—not necessarily difficult or involved questions, but simple queries relating to what we think are matters in the patient‘s consciousness, such as it is. Here it is doubtful if the patients really understand what we are saying, though there is no doubt about their hearing the question, e.g. , they may hear the question but the reply will be merely the reiteration of some particular delusion which has no connection with the question, or there need not be any reply at all, as if we were addressing them in a foreign language which they did not understand, or as if what is said to them has a different meaning from what is intended.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is frequently acquainting as an abnormal accumulation of body fat to the degree that may cause serious health consequences. ( Yanovski et al. , 2014). One of the most common complication of obesity is obstructive sleep apnea(OSA). Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a widespread complaint that is closely associated with global obesity epidemics, and it is described as frequent complete or partial flop of the upper airway during sleep leading to gaseous exchange impairment and disturbance of sleep. It is the commonest category of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in the world as reported in different epidemiological studies. (McNicholas et al ., 2007). Central sleep apnea : is described  as decreased respiratory effort leading to decrease or absence of ventilation .While in mixed apnea it is categorized by starting centrally and ending with obstructive events.In obstructive sleep apnea: the effort of  respiration is preserved but ventilation decrement  or absence due to partial or total obstruction in the upper airway; apnea is well-defined as the total airflow cessation lasting 10 sec. or more , There are three types of apneas :obstructive, central and mixed . A hypopnea: is defined as a reduction in airflow (30-50%) that is followed by an arousal from sleep or a decrease in oxyhaemoglobin saturation (3-4%)( The Report of an American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force, 1999 and Kushida et al .,2005). The severity of sleep apnea is evaluated with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which is the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. According to the American Academy of sleep Medicine recommendations , OSA is defined with AHI>5., and it is classified as mild OSA with AHI of 5 to 15;moderate OSA with AHI of 16 to 30;and severe OSA with AHI > 30.(The Report of an American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force, 1999). The Apnea–Hypopnea Index or Apnoea–Hypopnoea Index (AHI) is an index used to determine sleep apnea severity. It is characterized by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. The apneas (pauses in breathing) must last for at least 10 seconds and associated with a decrease in blood oxygenation. Combining AHI and oxygen desaturation measurement gives a complete sleep apnea severity score that assesses the number of sleep disruptions and degree of oxygen desaturation.               (Ruehland et al .,2009 ). The AHI is calculated by dividing the number of apnea events by the number of hours of sleep. AHI values are categorized as Normal: 0-4;Mild Sleep Apnea: 5-14;Moderate Sleep Apnea: 15-29; Severe Sleep Apnea: 30 or more.(Ruehland et al ., 2009 ).",

Typically, a patient is admitted to the hospital in a confused or frightened state. Memory for the past has been lost, especially personal, autobiographical memory. Often, the patient cannot produce his or her own name. Yet, the ability to learn new material is almost always intact. After the disorder clears, usually within a week, the lost memories return except for the events of the day or two just prior to hospital admission.

      "title": "Hiccups as a myocardial ischemia symptom",
      "abstract": "A hiccup is involuntary, paroxysmal inspiratory movements of the chest wall associated with diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscle contractions, with the synchronized closure of glottis. The mechanism underlying this common primitive reflex plays an important role in protecting airways against esophageal aspiration. The hiccup reflex mechanism is based on the afferent pathway (vagus and phrenic nerve and sympathetic fibers innervating chest organs, the abdomen, the ear, the nose and the throat stimulation, and the stimulation of hiccup center in the central nervous system, mainly reflecting psychogenic or metabolic disorders) and the efferent pathway (phrenic nerves). An incidental hiccup is a common problem, usually resolves spontaneously and does not present a clinical issue. The clinical issue arises in the case of pathologic persistent hiccups or symptomatic secondary hiccups which may lead to significant fatigue, insomnia or depression. Generally, pathologic hiccups are associated with considerable discomfort concerning both the \"stigmatized\" person and his or her personal surroundings in which it evokes different emotions, from amusement through impatience to uneasiness and the suggestion of a medical visit as an expression of concern for a given person. The most common causes of pathologic symptomatic hiccups are nervous system diseases, either the central nervous system (proliferative, angiogenic, inflammatory disorders), or the peripheral nervous system: the irritation of the phrenic nerve (proliferative disorders, goitre) and the vagus nerve (otolaryngologic diseases, meningitis, esophageal, stomach and duodenal diseases, hepatitis, pancreatitis, enteritis). The vagus nerve irritation with subsequent hiccups may be caused by chest disorders (injury, surgery) and heart diseases (myocardial infarction). In the present paper we describe the case of a 62-year-old male with recurrent hiccups associated with exertion as a secondary symptom of myocardial ischemia.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in bereaved older people: a review of the literature",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are often seen in older people who have recently experienced the death of a loved one, such as a partner or spouse. Older family carers are particularly at risk of mood and sleep disturbances, not only after the death of the person they were caring for but also beforehand. Sleep disturbances can be treated with psychotropic medicines, but these are not adequate in older people because of the risk of falls, fractures and road accidents. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is a non-pharmacological intervention that has been found to be beneficial in bereaved older carers.This article offers a systematic review of the literature on sleep disturbances in bereaved older people. One of the main findings is that sleep disturbances may begin before the loved one's death, during the caregiving period. More research is needed on sleep disturbances in bereaved older people – notably in those aged ≥85 years, in partners or spouses from same-sex couples, into long-term symptoms post-bereavement, and into sleep interventions provided before the loved one's death.",

      "title": "Influences of Allergic Rhinitis on Sleep",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Allergic rhinitis is classically characterized by sneezing, pruritus, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. These symptoms can lead to impaired nocturnal sleep, and this impairment results in daytime fatigue and somnolence, reducing both learning and work efficiency and decreasing quality of life. STUDY DESIGN In addition, the mediators of AR, including histamine, leukotrienes, cytokines, and prostaglandins, may play a role in sleep regulation and, thus, may be directly involved in this impairment independent of nasal obstruction. Recumbency and/or diurnal variation augments turbinate swelling, causing nasal blockage during nocturnal sleep. Medications directed toward reversal of nasal congestion often concomitantly work through suppression of inflammatory mediators and constitute the primary therapy for sleep disturbance associated with allergic rhinitis. Some pharmaceutical interventions that reduce nasal congestion have adverse effects on sleep. Decongestants effectively reduce nasal congestion but frequently produce stimulatory effects and even insomnia. Antihistamines reduce sneezing and pruritus, but are less effective in relieving congestion. Earlier, “first‐generation” antihistamines are associated with significant sedation. They also have anticholinergic properties, which can cause dry mouth and make mouth breathing even more uncomfortable in the allergic individual with nasal obstruction. The absence of anticholinergic properties in second‐generation, largely nonsedating antihistamines limits their efficacy in rhinorrhea. Azelastine, a topical antihistamine, significantly reduces rhinorrhea and congestion and improves subjective sleep quality, but is also associated with increased sedation. Intranasal corticosteroids and oral leukotriene receptor antagonists effectively reduce rhinorrhea, congestion, and inflammatory mediators. CONCLUSIONS The efficacy of these medications at improving subjective sleep quality has been established through multiple randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trials.",

      "title": "Chronic Hiccups: An Underestimated Problem",
      "abstract": "Persistent singultus, hiccupping that lasts for longer than 48 hours, can have a tremendous impact on a patient’s quality of life. Although involved neurologic structures have been identified, the function of hiccups remains unclear—they have been controversially interpreted as a primitive reflex preventing extent swallowing of amniotic fluid in utero, an archaic gill ventilation pattern, or a fetus’ preparation for independent breathing. Persistent singultus often presents as a symptom for various diseases, most commonly illnesses of the central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract; they can also be evoked by a variety of pharmacological agents. It is often impossible to define a singular cause. A wide range of treatment attempts, pharmacological and nonpharmacological, have been concerted to this date; however, chlorpromazine remains the only Food and Drug Administration–approved drug in this context. Large-scale studies on efficacy and tolerance of other therapeutic strategies are lacking. Gabapentin, baclofen, and metoclopramide have been reported to accomplish promising results in reports on the therapy of persistent singultus; they may also be effective when given in combination with other drugs, eg, proton pump inhibitors, or as conjoined therapy. As another approach of note, acupuncture treatment was able to abolish hiccups in a number of studies. When managing hiccup patients within the clinical routine, it is of importance to conduct a comprehensive and effective diagnostic workup; a well-functioning interdisciplinary team is needed to address possible causes for the symptom. Persistent singultus is a medical problem not to be underestimated; more research on options for effective treatment would be greatly needed.",

      "abstract": "Social jetlag (SJ) occurs when sleep-timing irregularities from social or occupational demands conflict with endogenous sleep–wake rhythms. SJ is associated with evening chronotype and poor mental health, but mechanisms supporting this link remain unknown. Impaired ability to retrieve extinction memory is an emotion regulatory deficit observed in some psychiatric illnesses. Thus, SJ-dependent extinction memory deficits may provide a mechanism for poor mental health. To test this, healthy male college students completed 7–9 nights of actigraphy, sleep questionnaires, and a fear conditioning and extinction protocol. As expected, greater SJ, but not total sleep time discrepancy, was associated with poorer extinction memory. Unexpectedly, greater SJ was associated with a tendency toward morning rather than evening chronotype. These findings suggest that deficient extinction memory represents a potential mechanism linking SJ to psychopathology and that SJ is particularly problematic for college students with a greater tendency toward a morning chronotype.",

Patient with this insomnia has generally a strong fear and frustration about failing to control of sleep and a deep mistrust toward doctor.

Through these procedures, doctor should clarify causes of insomnia and explain them to patient in details and kindly. This process would be very helpful to restore the mistrustful relationship between patient and doctor and reduce patient's vague fear for insomnia. In treatment of complicated chronic insomnia, it is most important for patient to understand his problems and participate in the treatment schedule actively with assurance. Also doctor should encourage patient persistently not to be drop out. Most important factor for prognosis is patient's personality. Causes of complicated chronic insomnia are like these, overdose of hypnotics and sedatives, daily drinking alcohol with hypnotics, insomnia associated depression, delayed sleep phase syndrome, sleep state misperception, marked fear for insomnia, hyperarousal at bed, insomnia associated periodic leg movement and sleep apnea, chronic hypnotic insomnia, and immature personality.

Healthy sleep is a whole-body process impacted by circadian rhythm, daily activities, and emotional well-being, among others. When properly aligned, these work in concert to produce restorative and refreshing sleep. When not in balance, however, sleep disorders result. Yet too often, the approach to treatment of sleep disorders is compartmentalized, failing to recognize all of the complex interactions that are involved. This text offers a comprehensive approach to sleep and sleep disorders by delineating the many factors that interplay into healthy sleep. Health care providers can learn how to better manage their patients with sleep disorders by integrating complementary and conventional approaches. Using an evidence-based approach throughout, this book describes the basics of normal sleep then delves into the foundations of integrative sleep medicine, including the circadian rhythm, mind/body-sleep connection, light, dreaming, the gastrointestinal system, and botanicals/supplements. Specific sleep issues and disorders are then addressed from an integrative perspective, including insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, sleep related movement disorders, and parasomnias.",

[2]Also, types of abuse are related to specific psychiatric comorbidity.Sexual abuse is more associated with posttraumatic stress disorder than other kinds of abuse. [3,4]otional intelligence is the ability to recognize the meanings of emotions and their relationships and to use them as a basis for reasoning, problem-solving, and enhancing cognitive activities.Emotional intelligence is comprised of four skills: emotion regulation, emotion recognition in self and others (e.g.reading mind and alexithymia), understanding of emotion, and utilization of emotion to facilitate thinking. [5]Evidence in studies suggests that traumatic experience can rapidly alter brain activation associated with emotional intelligence such as emotion processing. [6]Children with early-life trauma exposure show altered connectivity in brain systems relevant for detecting and processing emotional information and early-life adversity is associated with reorganization of neural circuits in ways that enhance processing of salient emotional stimuli.Altered processing of emotional Objectives: The aim was to investigate the effects of child sexual abuse on emotional intelligence in children with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Also, there is no study assessing the effects of incest on emotional intelligence in children with PTSD after sexual abuse.The current study aimed to assess the effects of incest on emotional intelligence.Methods: This study included 30 female children with sexual abuse, 20 female traffic accident victims with PTSD, and 25 female healthy volunteers as controls.All participants in the study were assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the reading mind from eyes test (RMET) for children.Results: It was found that the TAS-20 total score was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls.Difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales scores were higher in the incest group.When the groups were compared regarding total DERS scores, it was found that it was found that the DERS total scale was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls while no difference was detected between the CSA victims without incest and the incest group.RMET score was significantly lower in the incest group than in the CSA victims without incest.Conclusion: Sexual abuse disrupts emotional processing in female children.It is important to consider the clinical features of emotion processing that could contribute to PTSD treatment in children with sexual abuse.",

Idiopathic RBD occurs in the absence of any neurological disease or other possible cause, is male-predominant and its clinical course is generally chronic progressive. Secondary RBD may be related to neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. Recent long-term prospective studies have shown that 30% to 65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disorder with the rate of emergence depending on the length of the follow-up period. RBD may therefore be one of the earliest signs of and/or a long-term predictor for neurodegenerative disorders. Because RBD antecedes the development of these disorders by several years or decades, its recognition may enable the delay or prevention of neurodegenerative disorders through the early application of neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapies in the future.",

It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "abstract": "In recent years there has been a striking increase in the number of transnational adoptions in our country, which follows the trend already observed in other developed European countries. Major contributing factors to this phenomenon have been the improvements in socioeconomic conditions in our country, the drop in the birth rate, with the corresponding decrease in the number of children available for adoption, and the disappearance of orphanages. This growing demand can be met by developing countries, in which the birth rate is still high and there are only limited chances of being able to maintain offspring. The children that are adopted come mainly from countries in Central and South America, Eastern Europe and Asia. Pathologies that can be expected in adopted children include general paediatric conditions, especially infections (which are often autochthonous ailments in their own country) and malnutrition, as well as neuropsychological and developmental disorders, such as psychomotor retardation, conduct and behavioural disorders, which sometimes stem from conflicts arising in the process of adaptation, communication problems, which occasionally reflect an autistic like disorder, and the problems deriving from the circumstances that condition the donation of the child for adoption (perinatal pathology, maternal drug addiction and withdrawal symptoms, maternal psychopathology.). The pathology, history and prognosis of the adopted child depend on several different factors that act in an accumulative fashion. The country of origin plays a decisive role in the type of pathology, according to the level of the health care system that exists there, the existence of adoption programmes that are regulated by law, etc. The child's age at adoption marks the difference in the optimisation of their development, if they have early access to a stable family unit. Having stayed in institutions and the length of time spent there is a risk factor for presenting a neuropsychological pathology. On many occasions the scarce information available about the child's medical history makes it more difficult to anticipate the appearance of certain problems. The existence of social risk factors in the biological families is a conditioning factor in increased morbidity. We describe a short series of adopted patients who were attended in our Neuropaediatric clinic, and we analyse the above mentioned conditioning variables and the most frequent pathologies.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

      "abstract": "Seizures and epilepsy commonly occur in patients with organ system failure, either as a consequence of trophic effects on cerebral function or of therapies used in such conditions. Acute organ failure results in an abrupt, but often reversible, lowering of seizure threshold, whereas chronic organ failure results in more pervasive and indolent cerebral compromise, often permanently altering both the seizure threshold and the physiologic responses to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Failure of an organ system is not typically a sudden, all-or-none phenomenon but occurs in stages with variable susceptibility to seizures as the condition worsens or remits. Although the principles of diagnosis and management of seizures in adult and pediatric patients with a specific organ dysfunction are similar, the underlying etiologies and influences of comorbid conditions differ between adults and children. Adult organ failure often involves multiple systems to different extents and is superimposed on other chronic diseases of adulthood. Pediatric organ failure is usually the result of inherited metabolic disorders, infections, and unique pediatric susceptibilities to metabolic effects of medications (Table 1).",

      "abstract": "REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) occurs in up to 90% of narcolepsy patients. REM behavior disorder (RBD), however, is reported to occur in only 12% to 36% of patients with narcolepsy. Use of RSWA has been proposed as an additional marker for narcolepsy diagnosis and as a tool to differentiate between narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. We describe a case of narcolepsy without cataplexy (N-C) with RSWA on polysomnogram (PSG), but no RBD on PSG or by history. A 26 year old female with history of depression, anxiety, and migraine headaches presented with excessive daytime sleepiness requiring daytime naps since childhood. She endorsed sleep paralysis but not hypnagogic hallucinations, dream enactment or cataplexy. Sleep disordered breathing or other abnormalities were absent on overnight PSG. RSWA was seen, however, video recording did not reveal dream enactment behavior. The subsequent multiple sleep latency test showed a mean sleep latency of 3 minutes over 5 naps and 2 sleep onset REM periods. REM related motor findings occur at a higher frequency in patients with narcolepsy than in the general population. Hypocretin deficiency is believed to be the major determinant of REM sleep motor dysregulation observed in narcolepsy. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (N+C) are more frequently involved than patients with N-C. RBD associated with narcolepsy differs from idiopathic RBD in that it has equal gender predominance, earlier age at onset, and is associated with less violent and less complex behaviors. Interestingly, RSWA may be absent in RBD with narcolepsy. In addition, RSWA in narcolepsy is frequent even in the absence of RBD. This highlights the need to develop diagnostic criteria for RBD specific to the context of narcolepsy. RSWA is seen in high frequency in narcolepsy and should be strongly considered as a secondary diagnostic criteria.",

      "title": "Models of Pediatric Epilepsies: Strategies and Opportunities",
      "abstract": "Pediatric epilepsies are among the most devastating of neurologic disorders. The developing brain is particularly susceptible to seizures, and seizure activity early in brain development can cause profound neurologic impairment, enhance subsequent seizure propensity during maturation and in adulthood, and lead to abnormalities in cognitive function (1). In infancy and childhood, two broad categories of epilepsy are of particular concern because of their intractability to treatment and association with cognitive decline: (a) The so-called “catastrophic” childhood epilepsies (including infantile spasms, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, and the progressive myoclonic epilepsies) are characterized by numerous etiologies, by age-specific developmental windows of seizure onset, by refractoriness to medical treatment, and by progressive cognitive deterioration (epileptic encephalopathy). Seizures associated with catastrophic epilepsy syndromes tend to have bilateral/generalized manifestations: (b) Refractory partial epilepsies are often associated with dysplastic brain lesions (i.e., tuberous sclerosis complex, TSC), or severe perinatally induced injuries (i.e., perinatal stroke or hypoxia); seizures of this type may be also seen with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, but this latter condition is more prevalent in late childhood and adolescence. Often an overlap exists between these two broad categories of medically intractable epilepsies; for example, TSC is commonly associated with generalized infantile spasms as well as with multifocal partial seizures. This overlap suggests that common features may exist in the pathogenesis of different epilepsy types during early brain development. Regardless of the epilepsy type, etiology, or syndrome, the mechanisms of epilepsies in infancy and early childhood likely differ significantly from those of epilepsies in older children and adults. These mechanistic differences have important implications for therapeutic strategy and therapeutic efficacy (2,3). The lack of appropriate animal models is a major impediment to a more complete understanding of pediatric epilepsy and to more effective treatments. Animal models serve numerous functions. They provide opportunities to investigate and elucidate basic mechanisms, to test and/or develop new antiepileptic medications (AEDs) and other therapeutic modalities, to devise new diagnostic approaches, and to study the neurologic consequences of seizures at various stages of brain development (4–7). Given the many (and often significant) differences between human and animal (i.e., rodent) brain structure and developmental profiles, no animal model is likely to reproduce faithfully every aspect of a human epilepsy syndrome. However, the insightful use of such models can play a pivotal role in generating hypotheses about the mechanisms, pathogenesis, and consequences of seizures in the developing brain, and for testing potential therapies. This report summarizes discussions held during a workshop on Models of Pediatric Epilepsies, held in Bethesda, MD, on May 13–14, 2004. The Workshop was sponsored by NINDS/NIH and supported by grants from the American Epilepsy Society and the International League Against Epilepsy. Whereas previous NIH workshops have examined general priorities for epilepsy research (8,9), the current Workshop focused explicitly on epilepsies in the developing brain. Invited participants included clinical pediatric epileptologists, basic epilepsy researchers, and developmental neurobiologists (Appendix A). The general goals of the Workshop are shown in Table 1. They arose from the following questions: Given the wide diversity of seizure types presenting at different developmental ages, certain clinical questions must be considered (i.e., what clinical problems are most pressing and what additional information is needed to guide model development? Are clinical disorders sufficiently well defined to provide guidance for the laboratory researcher attempting to model a human clinical condition? How do we deal with the observation that, in humans, numerous etiologies can cause the same epilepsy syndrome (and, in some cases, a given etiology will result in different seizure phenotypes)? What is presently known about existing models of catastrophic generalized epilepsy and intractable partial epilepsy? Why has it been so difficult to develop models of pediatric epilepsies? Challenges to development of animal models of pediatric epilepsy include the uncertainty of what constitutes analogous developmental ages in humans and experimental animals (especially rodents), vast interspecies differences in the rate and patterns of brain growth and neuronal maturation, and dissimilarities of seizure phenotypes and EEG manifestations seen across different species. A goal of the Workshop was to derive recommendations on the use of current (and future) animal models, including suggestions about the appropriateness of different species, genetic background, seizure etiologies, and other clinically relevant variables. How can we generate specific modeling targets, and what criteria can we use for “validating” the models? Although broad agreement was reached that catastrophic generalized epilepsies and intractable focal epilepsies are important targets for model development, many questions remained about how to prioritize these targets (pressing clinical need? highest likelihood of rapid returns? pathophysiologic relevance?). Given the complexity of the clinical conditions in question, what subset of experimentally approachable features should to be reproduced in useful models? What are the bases for accepting or rejecting these models as clinically relevant/useful? What conceptual and technologic advances would facilitate our attempts to understand developmental epilepsies? Technologic developments, development of modeling approaches at different levels (computer simulations, tissue-culture preparations, intact animals), and consideration of animals species not currently exploited for model development may be key directions for future progress. Finally, how can we establish networks of collaboration among laboratories involved in pediatric epilepsy research, and how can our limited resources be maximized? To facilitate model development, a variety of common strategies can and should be used. A more complete understanding of salient clinical features (e.g., epidemiology, etiology, pathology, and natural history of intractable developmental epilepsies) will undoubtedly facilitate the generation of models with features that are clinically relevant. Toward this goal, it is necessary to elucidate the developmental progression of key biomarkers (e.g., neurotransmitters, membrane ion channels, subcellular signaling cascades), behavioral phenotypes, and numerous other factors to understand their relations to age-specific epilepsies. Age-related differences in neuronal plasticity and glial function are emerging as key modulators of pediatric epilepsy. Other avenues of potential importance are just beginning to receive experimental attention, such as the role of stress in epileptogenesis, the effects of seizure-induced acute and chronic inflammation, and subtle circuit reorganization associated with neurogenesis, axonal sprouting, and molecular plasticity. In any model of epileptic encephalopathy, a concerted effort should be made to determine long-term consequences of the neurobiologic abnormalities, including behavioral changes, cognitive dysfunction, and seizure susceptibility. In generating models of pediatric epilepsies, it is important to remember that in some children with an epileptic encephalopathy, the seizures themselves may be less impairing to the child than the associated cognitive deficits. In other cases, the seizures may exacerbate the cognitive deficits. Further, the effects of anticonvulsant drugs and other treatments on parameters of brain development and cognition must be considered in parallel with their effects on seizures themselves. Model development should involve, as a key goal, efficient means for the testing new anticonvulsant/antiepileptic (and even antiepileptogenic) medications, as well as for evaluating novel therapies such as special diets targeted to seizure control (e.g., ketogenic diet, low-glycemic-index diet), a variety of implantable stimulation devices (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation), and novel drug-delivery systems. These models should also allow us to test the potentially beneficial effects of environmental enrichments that may reduce the morbidity of epilepsy in children. The models should be useful for investigating if/how treatments might slow (or halt) the progression of epilepsy (antiepileptogenesis). The Workshop's recommendations with respect to general strategies for model development are shown in Table 2. Workshop participants defined an ideal model as one in which one or more aspects of human pediatric epilepsy could be studied, recognizing that inherent species differences preclude exact replication. To model a given type of pediatric epilepsy accurately, the investigator must be aware of the diversity of seizure manifestations and etiologies associated with the targeted human epilepsy syndrome. For example, what appear to be similar lesions may cause severe epilepsy in one patient and minor or no dysfunction in another. Seizures differ according to etiology, age at onset, genetic predisposition, EEG findings, treatment responsiveness, natural history, and numerous other factors. In the complex task of designing a clinically relevant animal model, two complementary approaches should be considered. An “intuitive” or “face-value” model attempts to replicate the human disease as closely as possible; this approach is likely to be high risk and may not readily yield insights into mechanism. Alternatively, a “reductionist” model isolates specific components of the pathophysiology and allows the investigator to study underlying mechanism; it may, however, provide limited data about clinically relevant behaviors and/or responses to treatment. As a first step in establishing criteria for an “ideal” model, the definition of epilepsy as unprovoked, recurrent seizures must be considered. Seizures induced immediately by chemical agents and electrical stimulation can yield important, age-specific mechanistic information. However, for a model to be truly “epileptic,” seizures should occur spontaneously, without provocation, during an appropriate age window. Worthy of consideration, however, are models in which only EEG abnormalities are apparent, or in which enhanced seizure-propensity occurs (which is manifest when the animal is challenged in some way). Second, the investigator should recognize that human epilepsy syndromes often involve multiple etiologies. An ideal animal model might incorporate similar etiologies, such as an acquired insult (trauma, fever) or a genetic mutation. In reality, it is unlikely that the most popular current methods used to induce seizures in animal models (e.g., kainic acid, pilocarpine, fever, hypoxia/ischemia) are “equivalent” to the factors that lead to human epilepsies. This lack of generalizability may affect our ability to “validate” a given model. However, because these factors can be experimentally manipulated, they give the investigator an opportunity to consider how such insults (or genetic factors) interact. Multiple insults, occurring at different times of development, may reflect a clinically realistic approach to generation of pediatric epilepsies. A third criterion for an ideal animal model is that the seizure phenotype of the model should resemble the phenotype of the seizure of interest in the humans, with site-specific behavioral manifestations. Whereas the focus of many epilepsy models has been on the hippocampus and neocortex, the brainstem and other brain regions should be considered, especially because many subcortically mediated behaviors may be critical for seizure manifestations in young rodents. Realistically, it is unlikely that rodent seizures, and particularly seizures in young rat or mouse pups, will fulfill this phenotypic ideal. It is our challenge to determine what seizure phenomena in rodents—behavioral and/or electrical—correspond to salient seizure phenomena in human infants and babies. Fourth, although species differences probably preclude an exact correlation between human and animal, EEG abnormalities should be present in the animal model; preferably, those EEG abnormalities should have common features with the human condition. For example, in the case of modeling infantile spasms (see later), specific interictal versus ictal EEG patterns (e.g., hypsarrhythmia vs. electrodecremental responses) would ideally be present in the animal model. Fifth, an ideal model would include responsiveness to syndrome-specific antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or other treatment modalities, as seen in the human disorder. Finally, the cognitive and behavioral consequences of seizures in an animal model should resemble those in the human syndrome. Long-standing uncertainty has existed as to whether seizures themselves cause brain damage and resultant neurologic/cognitive dysfunction, or whether underlying neurologic impairment leads to both seizures and cognitive consequences. Animal models maybe useful in sorting out these variables, because the animal-model approach offers the researcher a “normal” control brain as a starting point. Given that catastrophic epilepsies in the immature brain are relatively rare, one might argue that modeling resources could be better used to study more common—and easier-to-target—pediatric epilepsies. The Workshop participants were unanimous, however, in supporting the importance of developing a system in which we can more effectively study and treat catastrophic syndromes. Workshop participants discussed infantile spasms as an example of catastrophic generalized epilepsy, as this syndrome carries a particularly poor prognosis, and an optimal therapy does not exist (10). Infantile spasms is an age-specific epileptic encephalopathy, occurring primarily in the 4- to 10-month range. West syndrome consists of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia (on interictal EEG), and mental retardation. It may appear several months after virtually any insult to the developing brain, such as infection, cerebral dysgenesis, hemorrhage, or hypoxia–ischemia. Animal models of the human infantile spasms phenotype have been especially difficult to generate, perhaps because of our lack of understanding of the underlying causes and mechanisms. None of the recent attempts to model infantile spasms in animals has produced results that exactly “fit” the human syndrome (11). In addressing the question of what features would be important to reproduce in the animal, there was general agreement about the key characteristic factors required in an ideal model (Table 3), but considerable disagreement among Workshop participants about how to prioritize these targets. Certainly, it would be desirable to have seizures that resemble the spasms seen in infants, with sudden extension or flexion of the body, often occurring in clusters during sleep–wake transitions. Myoclonic seizures would be an alternative phenotypic target. Furthermore, an interictal EEG showing hypsarrhythmia, and an ictal electrodecrement EEG, would lend validity to the model. It was noted, however, that if hypsarrhythmia were defined to include the presence of multifocal, high-amplitude discharges, that pattern may be extremely difficult to document in a rat or mouse pup (where placement of multiple electrodes over the brain is limited by size and fragility). Therefore modeling of hypsarrhythmia may be restricted to larger animal models until technologic advances permit the development of “micro” electrode assemblies. An animal model of this disorder should also mimic cognitive stagnation or decline. Finally, the often-dramatic response in humans to administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) [or of vigabatrin (VGB) in a subpopulation], with resolution of both spasms and EEG abnormalities, would add credibility to a model. Various attempts to model infantile spasms in animals were discussed. One model involves intraventricular administration of picomolar amounts of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to neonatal rats (12), an interesting approach, given the peculiar response of infantile spasms to ACTH. Further, the perinatal stress caused by etiologies associated with infantile spasms has led to the hypothesis that stress may increase endogenous CRH levels in seizure-prone areas of the developing brain, leading to neuronal damage, axonal reorganization, long-term cognitive deficits, and possibly age-related seizures such as infantile spasms (13). The CRH-induced seizure phenotype (primarily “limbic”) and EEG abnormalities do not mimic features of infantile spasms. However, CRH-treated rats do display cognitive deficiencies. Although CRH-induced seizures are not responsive to ACTH, ACTH does reduce CRH gene expression in certain neuronal populations (14). Another attempt to model infantile spasms involves intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) in infant rats (15,16). This agent causes a clinical seizure described as emprosthotonus, consisting of whole-body tonic flexion with back-arching. Although EEG findings are variable, these seizures are often accompanied by a decrement of the EEG amplitude, resembling the electrodecremental response in the human EEG. However, interictal hypsarrhythmia is lacking, no spontaneous seizures have been recorded, and the seizures are not responsive to ACTH. Lennox–Gastaut syndrome is another age-specific human epileptic encephalopathy, consisting of intractable seizures of multiple types plus mental retardation. Lennox–Gastaut syndrome has also been resistant to animal modeling. The infantile spasms of West syndrome often evolve, as the infant develops, into the various seizure types associated with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. Investigators have focused on mimicking a single seizure type frequently seen in Lennox–Gastaut syndrome: atypical absence seizures (AASs) (17). Rats treated with an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis develop life-long recurrent episodes of bilateral synchronous slow spike–wave discharges (emanating from both hippocampi), characteristic of AAS; these discharges are associated with ictal clinical manifestations of staring and facial myoclonus. Later in life, these rats exhibit deficits in long-term potentiation and spatial learning and memory (18). These modeling attempts illustrate the difficulties that arise when trying to model a seizure type—and an epilepsy syndrome—as complex as infantile spasms and West syndrome. Clearly, one of the most difficult issues is the semiology of the seizures themselves. Infant rats (and mice) exhibit a variety of jerky movements and behaviors, especially during sleep (19), that can sometimes be confused with pathologic spasms. The differential occurrence of these spasm-like movements during wakefulness or sleep adds to the difficulty of the modeling challenge. Thus to be considered epileptic, any paroxysmal behaviors resembling spasms or myoclonus should be associated with an EEG seizure discharge. Ideally, a model of these pediatric epilepsy syndromes in mouse or rat would arise from some understanding of the pathophysiology underlying the disorder, an insight not yet achieved at the clinical level. The concept of “multiple hit” models of pediatric epilepsies was discussed in relation to model development for generalized catastrophic disorders. In some syndromes, epilepsy might occur as a consequence of two (or more) independent, but interdependent brain insults. An “acquired” insult (such as head trauma or hypoxia) may be superimposed on a background of genetic mutation; for example, mutation of the LIS1 gene (as seen in Miller–Dieker syndrome) is associated with neurodevelopmental pathology (20) and predisposes to infantile spasms. Such genetic-acquired two-hit models require further exploration. Whereas infantile spasms represents a generalized catastrophic epilepsy of childhood, other epilepsies appear to result from focal brain abnormalities and are reflected in partial seizures (for example, traumatic brain injury and developmental migration disorders that lead to cortical dysplastic lesions) (21,22). Discussion at the Workshop focused on TSC, a multisystem disorder often associated with refractory seizures (23); thus TSC can be considered an example of an intractable partial epilepsy of childhood. Epilepsy develops in >90% of children with TSC, and the severity of neurologic impairment in TSC is correlated with early onset of seizures (24). Because of the occurrence of multiple cortical tubers in a given patient, children may have one or several seizure foci that individually or together cause multifocal partial seizures and epileptic encephalopathy. Although significant progress has occurred in understanding the genetic and molecular basis of TSC (25), still little insight into the pathogenesis of epilepsy exists in this disorder. The ideal TSC model (Table 4) would replicate the genetic defect (TSC1 or TSC2 gene mutation), the structural brain abnormalities (cortical tubers and subependymal nodules), spontaneous seizures with EEG correlates, and cognitive deficits seen in human TSC. Although several animal models of TSC are known, none provides representation of all of these TSC components. The Eker rat has a spontaneous germline mutation in which one TSC2 allele is inactivated, resulting in abnormal TSC2 gene product (tuberin). Eker rats have renal tumors and subependymal nodules, but cortical tubers are not ordinarily observed, even in two-hit models in which a somatic insult is superimposed on the genetic mutation (26,27). Eker rats exposed to a second hit do have a higher number of dysmorphic neurons and exhibit some level of cortical disorganization, but do not exhibit spontaneous seizures (although Eker rats may have a decreased threshold to induced seizures). Recently, memory alterations have been documented in Eker rats (28). In contrast, modeling attempts in mice, using conditional knockout strategies, have given rise to animals with spontaneous seizures but without the neuropathologic features typical of TSC. For example, a mouse conditional knockout of TSC1 (the gene that codes for the protein hamartin), in which the deletion is driven by the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter, shows abnormal cortical excitability, astrocyte neuropathology, spontaneous seizures, and cognitive deficiencies (29,30). Complementary in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed decreased glutamate-transport currents and impaired uptake of potassium through inward rectifier channels (31), suggesting potential mechanisms for brain hyperexcitability in these mice. Still, the absence of cortical tubers weakens the validity of these mice as a model of the human disorder. Further work with the conditional genetic manipulation approach (e.g., using a neuron-specific promoter system) may provide additional insights and yield neuropathologic features that more closely resemble the pathology of TSC. A major need in developing appropriate models of pediatric epilepsy is a better knowledge base of the disorders in question. Laboratory research can contribute to that knowledge base through studies of human material from autopsy specimens as well as of surgically resected tissue. Such studies will provide a better understanding of the structural, molecular, and functional abnormalities underlying epileptic circuits. Clearly, however, this material is limited and rarely allows the experimenter to manipulate key variables. Thus animal models will continue to play a pivotal role in advancing knowledge about the developmental epilepsies (Table 5). The choice of species for these studies is critical, as species (and even strain) differences have been shown to result in very different susceptibilities to seizures and their consequences (32). The choice of rats and mice to model epilepsy phenomena has been based largely on experimental convenience and on the large background of information about brain function in these species. For studies of the genetic bases of epilepsy, mice will certainly continue to be a valuable resource (33); studies of human genetic mutations associated with pediatric epilepsy syndromes should be pursued in these versatile mouse systems. Rodents will also be helpful in assessing the roles of gender and hormones in developmental epilepsy (34). However, the sequence and rate of ontogenetic steps in rodent brain development differ in significant ways from human brain development; thus rodents may not always model epilepsy pathophysiology adequately. Consideration should also be given, therefore, to other animals such as primates and pigs, in which aspects of human brain development may be more precisely reproduced. For example, piglets are used extensively in neonatology laboratories, and experimental techniques for maintaining stable systemic parameters are well established in this field (35). In contrast, future model development should also take advantage of simple systems—such as zebra fish, flies, and invertebrates—in which large-scale, fast-throughput studies can screen for relevant genes and drug responsiveness, as well as address specific mechanistic issues (36). Workshop participants stressed the importance, particularly in these simpler systems (and in the in vitro preparations) of defining the seizure phenotype carefully. Finally, computer modeling represents a relatively untapped approach to explore certain questions of cellular and network function in pediatric epilepsies (37). In all such considerations of animal choice, the experimental question should determine the optimal approach. Extensive discussion was held regarding technical advances that might facilitate our study and understanding of pediatric epilepsies. At the top of the list (Table 5) was the development of reduced-scale (e.g., for rat and mouse pups) “neonatal intensive care units” that would allow concurrent monitoring of several aspects of neurologic function: video-EEG, motor activity, and blood pressure and respiration parameters. Metabolic parameters in young rodents, both during and between seizures, have been underemphasized in experimental work in this field; in particular, temperature measurement and its regulation are critical parameters that require assiduous attention in neonatal rodents (38). Another critical need is miniaturized systems for EEG recording, especially in freely moving animals. In the last several years, technical advances have made it possible to carry out both short- and long-term electrophysiologic monitoring of spontaneous seizures in adult rodents. However, it remains very difficult to record EEG reliably in rats younger than age postnatal day 10, and even more challenging to record from immature mice. Capabilities for small animal neuroimaging (in modalities such as MRI, functional MRI, and PET) will add significantly to the understanding of structural and functional substrates of epilepsy during development. Large-scale molecular screening techniques, including proteomics and gene profiling with microarrays, must be incorporated into experimental protocols for pediatric epilepsy studies. Finally, general agreement was reached about the urgent need to develop more precise methods for behavioral characterization and cognitive testing, to assess the long-term effects of seizures in (and on) the developing brain (39). One feature of the current Workshop was the participation of investigators working on pediatric models outside the epilepsy field (e.g., in genetics and neurogenesis, in brain development and plasticity, in sleep and mental retardation, and in pathologies associated with ischemia and traumatic brain injury). Investigators in these fields have developed modeling approaches and insights that should be incorporated into the epilepsy research arena. The sharing of such approaches, across fields and across laboratories, remains an untapped but potentially rich resource (Table 5). Innovative approaches to networking and collaboration, including web-based interactions, are needed. Such approaches would include resource “centers” that might be shared across institutions, such as rodent “neonatal intensive care units” (with video-EEG capability and apparatus for behavioral testing), neuroimaging facilities, and genetic profiling centers. Collaboration between networks of investigators, spanning the spectrum of clinical and basic research, is essential for substantial progress in the pediatric epilepsy field. The recent study by Dzhala et al. (40), which identified a novel treatment for neonatal seizures, represents an example of fruitful collaboration between institutions, involving the integration of data from human autopsy material and animal investigations (both in vivo and in vitro). The ready availability of web-based information, tissue-distribution resources, and genetic models make interinstitutional projects not only necessary but obviously feasible. Comprehensive discussion about funding resources yielded a broad array of possibilities. We, as investigators, must convince traditional funding mechanisms (including NIH and private foundations) of the urgency of research on pediatric epilepsy disorders. In addition to the hypothesis-driven NIH R01 grants, model-driven grants through the R21 mechanism should be considered. Sources of funding for pilot grants include private foundations. A listing of these potential funding sources can be found under Resources in Epilepsy Research on the American Epilepsy Society website (http://www.aesnet.org/Visitors/Research/index.cfm). Workshop participants enthusiastically supported the idea of specific model development in the pediatric epilepsies. Even in this era of limited funding, advances in the field are not only scientifically feasible but also crucial for the optimal care of children with epilepsy. Over the long term, investments of time, resources, and scientific effort should be cost-effective in terms of health and human needs. Some of the issues discussed in this workshop stemmed from the NIH-Curing Epilepsy Conference report (developed in 2000), which identified specific gaps in our understanding of epilepsy and epileptogenesis, and set specific benchmarks of attainable goals (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/about_ninds/epilepsybenchmarks.htm). Many of these benchmarks focus specifically on a more complete understanding pediatric epilepsies and their underlying bases, so that we can develop better treatment options—and eventually “cures”—for these often devastating disorders.",

      "title": "The psychological basis of hunger and its dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "This article describes a new and emerging psychological perspective on hunger, together with the implications of that perspective, which is based upon learning and memory. Hunger is a psychological state characterized by a desire to eat. Historically, conceptions of hunger have largely been expressed in terms of physiology (eg, biological process X causes hunger). However, physiology neither offers a psychological account of hunger nor explains why memory impairment can eliminate hunger. Two forms of hunger are identified - specific and general. Specific hunger is for particular palatable foods. It involves recollecting episodic memories of eating that food, when an associated cue is encountered (eg, an advert). General hunger is a desire to eat triggered by temporal (eg, it is lunchtime) or interoceptive (eg, tummy rumble) cues. It involves semantic memory retrieval, which then augments the expected - remembered - pleasure for any food. Both hungers are supported by the medial temporal lobe memory system. Damage to this system can occur from eating a Western-style diet and, longer-term, from obesity and its consequences. Medial temporal lobe memory damage may cause deficits in specific hunger, but most especially in general hunger, resulting in little motivation to eat foods that the individual considers to be of low-to-moderate palatability, such as fruit and vegetables. The implications of this account for teaching people hunger, for how hunger is affected by diet, for public education, and pharmaceutical intervention, are discussed. Psychological concepts of hunger are widely used in nutritional practice. This article provides a new and emerging perspective on the psychological basis of hunger and its implications.",

      "title": "Associations of sleep disturbance with ADHD: implications for treatment",
      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly associated with disordered or disturbed sleep. The relationships of ADHD with sleep problems, psychiatric comorbidities and medications are complex and multidirectional. Evidence from published studies comparing sleep in individuals with ADHD with typically developing controls is most concordant for associations of ADHD with: hypopnea/apnea and peripheral limb movements in sleep or nocturnal motricity in polysomnographic studies; increased sleep onset latency and shorter sleep time in actigraphic studies; and bedtime resistance, difficulty with morning awakenings, sleep onset difficulties, sleep-disordered breathing, night awakenings and daytime sleepiness in subjective studies. ADHD is also frequently coincident with sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea, peripheral limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome and circadian-rhythm sleep disorders). Psychostimulant medications are associated with disrupted or disturbed sleep, but also 'paradoxically' calm some patients with ADHD for sleep by alleviating their symptoms. Long-acting formulations may have insufficient duration of action, leading to symptom rebound at bedtime. Current guidelines recommend assessment of sleep disturbance during evaluation of ADHD, and before initiation of pharmacotherapy, with healthy sleep practices the first-line option for addressing sleep problems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between ADHD and sleep, and presents a conceptual model of the modes of interaction: ADHD may cause sleep problems as an intrinsic feature of the disorder; sleep problems may cause or mimic ADHD; ADHD and sleep problems may interact, with reciprocal causation and possible involvement of comorbidity; and ADHD and sleep problems may share a common underlying neurological etiology.",

However, a robust neural system need not be a rigid circuit. Neuroplasticity enables appropriate adaptations to frequent or chronic disturbances that initiate active modifications in respiratory control such as weight gain or loss, altitude exposure or injury [1]. Studies of respiratory plasticity are intended to reveal how and why experience or changing conditions influence the control of breathing. Further, the respiratory system provides an ideal model to explore fundamental mechanisms of neuroplasticity for at least two reasons. First, the respiratory neural control networks produce a spontaneous rhythmic and quantifiable motor output under a wide range of in vivo and in vitro conditions. Second, clear functional significance can be ascribed to respiratory motor output: it represents breathing. Many influential models of neuroplasticity (e.g., hippocampal long-term potentiation; [2,3]) lack these advantages.",

According to recent research this is not true. More than 5% of children and 0. 5% of the adult population report nocturnal enuresis, meaning that 10% of enuretic children will remain bedwetters for life if left untreated, and nocturnal enuresis is perceived as a shameful condition, giving a significant impairment of self‐esteem at an age when an intact self‐image is extremely important for an optimal development of the child's personality.

There is no reason to assume, a priori, that the sleep of an older adult is necessarily problematic; in fact, many high-functioning older adults are satisfied with their sleep. When the various factors that can disrupt sleep—poor health, primary sleep disorders, poor sleep-hygiene practices (e.g., irregular sleep schedules and poor sleeping environments), and so on—are screened out, “optimally” or “successfully” aging older adults, assuming they remain healthy, can expect to experience little further change in their sleep and are not likely to experience excessive daytime sleepiness and the concomitant need to nap regularly during the day. Nevertheless, the majority of older adults, who are not optimally aging, suffer significant sleep disturbances from a variety of causes. Fortunately, our growing understanding of how sleep changes with aging and of the causes of these changes is informing ever-improving treatments for these disturbances, thereby helping to ensure that growing older does not mean sleeping poorly.",

However, not infrequently, the presence of non-quiet sleep leads patients or their families to consult their family physician, since movements during sleep may be associated with several somatic or mental disorders, and may result in decreased quality of life. There are several clinical syndromes of pathological movements during sleep, which are usually classified according to the sleep stage at which they tend to occur. While the restless leg syndrome is one of the most common movement disorders, it usually occurs during wakefulness but commonly results in insomnia and is frequently associated with the periodic leg movement disorder of sleep. The movement disorders under parasomnias consists predominantly of disorders of arousal, sleep-wake transition disorders (rhythmic movement disorders), and rapid eye movement (REM) related disorders. This review briefly describes these movement disorders in sleep, and highlights their diagnosis and treatment.

A good night’s rest and a stable sleep-wake rhythm are therefore very\nimportant. The sleep-wake rhythm is regulated by several brain structures. People\nwith an intellectual disability (ID) all have some form of brain dysfunction, and might\ntherefore be at risk for sleep disturbances.[1-2] During the process of ageing, brain\nstructures that are important in regulating the sleep-wake rhythm show functional deterioration,[\n3] resulting in for example waking up too early in the morning and daytime\nsleepiness. Also, the architecture of night sleep changes, leading to a decreased ability\nto initiate and maintain sleep.[4]\nAs a result of a combination of pre-existent brain damage and the age-related\nchanges, older adults with ID might be extra vulnerable to develop sleep-wake rhythm\ndisturbances. Until now no epidemiological research has been performed on this\ntopic in this population. Because life expectancy nowadays has increased in people\nwith ID, knowledge about night sleep and the sleep-wake rhythm is of importance for\noptimal care in this population. Also, for both epidemiological research and individual\ndiagnostics of sleep problems, an objective tool to investigate sleep that is suitable for\nolder adults with ID, is needed.\nIn this chapter, after some background information on intellectual disability, sleep\nregulation and ageing, we will introduce the Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disabilities\nstudy and the selected method to investigate sleep and the sleep-wake rhythm in\nthat study, followed by the aims and outline of this thesis.",

The prevalence of MND is approximately five per 100 000 and approximately 30% of patients have primary bulbar symptoms.1 Half of the patients die within 36 months of experiencing the first symptom.\n\nPresentation with ventilatory failure is recognised but uncommon,2 occurring in less than 5% of cases3; however, abnormalities of respiratory muscle function are frequently detectable.4 5 As the condition progresses respiratory muscle strength diminishes4 6; indeed, the rate of change in respiratory function is the only measurable parameter which predicts survival.1 When the load placed on the respiratory muscle pump exceeds the capacity of the respiratory muscles, then the patient is at risk of ventilatory failure. Initially abnormalities may be present only in sleep7 or on exercise8 but, frequently, established ventilatory failure ensues. Ventilatory failure is usually manifest by dyspnoea which may be worse on lying flat (if diaphragm weakness is prominent) or sitting upright (if expiratory muscle weakness predominates). More commonly there is generalised weakness and then there are no clear cut postural symptoms. Direct questioning may elicit symptoms suggestive of disordered sleep architecture—for example, daytime somnolence, difficulty concentrating, or “respiratory” nightmares—or carbon dioxide retention—for example, morning headache. Examination may show paradoxical abdominal motion during respiration. This indicates substantial diaphragm weakness9 combined with preservation of enough upper thoracic musculature to generate sufficient negative intrathoracic pressure to cause inward abdominal motion. In more advanced disease paradoxical motion may be difficult to elicit and the patient may simply appear tachypnoeic without useful rib cage movement.

      "abstract": "Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) report that exertion produces dramatic symptom worsening. We hypothesized this might be due to the exacerbation of an underlying sleep disorder, which we have previously demonstrated to exist.Female patients with CFS and matched healthy controls with no evidence of major depressive disorder were studied with overnight polysomnography on a baseline night and on a night after their performance of a maximal exercise test.CFS patients as a group had evidence for disturbed sleep compared with controls. Although exercise improved sleep for healthy subjects, it did not do this for the group as a whole. When we stratified the sample on the basis of self-reported sleepiness after a night's sleep, the patient group with reduced morning sleepiness showed improvement in sleep structure, whereas those with increased morning sleepiness continued to show evidence for sleep disruption.Sleep is disturbed in CFS patients as a group, but exercise does not exacerbate this sleep disturbance. Approximately half the patients studied actually sleep better after exercise. Therefore, activity-related symptom worsening is not caused by worsened sleep.",

The spectrum of sleep disorders mirrors the clinical population of patients seen in a family medicine practice with most patients with sleep disturbance receiving their medical care in the primary care setting [1]. Despite a high prevalence of sleep disorders, sleep complains are under-addressed by physicians.

These are due to drastic changes in living conditions such as prolonged work time, increased shift working, and various socio-psychological stresses. Sleep problems have been reported to strongly associate with emotional dysfunction in humans. Sleep loss cause not only daytime sleepiness and psychomotor impairment, but also emotional instability, anxiety and confusion, and chronic insomnia increases vulnerability to mood and anxiety disorders. Recent studies have revealed some of the neural basis of emotional regulation by sleep. For instance, continuous and accumulating sleep debt experienced in daily living could interfere with the functional regulation of the amygdala by ventral anterior cingulate cortex. And consequently this can induce an overreaction of the amygdala to negative emotional stimuli. Sleep-related mood disturbances may, in part, be attributable to the neural basis of emotional instability during sleep debt. In this text, recent findings on the functional linkage between sleep and emotional regulation have been reviewed.",

The present study investigated whether subclinical levels of anxiety were associated with sleep disturbance and daytime functioning in older adults who met diagnostic criteria for primary insomnia, and therefore did not meet criteria for depression or an anxiety disorder. After adjustment for depressive symptoms, elevated state anxiety was associated with higher levels of wake after sleep onset (measured by both actigraphy and sleep log) and shorter sleep onset latency (measured by sleep log). Higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with greater wake after sleep onset (measured by sleep log). Elevated state and trait anxiety were associated with worse social functioning, and higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with worse role functioning. Thus, subclinical anxiety symptoms may be an important target for clinical intervention to improve sleep and functioning in older adults with primary insomnia.",

The treatment of the child neurosis consists of 3 stages: 1. We must make clear to the child ( in the language of his age) and to the educator the dynamic connection between the symptoms and the empirically established play deficiency, in order to eliminate the inhibitory and misleading disease consciousness (liberation moment). 2. Next we have to organize systematically the life of the child according to his individual play urge, in order to get rid of the sickening play deficiency (\"scheduling the day\" moment). 3. Having effected the cure, it is necessary to supervise the child for some time by means of periodic checkups, in order to prevent possible relapse which might result from \"residual play sensitiveness\" (\"weaning\" moment).",

      "title": "Apnea",
      "abstract": "Apnea, from the Greek \"absence of breath,\" refers clinically to the partial or complete cessation of respiratory flow. Three types of apnea differ in their underlying pathophysiology as well as in their clinical presentations. Central apnea is the absence of respiratory effort from failure of brainstem neurons to generate an excitatory impulse and subsequently stimulate respiratory muscles. Obstructive apnea results from partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway despite normal brainstem excitation. Mixed apnea is characterized by both central and obstructive components. Understanding the differences among central, obstructive, and mixed apnea is essential for selecting appropriate and effective treatment.Central apnea can affect term neonates and infants as a consequence of their relatively immature brainstem respiratory centers. Clinically, central apneic episodes are characterized by a lack of chest wall motion and the absence of air flow. Brief episodes of apnea, which are fairly common, simply reflect the immaturity of the neural regulatory system, but an episode lasting more than 20 seconds usually is considered pathologic and may be accompanied by cyanosis, hypotonia, bradycardia, or pallor.Preterm neonates can present with idiopathic apnea of prematurity or with apnea from a variety of serious underlying conditions. The apneic episodes may be central, obstructive, or mixed. Idiopathic apnea, which typically has an onset from the second to the seventh day after birth, results from an immature brainstem in association with an underdeveloped upper airway, giving it a mixed clinical picture. It is the most common type of apnea seen in preterm neonates, with the risk varying inversely to gestational age. Resolution usually occurs by 37 to 40 weeks postconceptional age, but rarely may persist up to 48 weeks.When not idiopathic, apnea in a preterm neonate can be the consequence of a multitude of disease processes, including sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, seizure, pneumonia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and hypoglycemia. It is critical to differentiate between a stable preterm neonate who has self-limited idiopathic apnea and one whose apneic episodes signal a serious, potentially fatal illness. Markers that suggest high risk for underlying pathology include apnea on the first day after birth, apnea in infants older than 36 weeks of gestation, episodes associated with cyanosis, and severe episodes requiring intense resuscitation. Any of these factors is a signal for further evaluation and appropriate treatment of the underlying condition.Obstructive apnea typically occurs in older children, although it can affect infants. The upper airway may be obstructed in the nose (polyps, hypertrophied adenoids), in the oropharynx (enlarged tonsils, macroglossia), or in the larynx (subglottic stenosis, laryngomalacia). Clinically, children may present with a broad spectrum of findings, including snoring, respiratory distress while sleeping, behavioral problems, failure to thrive, and developmental delay. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is not a benign condition and, if severe, can lead to cor pulmonale and death.Because it can be so diverse in its presentation, OSA is not always easy to diagnose. Frequently, a child does not have obvious symptoms while awake or behaviors resulting from sleep disturbance may be attributed erroneously to another condition, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Failing to take a sleep history is one mistake; not giving serious credence to parental reports of snoring and restless sleep is another. Even when parents are questioned properly about their child's sleep, they may not be aware of habitual snoring. Children may not snore as loudly as adults or the parents may be deeply asleep when their child's snoring is most likely to occur (in the last third of the night, when the body's tone is most relaxed during REM sleep).Overall, 2% to 3% of children have sleep disorders, but a thorough sleep history is particularly important in children at special risk: those who have trisomy 21, craniofacial anomalies (Crouzon or Apert syndromes), or neuromuscular disorders (myotonic dystrophy). The following mnemonic tool created at Brown University's Child Development Center can guide an appropriate sleep history: Between 75% and 100% of children who have OSA snore. A comprehensive sleep history also should include questions about enuresis, which has a strong predictive value for OSA, as well as diaphoresis and hyperextension of the head during sleep.The physical examination findings may be entirely normal in children who have OSA. Careful measurement of weight and height is important; affected children may lose weight and fail to grow because of interrelated difficulties with eating and chronic hypoxemia. The association of obesity with OSA is more prevalent in the adult population; almost 30% of children who have OSA are underweight.The presence of dysmorphic facies, mouth breathing, hyponasal speech, or cleft palate should raise the physician's suspicion for OSA. A careful examination of the nose may reveal obstruction from polyps, septal deviation, hypertrophied adenoids, or even a foreign body. In the oropharynx, the size of the tonsils should be noted on a scale of 0 to 4; macroglossia (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, hypothyroidism), micrognathia (Pierre Robin or Goldenhar sequence), or retrognathia may predispose a child to OSA. A complete neurologic examination is indicated because OSA can be associated with cerebral palsy or hypotonia.Most children who have OSA have no laboratory evidence of their disorder. Polycythemia, respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography are present only in the most severe cases. Radiographs may be useful in determining the cause of OSA. Among children who do not have tonsillar hypertrophy, a lateral neck radiograph can assess the size of the adenoids. In the absence of adenoidal and tonsillar hypertrophy, nasopharyngoscopy may assist in determining the cause of OSA.Several different strategies are available for confirming the diagnosis of OSA. Overnight pulse oximetry with in-hospital observation has a high positive predictive value in confirming OSA. At home, parents can record a sleep audiotape, although one limitation of this technique is the inability to identify a component of central apnea. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) can provide additional information when results of a sleep history and audiotape are inconclusive. It evaluates daytime sleepiness by measuring how long it takes a patient to fall asleep at different times. Having a short mean sleep latency (<10 min) during the day is abnormal, but the MSLT is of limited use in pediatrics because excessive daytime sleepiness is more common with obesity, which is not the usual finding among children who have OSA.The gold standard for diagnosing OSA remains polysomnography (PSG). The four essential components of a polysomnogram are a chest wall motion detector, nasal air flow meter, heart rate monitor, and a pulse oximeter. More complex instruments may have a pH probe and provide electroencephalographic monitoring. In 1996, criteria were set to standardize PSG interpretation in children. An abnormal study is defined by an apnea index (AI) greater than 1, an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 5, blood carbon dioxide levels of 45 mEq/L (45 mmol/L) for more than 60% of sleep time or 50 mEq/L (50 mmol/L) for more than 10% of sleep time, and a minimum oxygen saturation lower than 92%.Not all children suspected of having OSA require PSG, particularly when the indication for a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is already clear. PSG can provide critical information when there is uncertainty about the severity of OSA, in the presence of severe neurologic disease, with a very young child, and with a medical condition that might complicate surgical intervention. The major disadvantages of PSG are its expense and the time required for the study.As Drs. Matiz and Roman point out, the association between OSA and obesity is not as strong in children as it is in adults. About one third of children who have OSA actually are underweight, which makes sense, considering how failure to thrive might well be the consequence of poor sleep and chronic hypoxemia in a growing organism. The association of massive obesity with hypoventilation, daytime somnolence, and OSA has been called the Pickwickian syndrome. In fact, the syndrome is misnamed. In Dickens' Pickwick Papers, the hero, although portly, is neither obese nor somnolent, and he is not remarkable for his snoring. Mr. Wardle's young servant, known as \"the fat boy, Joe,\" has all the appropriate characteristics, but \"Joe's syndrome\" doesn't have much of a ring.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances of infancy (troubles in falling asleep, in the duration of sleep, night waking) are now the subject of renewed interest. Recently, these sleep problems in babies and young children seem to have increased in frequency and severity. A pilot study of sleep disorders is underway at the child department of the Hopital de la Poterne des Peupliers and involves more than 80 children aged 0–18 months. Twenty-nine infants have been selected from this cohort with severe and persistent sleep disorders that began in the first 18 months of life. In the absence of a control group, all cases were selected carefully. Some of the characteristics of these children are discussed: Age, sex, associated troubles, modalities of soothing, effect of hypnotic drugs, development under treatment. Some of these children are noted to be very active. Quite often, the pregnancy was marked by a traumatic event or by depression or anxiety in the mother. During evaluation of the mother-child interaction, one often notes a withdrawal of the mother's cathexis toward her child, which can go along with hyperstimulation in the relationship. This withdrawal concerns the emotional and fantasied dimensions of the interaction. The child's reactions and initiatives can be paralleled with the mother's speech, motor, and emotional attitudes. Thus, sleep disorders in early childhood represent an opportunity to observe the modalities of emotional exchange between mother and child and a methodologically interesting situation for the assessment of mother-child relationships.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Sleep problems are prevalent in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and include psychophysiological insomnia, and sleep disturbances caused predominantly by circadian dysregulation. Studies using motion sensing wearables (including actigraphy) have shown a diverse range of rest activity patterns, including mis-timed sleep, irregular sleep, or non-24hr (free-running) sleep patterns. Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances impact negatively on functioning and quality of life, and long term poor sleep is linked to weight gain, and other serious physical health conditions. Many of the factors supposed to cause or maintain poor sleep in this group are modifiable through behavioural and environmental alterations. Methods An expert consensus study (Delphi study) was conducted to examine and explore the views of relevant experts, regarding the appropriate contents and format of an occupational therapy intervention to improve sleep in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Experts were recruited with expertise in: occupational therapy, sleep, insomnia, circadian rhythm, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Experts with clinical and/or research expertise were sought, as well as service users and carers. We conducted three rounds of online surveys, individual interviews, and a day of content presentation, comments and voting, and discussion groups with service users and carers. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and presented graphically for comparisons. Qualitative data (survey comments and interviews) was analysed using thematic analysis. Analysis and data collection was iterative; with later rounds exploring views raised during earlier rounds. The results informed the development of the intervention now being tested in a single group feasibility study recruiting twenty participants. Using mixed methods, this study will evaluate acceptability, homework adherence and trial related procedures, informing adjustments prior to larger scale testing. Results The Delphi study recruited and retained participants well (n=82 of target=85, 66% uptake from professionals approached, 97% completion), suggesting a high level of interest in this topic. Participants reached consensus regarding relevant content within the initial assessment, increasing daytime natural light exposure (when possible), approaches to evening routine, and the approach to activity and occupation. Views varied regarding the relative importance of sleep restriction and building ‘sleep drive’, versus reducing arousal such as through relaxation, mindfulness, or cognitive approaches to anxiety. Often service users’ and carers’ views reflected those of professionals, however on some areas views between these groups differed, such as acceptable levels of intervention burden, and regarding wearables. Overall views highlighted the importance of a tailored intervention, with adjustable and selectable elements. The tailoring of recommendations will be achieved through a thorough assessment, including longitudinal use of light and movement sensing wearables, and a detailed initial interview. Many intervention components are optional based on needs, and the homework recommendations from ‘core’ intervention elements will vary depending upon individual needs, preferences, and baseline problems and situation. Discussion The diversity of sleep disturbance presentations within this group poses a unique challenge when developing a brief first-line intervention. Individually tailored recommendations can be derived through the combination of wearable technology and self-report, and a growing body of work informing models of sleep disturbance in this group.",

It is characterized by a persistent and repetitive pattern of aggressive, noncompliant, intrusive, and poorly self-controlled behaviors that violate either the rights of others or age-appropriate societal norms.1 These behaviors have a significant impact on the daily functioning of the child or adolescent and on the ability of parents and other adults to manage them. The specific behavioral criteria for the diagnosis of conduct disorder can be conceptualized as either aggressive or nonaggressive in type (Table 1). Examples of aggressive behaviors are physical fighting and bullying, assault, vandalism, purse snatching, physical cruelty to persons or animals, breaking and entering, and arson. More serious aggressive behaviors are armed robbery, rape, and extortion. Nonaggressive behaviors of conduct disorder include substance abuse, persistent truancy, running away from home overnight, frequent lying in a variety of social settings, theft not involving a confrontation with a victim, and chronic violation of rules or the basic rights of others. Three subtypes of conduct disorder are identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 3rd edition.1 These are descriptions of the functional contexts in which the particular behavior problems occur. The group type involves problematic behaviors that occur as part of an activity with peers.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in athletes and are a risk factor for development of mental health symptoms and disorders. Sleep disorder is also a risk factor for prolonged, persistent post-concussive symptoms. Individuals who have a sleep disorder following concussion are more susceptible to developing prolonged post-concussive symptoms unless the sleep disorder is properly managed. Sleep disorders are divided into primary sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, and secondary sleep disorders that may result from other conditions such as pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. The particular type of sleep disorder must be diagnosed, and will guide both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies, as warranted.",

The asthmatic child personality is extremely various. It cannot be included in traditional psychiatric perspectives or psychological scheme. 2. The classical features of behaviour such as dependence and negation of aggressivity can appear frequently but are not specific. 3. In more than one third of cases, a particular system of interaction may occur, called \"allergic relation\", characterized by a) A lack of personal attachment (objectal relationship poorly differentiated), b) A need of fusional grasping to people and environment, c) A blocking-up the separation-individuation system. 4. In most cases a) A high emotional receptivity to traumatisms, b) Psychosomatic vulnerable structure of various types, b) Mental mechanisms leading to psychosomatic disorganization, especially a kind of depression quite obvious in severe forms. 5. So inferences may be drawn a) About the genesis of the asthmatic disease in which the immunologic personality cannot be parted from the whole, b) About the psychosomatic approach of asthma and its prevention. 6. These considerations are basically founded on the recent book of L Kreisler \"L'enfant du désordre psychosomatique\" (The child with psychosomatic disorders) Ed. Privat-Toulouse (France) 1981.",

The duration of each episode of any one sleep stage or any episode of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness was determined. After caffeine there was an increase in longer episodes of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but no significant change in the episode duration of any of the sleep stages. In the case of drug withdrawal there was no change in the episode duration of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but there was a significant shortening of episode duration in sleep stages 2 and 3+4, with a similar trend for REM sleep episodes. Caffeine 'insomnia' thus seems characterized by increased stability of wakefulness, and hypnotic withdrawal 'insomnia' by decreased stability fo sleep. The type of analysis undertaken in this study could increase understanding of other types of insomnia.",

Numerous studies have shown a high prevalence of sleep disorders in patients with CFS. However, non-restorative sleep and fatigue are frequently symptoms of the sleep disorders themselves, so primary sleep disorders have to be ruled out in many cases of CFS. This review was performed using a structured search of the MeSH terms ([Sleep] + [Chronic fatigue syndrome]) in the PubMed database. Identifying primary sleep disorders in patients meeting diagnostic criteria for CFS will allow for a more comprehensive treatment approach involving new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies that may improve quality of life for these patients. El síndrome de fatiga crónica (SFC) se caracteriza por la presencia de fatiga intratable y sueño no reparador, síntomas con una alta prevalencia en múltiples enfermedades y/o como efecto secundario de diferentes fármacos. Diferentes trabajos demostraron una alta prevalencia de los trastornos del sueño asociados al SFC. Además, los síntomas de sueño no reparador y fatiga son síntomas frecuentes en los trastornos del sueño, lo que hace que en muchos pacientes con SFC haya que descartar un trastorno de sueño primario. Este trabajo se ha realizado a través de una búsqueda sistematizada con términos MeSH ([Sleep] + [Chronic fatigue syndrome]) en la base de datos PubMed. La identificación de los diferentes trastornos primarios del sueño en los pacientes con criterios diagnósticos de SFC, nos permitiría realizar un abordaje del paciente más completo, con nuevas estrategias diagnósticas y terapéuticas que podrían mejorar la calidad de vida de estos pacientes.",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

Maintenance and restoration of sexual function, of which pregnancy is a consequential part, is a goal of neurological rehabilitation (1). In practice, however, professional attention to the sexual problems of people with disabilities (and perhaps in women with disabilities in particular) is often inadequate, delayed or non-existent. When undertaken, an assessment must take sensitive account of a patient's history, personality and social setting. It may be difficult to return to a pre-existing relationship following the acquisition of physical disability. For example, following a brain injury there may be personality change, unstable mood, and fatigability. Following a spinal injury there will be a change or loss in mobility, sexual responses and sensory functions. New sexual and relationship problems may not resolve spontaneously with time, and may become entrenched and unmanageable unless addressed expertly and appropriately in a timely way.",

Primitive reflexes develop in the womb, are present at birth in the full-term neonate. Postural reflexes emerge after birth and take up to three and a half years to be fully developed. Collectively, abnormality in the profile of these two groups of reflexes provides indications of neurological dysfunction or neurological immaturity. Spinal reflexes function at the base of the hierarchical control system. A weak or absent Moro reflex is seen in cases of upper motor neuron lesions; an asymmetrical Moro reflex at birth may indicate a fractured clavicle or an Erb's palsy. The fear paralysis reflex is a highly alert but immobile state involving one or several following physical changes.",

      "abstract": "Vigilance decline in narcolepsy has been observed repeatedly in task performance . However, the nature of this vigilance effect is not exactly clear. In order to investigate vigilance problems in narcolepsy, it would be informative to examine to what extent narcolepsy patients differ from healthy people in naturally occurring vigilance fluctuations throughout the day. A general tendency to perform worse has been reported , and this suggests that vigilance is constantly at a lower level. On the other hand, a greater post-lunch dip has been found on some measures . It has been argued that the most parsimonious explanation is an impairment of the circadian process in narcolepsy . Conversely, it is argued that an increased homeostatic sleep drive may affect the diurnal pattern. In most studies on narcolepsy, patients are allowed to nap 3, . Naps are known to increase performance and alertness. The alerting effect of a nap may well influence results and might cause a relative improvement in performance in the afternoon. Therefore, vigilance may decline continuously over the day in narcoleptic patients if naps are not permitted. In this case, the homeostatic sleep drive is likely to be increased, a view that has been suggested before . Although a relation between vigilance and memory is plausible, the literature does not fully clarify this issue, although it is agreed that a short nap seems to improve performance in narcoleptic patients . In view of the experimental results mentioned above, three hypotheses are tested. First, it is predicted that an enhanced sleep drive can explain the pattern in diurnal variation for narcoleptic patients. Hence, it is expected that performance and alertness in patients will gradually decline during the day if naps are not allowed. Secondly, it is predicted that narcoleptic patients are impaired on the demanding task in particular. Thirdly, it is hypothesized that vigilance and episodic memory performance are related. There should be a simultaneous drop in memory performance if vigilance declines and variation in memory performance should correlate with changes in vigilance.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of learning disabilities",
      "abstract": "Learning disabilities are a heterogeneous diagnostic category. As a specific disorder learning disabilities include reading disorders, disorders of written expression and mathematics disorders. As a general concept, learning disabilities may be categorised into four symptom complexes, which are not mutually exclusive: 1. dyslexia, 2. motor-perceptual; 3. language delay; 4. hyperactivity. In clinical settings these neurodevelopmental disorders are diagnosed in school-aged children. The most common referral reasons are significant difficulties in school achievement or difficulties in child adjustment and functioning that are manifested through behavioural and emotional difficulties caused by learning disabilities. Since academic achievement is an important aspect of self-esteem in childhood, school failure may result in many short-term and long-term consequences for the child’s functioning in narrow and broader social contexts, development of maladaptive behaviour and also cause the development of psychopathology. The most common short-term consequences include low academic and general self-esteem, lack of motivation for schooling and related obligations, behavioural disorders, a sense of overload in the child, peer relationship problems and a heightened level of family conflicts. The usual long-term outcomes are psychosomatic problems, affective disorders (depression, anxiety) and severe behavioural problems. Furthermore, longitudinal studies show the persistence of certain problems in adulthood.In summary, impairments should be adequately assessed to evaluate the cognitive deficits and strengths, and a precise diagnosis should be established. Once problem areas have been identified, special teaching strategies can be devised in collaboration with the school to circumvent handicaps. Also, an important part of intervention includes counselling of parents and children.",

      "abstract": "Rolandic epilepsy or benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is called benign because its seizures are usually favourable and due to the spontaneous normalisation of the electroencephalogram on reaching puberty. Nevertheless, evidence has been found of the impact on cognitive development with the presence of heterogeneous cognitive deficits, especially related to persistent intercritical discharges during non-REM sleep. The aim of this study is to examine the epileptogenic networks involved in the neuropsychological disorders of this pathology.A common feature of the atypical developments is persistent epileptic activity during slow sleep, which plays an important role in the development of the neurocognitive deficits that are associated to this pathology. Factors such as the age at onset of the epilepsy, the onset of the atypical development, the location of the interictal discharges and the continuous epileptic activity during sleep that persists for more than two years can trigger changes in the functioning of the neurocognitive networks. This may result in deficits in the neuropsychological functions, which may even be irreversible.A close clinical and electroencephalographic follow-up is necessary. Moreover, formal neuropsychological studies must be conducted as of the onset of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. This is even more necessary in cases in which there is an obvious atypical development in order to detect and prevent the neuropsychological deficits before they establish themselves on a definitive basis.Las alteraciones neuropsicologicas son frecuentes en la epilepsia rolandica y sus evoluciones atipicas.Introduccion. La epilepsia rolandica o epilepsia benigna de la infancia con puntas centrotemporales se denomina benigna debido a lo favorables que suelen ser sus crisis y a la espontanea normalizacion del electroencefalograma al llegar a la pubertad, aunque se ha demostrado el impacto sobre el desarrollo cognitivo con la presencia de deficits cognitivos heterogeneos, relacionados especialmente con las descargas intercriticas persistentes durante el sueño no REM. El objetivo de este trabajo es estudiar las redes epileptogenas involucradas en los trastornos neuropsicologicos de esta patologia. Desarrollo. Las evoluciones atipicas tienen en comun una actividad epileptica persistente durante el sueño lento, que desempeña un papel importante en el desarrollo de los deficits neurocognitivos que se asocian a esta patologia. Factores como la edad de inicio de la epilepsia, el inicio de la evolucion atipica, la localizacion de las descargas interictales y la actividad epileptica continua durante el sueño que persista durante mas de dos años pueden provocar cambios en el funcionamiento de las redes neurocognitivas, con los consecuentes deficits en las funciones neuropsicologicas, que incluso pueden resultar irreversibles. Conclusiones. Es necesario un seguimiento cercano tanto clinico como electroencefalografico; ademas, deben realizarse estudios neuropsicologicos formales desde el inicio de la epilepsia benigna de la infancia con puntas centrotemporales y mas en los casos que es evidente una evolucion atipica para detectar y prevenir los deficits neuropsicologicos antes de que se instauren definitivamente.",

      "abstract": "Neurophysiological analysis of the effects of selective and total paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) involving the replacement of paradoxical sleep (PS) phases by equivalent (as to duration) episodes of wakefulness is carried out. In contrast to the \"classical\" method of momentary awakening of the animal, a new method does not lead to: (1) the accumulation of PS need associated with more frequent PS onsets during deprivation; (2) PS rebound in a postdeprivation period; (3) dissociation of PS components, i.e. their occasional occurrence in other phases of the sleep-wakefulness cycle due to the phenomenon of self-deprivation; (4) increase in the rate of pontogeniculo-occipital (PGO) spikes, eye movements and heart rate during PS phases in the postdeprivation period. The application of selective and total PSD techniques caused no noticeable changes in the functional state and integrative activity of the brain, the latter warranting its successful use for treatment of some psychoneurological disturbances in clinics. The assumption has been advanced about the similarity of the neurochemical changes forming the need both for wakefulness and PS.",

For the last 6 years, I have taken a novel approach to somatic presentations of depressive illness.

      "abstract": "Wearable sleep-tracking technology is of growing use in the sleep and circadian fields, including for applications across other disciplines, inclusive of a variety of disease states. Patients increasingly present sleep data derived from their wearable devices to their providers and the ever-increasing availability of commercial devices and new-generation research/clinical tools has led to the wide adoption of wearables in research, which has become even more relevant given the discontinuation of the Philips Respironics Actiwatch. Standards for evaluating the performance of wearable sleep-tracking devices have been introduced and the available evidence suggests that consumer-grade devices exceed the performance of traditional actigraphy in assessing sleep as defined by polysomnogram. However, clear limitations exist, for example, the misclassification of wakefulness during the sleep period, problems with sleep tracking outside of the main sleep bout or nighttime period, artifacts, and unclear translation of performance to individuals with certain characteristics or comorbidities. This is of particular relevance when person-specific factors (like skin color or obesity) negatively impact sensor performance with the potential downstream impact of augmenting already existing healthcare disparities. However, wearable sleep-tracking technology holds great promise for our field, given features distinct from traditional actigraphy such as measurement of autonomic parameters, estimation of circadian features, and the potential to integrate other self-reported, objective, and passively recorded health indicators. Scientists face numerous decision points and barriers when incorporating traditional actigraphy, consumer-grade multi-sensor devices, or contemporary research/clinical-grade sleep trackers into their research. Considerations include wearable device capabilities and performance, target population and goals of the study, wearable device outputs and availability of raw and aggregate data, and data extraction, processing, and analysis. Given the difficulties in the implementation and utilization of wearable sleep-tracking technology in real-world research and clinical settings, the following State of the Science review requested by the Sleep Research Society aims to address the following questions. What data can wearable sleep-tracking devices provide? How accurate are these data? What should be taken into account when incorporating wearable sleep-tracking devices into research? These outstanding questions and surrounding considerations motivated this work, outlining practical recommendations for using wearable technology in sleep and circadian research.",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related painful erections (SRPE) are characterized by penile pain occurring during nocturnal erections, without apparent penile pathology. Sleep loss caused by the disorder may result in severe anxiety, mood disorders, irritability, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Until now, the phenomenon of SRPE has not been well understood. The rarity of the published cases probably does not reflect the actual prevalence, which is presumably over 1 percent. Because of the bizarre nature of the complaints, patients are often referred to a psychiatrist. The authors present the case of a 69-year-old patient, who, during frequent nocturnal awakenings, experienced hard-to-define burning, tingling sensations in symmetric hypogastric localisation. Sometimes the skin of both legs, and, occasionally, the arms and hands was involved, too. Initially, however, no definite erection-associated penile pain was present. Micturating quite a small amount just after awakening consistently resulted in immediate and complete relief. After two years, painful nocturnal erections reoccurring at stable intervals of 90–120 minutes during sleep developed to be the leading complaint. In default of urological or gastroenterological pathology, the patient has been referred to a psychiatrist. Quite futilely, mianserin and alprazolam, later sertralin and carbamazepine, respectively, were administered. Clozapine has also been tried out; however, it has to be rejected due to some adverse effects. Finally, 10 mg baclofen in the evening resulted in complete and permanent remission. This is consonant with the literature data stating that only clonazepam, baclofen and clozapine are likely to have long term beneficial effects in SRPE.",

Symptoms are quite diverse, but not specific to this disease entity. The most common are: concentration and memory problems, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, joint pain, sleep disturbances, headache. Moreover, autonomic nervous system functioning and post-exertional malaise examination is considered to be important in diagnosis of adolescent patients with ME/CFS. The presented analysis of research shows that adolescents with ME/CFS urge to be understood and believed regarding an illness that few understood. Continuing education and remaining the social activity in young ME/CFS patients seems to be crucial in maintaining quality of life. ME/CFS in adolescents might lead to significant problems related to the school absenteeism, poorer quality of life at school, school and academic achievement compared to healthy adolescents. Anxiety might co-occur with ME/CFS in adolescents. Supportive therapy for comorbidities could be considered, if needed. However, there is no established effective treatment for ME/CFS, for which there is urgent need. (JNNN 2020;9(2):76–79)",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by prolonged partial and/or intermittent complete (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) upper airway obstructions. The disruption of normal ventilation can be associated with hypoxemia and abnormal sleep patterns. OSA occurs predominantly during REM-sleep. Most affected children present with snoring and breathing problems during sleep. The prevalence of OSA in children is approximately 4%. OSA can be associated with daytime sleepiness and cognitive/behavioral complications like poor school performance and hyperactivity. Cardiovascular complications include pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and systemic hypertension. There is a significant association between apnea-/hypopnea-index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index with raised daytime and nocturnal blood pressure. There is an increasing prevalence of obesity in children. Obesity can interfere with sleep in different ways. A lack of sleep is associated with an increased risk for obesity. On the other hand, obesity can have a negative influence on sleep. An increased soft tissue mass and altered mechanics lead to an increased airflow resistance, causing upper airway obstruction. With the current epidemic of obesity the incidence of OSA due to obesity in younger children may become remarkable. The risk for systemic hypertension caused by obesity is independent from the risk for hypertension caused by obstructive sleep apnea. Insofar, blood pressure and sleep-related breathing should be monitored beginning with an obstructive AHI of 3/hour sleep. Children with OSA should be treated early enough. Prevention and early treatment of obesity as a risk factor for OSA as well as for hypertension is becoming an important social challenge.",

      "abstract": "Speech dysfluency (stuttering) is common in children. Although stuttering often resolves before adulthood, it can cause significant anxiety for children and their families. Stuttering speech patterns are often easily identifiable; when a child is learning to talk, repetition of sounds or words, prolonged pauses, or excessively long sounds in words usually occur. Secondary behaviors (e.g., eye blinking, jaw jerking, involuntary head or other movements) that accompany stuttering can further embarrass the child, leading to a fear of speaking. The etiology of stuttering is controversial, but contributing factors may include cognitive abilities, genetics, sex of the child, and environmental influences. Research has shown that more than 80 percent of stuttering cases are classified as developmental problems, although stuttering can also be classified as a neurologic or, less commonly, psychogenic problem. The initial assessment of patients who stutter addresses the severity of dysfluency; secondary behaviors; and the impact of stuttering, such as patient distress. Further testing is useful in assessing the need for therapy. Pharmacologic therapy has not been shown to improve stuttering. Encouraging patients to talk slowly and the use of fluency-shaping mechanisms such as delayed auditory feedback devices to slow the speech rate can help minimize or eliminate stuttering. For patients with persistent stuttering, controlled fluency or stuttering modification therapy may be effective.",

      "abstract": "Flurazepam, temazepam, and triazolam are compared in terms of initial and short term efficacy, effectiveness during intermediate and long term use, withdrawal effects, and general side effects. The usefulness of temazepam is considerably restricted since the drug is slowly absorbed; peak blood concentrations are not reached until 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. Consequently, while the majority of insomniac patients complain primarily of difficulty falling asleep, temazepam is not effective for this sleep complaint. Further, the drug has an intermediate elimination half-life and induces a significant degree of morning sleepiness (hangover). Rebound insomnia of a moderate degree occurs with some frequency following withdrawal of temazepam. Triazolam is effective initially and with short term use both for inducing and maintaining sleep. However, much of this effectiveness is lost with continued nightly use over an intermediate period (2 weeks). The drug has a rapid elimination rate; during drug administration, sleep may worsen in the final hours of the night (early morning insomnia), and following drug withdrawal, rebound insomnia is frequent, immediate, and severe. Side effects are frequent and include some morning sleepiness (before tolerance develops) and significant memory impairment and even episodes of amnesia. Triazolam may have a narrow margin of safety in that serious behavioral symptoms have been reported even with a 1-mg dose. Flurazepam is effective both for initiating and maintaining sleep with initial and short term drug administration. Further, its efficacy is maintained not only with intermediate term use but with long term drug use (4 weeks). Flurazepam is a long elimination half-life drug, and there is significant daytime sedation during short term use; with continued use this effect diminishes. Rebound insomnia has not been noted following withdrawal of flurazepam; there is a carry-over effectiveness into the first and second nights of withdrawal, and any withdrawal sleep disturbance would be expected to be infrequent, delayed in appearance, and mild in degree.",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related vehicle accidents (SRVAs) are a common form of highway accident, often wrongly attributed to other causes. SRVAs typically involve running off the road or into the back of another vehicle, with no braking beforehand. Because of a high impact speed these accidents are often serious. SRVAs peak around 02:00h-06:00h and 14:00h-16:00h, when daily sleepiness is naturally higher. Hence, time of day is a critical factor, as important as the duration of the drive. Most SRVAs are not due to sleep pathology. Many are work-related. Non-sleeping rest is no substitute for sleep. Sleep does not occur spontaneously without warning, and is preceded by feelings of increasing sleepiness of which drivers are quite aware. Driving impairment is usually worse than is realised by the sleepy driver. The best countermeasure is sleep, or even a short nap. Even more effective is the combination of a nap with caffeine.",

      "title": "Types of tinnitus (literature overview)",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus affects up to 40 % of the population in Western countries. One to three percent of the general populations report a significant reduction in their quality of life due to tinnitus through its effect on sleep and mood. Tinnitus presents a burden to the health care system that has been rising in recent years. Population-based studies provide crucial underpinning evidence, highlighting the need for further research to address issues around effective diagnosis and clinical management of this heterogeneous condition. The discussion is done on the basis of Claussen and Shulman classification of the four main groups of tinnitus types: type I — bruit (objective), type II — endogenous tinnitus (subjective maskable), type III — exogenous tinnitus (subjective non-maskable), type IV — slow brainstem degeneration syndrome. Type I: a) pulsatile tinnitus. It can have many causes; aneurism is the most dangerous condition. Mitral insufficiency, temporomandibular joint sounds may be associated with pulsatile tinnitus; b) non-pulsatile (or periodical): vessel sclerosis. Non-pulsatile, or periodical, otosclerosis (otospongiosis) is an idiopathic infiltrative process of the petrous temporal bone that may present with tinnitus. The most common type is fenestral otosclerosis (85 %), which is associated with conductive hearing loss. In a preliminary study, etidronate appeared to be an effective treatment for the neurootologic symptoms of otosclerosis. Type II, subjective maskable. Sensory neural hearing decrease (peripheral) might have several causes: disorder of the inner hair cells, outer hair cells (OHCs), acoustic neuritis, acoustic neurinoma. Discovering the roles of inner hair cells, OHCs, and auditory neurons in speech understanding in quiet and in the presence of background noise is currently a hot topic in the scientific community. Previous studies have suggested that the auditory nerve (AN) may play a role in speech understanding in the presence of background noise. S.G. Kujawa, M.C. Liberman (2009) have shown that noise exposure causes temporary damage to OHCs (as measured by distortion product otoacoustic emissions) and permanent damage to the AN (measured by a decrease in the wave I amplitude of the auditory brainstem response). These preliminary results suggest that both OHCs and the AN contribute to speech recognition in the presence of background noise. However, OHC damage may play a primary role in hearing difficulties in this complex listening situation. Type III, subjective non-maskable (with hyperacusis), mostly central. Many people with tinnitus also suffer from hyperacusis. Both clinical and basic scientific data indicate an overlap in pathophysiologic mechanisms. In a study, 935 (55 %) out of 1713 people were characterized as hyperacusis patients. Hyperacusis in tinnitus was associated with younger age, higher tinnitus-related, mental and general distress, and higher rates of pain disorders and vertigo. Blockers of H1 histaminic receptors, Ca channels and muscarinic blockers seem to be effective. Type IV, slow brainstem degeneration syndrome. Etiology: old age, severe head trauma, poisoning, neural infections. Manifestations: dizziness, emotional disturbances, cognitive impairment, tinnitus and headaches.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacotherapy for children and adolescents with sleep disorders: an overview Abstract. Sleep difficulties are a relevant symptom in childhood and adolescence with a prevalence of approximately 20 %. Because of the reduced psychosocial functioning and the burden of suffering associated with insomnia, effective treatment strategies are needed. If interventions such as the implementation of an adequate sleep hygiene and other non-drug treatment approaches are not sufficient, pharmacotherapeutic treatment is often considered. The present work provides a literature overview on the use of different substance classes in hypnotic indications. The use of melatonin in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder has been well studied and is associated with a positive effect on sleep in this patient group. To date, there is little evidence regarding the efficacy and tolerability of other medication in primary insomnia or sleep disorders in the context of other psychiatric disorders in minors. For this reason, non-drug treatment strategies are preferred and pharmacotherapy is only to be considered secondarily after critical examination.Zusammenfassung. Ein- und Durchschlafstörungen sind mit einer Prävalenz von etwa 20 % eine relevante Symptomatik im Kindes- und Jugendalter. Aufgrund des mit Insomnien oftmals verbundenen verminderten psychosozialen Funktionsniveaus und des sich einstellenden Leidensdrucks ist eine suffiziente Behandlung notwendig. Zeigen sich Maßnahmen wie eine angemessene Schlafhygiene und andere nichtmedikamentöse Therapieansätze als nicht ausreichend, wird oftmals eine pharmakotherapeutische Behandlung in Betracht gezogen. Die vorliegende Arbeit bietet eine Literaturübersicht zum Einsatz verschiedener Substanzklassen in hypnotischer Indikation. Der Einsatz von Melatonin bei Kindern und Jugendlichen mit Autismus-Spektrum-Störungen ist zwischenzeitlich gut untersucht und ist mit einem positiven Effekt auf den Schlaf bei dieser Patientengruppe assoziiert. Hinsichtlich der Wirksamkeit und Verträglichkeit anderer Wirkstoffe bei primären Insomnien bzw. Schlafstörungen im Kontext anderer psychiatrischer Erkrankungen bei Minderjährigen besteht bislang eine geringe Evidenz. Daher sind zunächst nichtmedikamentöse Behandlungsstrategien vorzuziehen und eine Pharmakotherapie erst sekundär und nach kritischer Abwägung zu erwägen.",

      "title": "A STUDY TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STROOP TASK PERFORMANCE TO IMPROVE VISUAL PERCEPTUAL DISCRIMINATION AMONG VARIOUS CHILDHOOD DISORDERS AT SELECTED HOME, PUDUCHERRY",
      "abstract": "Background: The Stroop effect is a simple phenomenon that reveals a lot about the brain processes information. The Stroop effect is our tendency to experience difficulty naming a physical color when it is used to spell the name of a different color. It is a neuropsychological test extensively used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute, well-known as the Stroop Effect. The childhood disorder is an any illness, impairment, or abnormal condition that affects primarily infants and children. Some of the childhood disorders like Mild Mental Retardation, Learning Disorders, Motor Skills Disorders, Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorders, Eating disorders of infancy or early childhood, Tic disorders. Visual perceptual discrimination is the brainÂ’s ability to accurately perceive information in a complex, fluid and confusing situation and, even more importantly, to accurately differentiate amongst confusable types of information and ability to identify detail seeing Items like differences in shape, color and orientation. Objectives: The main purpose of this study is to assess the level of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders. To evaluate the level of visual perceptual discrimination before and after administration of Stroop task performance among various childhood disorders. To associate the level of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables. Materials and Methods: The research approach used in the study was Quantitative in nature. Pre Â–Experimental One group Pre- test Post test design was used. Purposive Sampling technique was used to select the samples. A total of 30 ChildrenÂ’s with various childhood disorders were selected for this study. Visual Perceptual Discrimination checklist was used to assess the Visual Perceptual Discrimination Problems among children with childhood disorder and administering stroop task performance using Flashcard was used for intervention and Post test was conducted by using same tool in same manner. Results and Conclusion: The result showed that majority of the childhood disorders at selected home 26(86.7%) had low and 4(13.3%) had moderate level of visual perceptual discrimination during Pre test. The Calculated pairedÂ‘tÂ’ value was t= -8.55 and was found to be statistically significant at -P=&lt;0.001 level. After Intervention majority of childhood disorders at selected home 16(53.3%) had low and 14(46.7%) had moderate level of visual perceptual discrimination. There was area of residence and type of childhood disorders had shown statistically significant association between post testlevel of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables. The other demographic variable had not shown statistically significant association between the post-test level of visual Perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables .The researcher concluded that by administering Stroop task performance shows that the intervention helps in improving the level of visual perceptual discrimination in good range and found to be one of the helpful interventions in improving the level of visual perceptual discrimination among children with various childhood disorders.

      "title": "Depression, anxiety and stress among pregnant women: A community-based study",
      "abstract": "Sir, Pregnancy is supposed to be a time of emotional well-being in a woman's life, but for many women, this is a time of confusion, fear, sadness, anxiety, stress, and even depression. Mental health, in spite of being an important component of reproductive health, is often neglected. Moreover, in the absence of systematic screening, most antenatal mental disorders are not detected. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, between 14% and 23% of women will struggle with some symptoms of depression during pregnancy.[1] Depression in pregnancy may diminish one's capacity for self-care, precipitating inadequate nutrition, drug or alcohol abuse, and poor antenatal clinic attendance, all of which may compromise a woman's physical and mental health, may reduce optimal fetal monitoring, and might restrict the growth and development of the fetus. Performing antenatal screening is justified and seems reasonable since most postnatal depressive disorders begin during or before pregnancy. Anxiety during pregnancy has been found to be associated with depression as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. Various studies have shown a link between antenatal maternal stress and cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problem in a child. An in-depth community-based query has to be made during the antenatal period as most of the past studies have been hospital-based and postnatal centric. The importance of mental health in pregnancy can be emphasized by the fact that even the best obstetric care cannot give a desirable outcome of the pregnancy if the mental health issues of the expectant mother are not addressed at the right time and in the right manner. To generate local evidence to fill up the knowledge gap about the mental health problems faced by the antenatal females and to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in antenatal females, a cross-sectional community-based descriptive enquiry was conducted from January to October 2014 in Ghazipur, an urbanized village in East Delhi which is the field practice area of our institute. One hundred and sixty-five antenatal women who gave consent to participate in the study and residing in the area for 6 months or more were included in the study. The study participants who needed immediate medical attention and/or participant with chronic mental illness were not included in the study. The tool used for the study included the depression, anxiety, stress scale. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was found to be 25.5%, 63%, and 23%, respectively. Figure 1 shows the distribution of depression, anxiety, and stress based on severity.Figure 1: Severity of depression, anxiety, and stress among pregnant females (n = 165)The increased vulnerability for mental illness in pregnancy can be explained by the \"Biopsychosocial Model,\"[2] which integrates the biological, psychological, and social factors to explain the occurrence of mental illness. Pregnant females have increased biological vulnerability due to the hormonal maladjustment, psychological vulnerability due to apprehension for new life of motherhood, and social vulnerability due to the added demands of family support and care during this critical phase of her life. More community-based studies need to be done to increase the database of similar bigger epidemiological studies to be conducted in different social and cultural settings in India. Our study provided a quantitative descriptive enquiry, but some sensitive issues can be picked up only by qualitative study such as in-depth interviews or focus group discussion. There is now a need to move toward quality comprehensive antenatal services. The findings of our study indicate the need to incorporate mental health components in RCH (Reproductive & Child health) program. At the present junction, universal screening may not be a suitable strategy, but surely, it is a desirable and achievable goal in the future. Longitudinal prospective research is needed to establish the temporality of the onset of depression, anxiety, and stress in pregnancy. A control group of nonpregnant women with a similar sociodemographic profile may be a good estimate of the actual burden of mental health morbidities in pregnancy. Repeated probing on several occasions can build up the rapport and gain the confidence of the victim, so antenatal care visits are an ideal option as there are multiple chances of contact with the healthcare delivery system. Our study provided scoping bit in the base of these hitherto less explored and less examined and underappreciated issues related to pregnancies, on which further studies can be planned on a larger constructive framework and better-resourced methodologies.

Insomnia, fatigue, and sleepiness are the most frequent sleep complaints after traumatic brain injury. Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and parasomnias may also occur after a head injury. In addition, depression, anxiety, and pain are common brain injury comorbidities with significant influence on sleep quality. Two types of traumatic brain injury that may negatively impact sleep are acceleration/deceleration injuries causing generalized brain damage and contact injuries causing focal brain damage. Polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and/or actigraphy may be utilized to diagnose sleep disorders after a head injury. Depending on the disorder, treatment may include the use of medications, positive airway pressure, and/or behavioral modifications. Unfortunately, the treatment of sleep disorders associated with traumatic brain injury may not improve neuropsychological function or sleepiness.

Family and personal histories did not show epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, or (with 1 exception) previous somnambulism. Electrographic investigation revealed that all patients had normal waking‐sleep cycles but that 4 of them had epileptiform abnormalities on their electroencephalograms. All patients were treated with either phenytoin or carbamazepine, with cessation of the abnormal nocturnal behavior during follow‐up periods ranging from 9 to 48 months.

Approximately 4 percent of adult men and 2 percent of adult women are believed to have these conditions. In addition to having symptoms such as snoring, headaches, depression, decreased libido and fatigue, patients with sleep apnea are at risk for a range of severe complications secondary to recurrent hypoxia and hypercapnia during sleep.

      "title": "Children’s play after anaesthesia and surgery: background factors and associations to behaviour during anaesthetic induction",
      "abstract": "Children can experience anaesthetic induction as fearful and frightening and this can lead to postoperative behaviour changes and symptoms of high anxiety. A fearful experience can also lead to avoidant reactions due to raised negative emotions in situations similar to that, which evoked the fear. To analyse children's reactions after anaesthesia to anaesthetic play equipment, 49 children (three-six years old) were video-filmed during play with anaesthetic equipment 14 days after anaesthesia and surgery. The risk that the child avoided playing with anaesthetic equipment was increased if the child took the premedication unwillingly and if the child was younger. The risk for not telling about the experience was increased if the child took the premedication unwillingly and if the child showed signs of shyness. The risk for telling mostly unspecific memories increased if the child was younger and if the child showed signs of shyness. Avoidant reactions could bee seen in 50 percent of the children. It is important to be aware of the characteristics of a vulnerable child (age, shyness) and to meet the child without raising negative emotions in any part of the anaesthetic process, in order to avoid negative reactions in future encounters.",

      "title": "3. The Treatment of Excessive Somnolence With Stimulant Drugs",
      "abstract": "Controlling the symptom of excessive sleepiness is an important responsibility of sleep medicine. Our group has reported that methamphetamine, given in the morning at doses of 40-60 mg, allowed narcoleptics to function throughout the day at normal levels of sleep tendency and psychomotor functioning as measured by multiple sleep latency and performance testing. These findings are important because they are the first to show normalization of function in narcolepsy with pharmacotherapy and because the dose of stimulant utilized was more than twice the maximum recommended by the manufacturer. Because it is possible to essentially eliminate the disabling sleepiness of narcolepsy, at least in the short term, we suggest that the following principles be applied in the therapeutic use of stimulant drugs: 1) Pathological sleepiness warrants aggressive treatment when sustained alertness is necessary for individual or public safety; 2) Stimulant drugs are important in the therapeutic approach to patients with pathological sleepiness; 3) The prime goal, although sometimes unachievable, should be symptom-free daytime functioning. It is important that, during therapy, a period of symptom-free daytime functioning be achieved for a frame of reference for evaluating future treatments; 4) Treatment efficacy should be assessed periodically with objective techniques such as the multiple sleep latency test or the maintenance of wakefulness test; 5) In some cases, stimulant doses may exceed the manufacturer's recommendations. However, the clinician should be guided by the prime goal of therapy, the patient's needs and the patient's ability to tolerate the chosen therapy.",

      "title": "Insomnia and its Ayurveda Management– A Critical Review",
      "abstract": "Sleep is one of the basic and vital necessities of the body. Sleep is a normal biological process that provides the body (Sharir) and intellect (Mann) enough rest. Because of this, Ayurveda emphasises the importance of sleep, referring to it as Trayoupasthambh (Ahara-dietary habits, Nidra-sleep pattern, and Brahrnacharya-celibacy), (three support pillars). According to the text, Dhatu Samyata (the balance of the body constituents) depends on sleep. Particularly, the state of one's food and sleep affects obesity and emaciation. A careful review of the Ayurvedic medical literature reveals that increased Vata, old age, habit, and indulgence in work are the main causes of the Anidra (sleeplessness). This condition is also a consequence of a variety of diseases, and a number of ailments are caused and aggravated by inadequate sleep. In Ayurvedic literature, terms for insomnia include Anidra, Nidranasha, and Asvapna. Insomnia is a sleep disorder where people experience difficulty in sleeping or inadequate, poor-quality sleep. They may have trouble falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night with difficulty returning to sleep, and waking up too early in the morning. However, insufficient sleep increases the risk of numerous lifestyle-related diseases and impairs working capacity and concentration. Therefore the current article discusses the causes, effects, and treatment options for insomnia from an Ayurvedic perspective.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is the most commonly encountered of the circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSDs), and is often confused with sleep initiation insomnia. It typically emerges in teenage years and persists into adulthood. In essence, people with the disorder have an abnormally delayed major sleep episode relative to the dark phase of the solar cycle, and hence great difficulty initiating sleep at an appropriately early time, and, as a knock-on effect, waking at a desirable time in the morning, leading to chronic, and often quite severe sleep restriction trying to conform to a 9 to 5 schedule. As a result, sleep on free days is often extended in compensation. When released from such schedule constraints, sleep duration and quality is normal; it is just delayed. This review highlights elements of our current understanding of the epidemiology, associations and pathophysiology of the disorder, before discussing how some of our knowledge of sleep and circadian physiology can be applied to guide treatment of it.",

The condition can manifest itself in several ways and can be triggered in different scenarios, facts that render it a peculiar and multifaceted clinical entity. Nosologically, insomnia can be understood as a symptom or as a disorder with its own characteristics and has a chronic course. Insomnia disorder is more common among women and older adults, as well as in social risk strata, and is usually associated with comorbidities, particularly mental disorders. The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder have changed as new perspectives emerge. The cause-based classification (e.g., secondary to clinical diseases; associated with poor sleep hygiene) was abandoned in the latest editions of clinical manuals, which combined the subdivisions into a single entity, insomnia disorder. There are varied pathophysiological mechanisms that involve physiological and psychological features. The chronification of insomnia is more easily understood based on psychosocial models, especially Spielman's model that explains the development and maintenance of insomnia based on predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. The most recent challenge is to determine new clinical phenotypes that allow a more assertive approach and treatment.",

In the great majority of cases consciousness remains unclouded, judgment fairly clear, memory good and the moral sense normal, until the end or very near the end. Emotional control, when we consider that almost always the patient, if an adult, knows he is suffering from a very serious disease, is usually better than would be expected. When, then, mental symptoms do occur, three questions arise: (1) Is the abnormal mental state a mere accidental complication, merely happening at the time of the tetanus and in no way caused by it? (2) Is it due to the medication employed? (3) Is it the direct result of the exhaustion produced by the disease or a result of a secondary intoxication set up by the primary intoxication of the tetanus bacillus?

      "abstract": "<ns4:p>There is a growing interest in personalized and preventive medicine initiatives that leverage serious patient engagement, such as those initiated and pursued among participants in the quantified-self movement. However, many of the self-assessments that result are not rooted in good scientific practices, such as exploiting controls, dose escalation strategies, multiple endpoint monitoring, etc. Areas where individual monitoring and health assessments have great potential involve sleep and behavior, as there are a number of very problematic sleep and behavior-related conditions that are hard to treat without personalization. For example, winter depression or seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a serious, recurrent, atypical depressive disorder impacting millions each year. In order to prevent yearly recurrence antidepressant drugs are used to prophylactically treat SAD. In turn, these antidepressant drugs can affect sleep patterns, further exacerbating the condition. Because of this, possibly unique combinatorial or ‘polypharmaceutical’ interventions involving sleep aids may be prescribed. However, little research into the effects of such polypharmacy on the long-term sleep quality of treated individuals has been pursued. Employing wireless monitoring in a patient-centered study we sought to gain insight into the influence of polypharmacy on sleep patterns and the optimal course of therapy for an individual being treated for SAD with duloxetine (Cymbalta) and temazepam. We analyzed continuous-time sleep data while dosages and combinations of these agents were varied. We found that the administration of Cymbalta led to an exacerbation of the subject’s symptoms in a statistically significant way. We argue that such analyses may be necessary to effectively treat individuals with similar overall clinical manifestations and diagnosis, despite their having a unique set of symptoms, genetic profiles and exposure histories. We also consider the limitations of our study and areas for further research.</ns4:p>",

      "abstract": "Review of epidemiological and clinical studies suggests that sleep disorders are disproportionately observed in specific headache diagnoses (eg, migraine, tension-type, cluster) and other nonspecific headache patterns (ie, chronic daily headache, \"awakening\" or morning headache). Interestingly, the sleep disorders associated with headache are of varied types, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), periodic limb movement disorder, circadian rhythm disorder, insomnia, and hypersomnia. Headache, particularly morning headache and chronic headache, may be consequent to, or aggravated by, a sleep disorder, and management of the sleep disorder may improve or resolve the headache. Sleep-disordered breathing is the best example of this relationship. Insomnia is the sleep disorder most often cited by clinical headache populations. Depression and anxiety are comorbid with both headache and sleep disorders (especially insomnia) and consideration of the full headache-sleep-affective symptom constellation may yield opportunities to maximize treatment. This paper reviews the comorbidity of headache and sleep disorders (including coexisting psychiatric symptoms where available). Clinical implications for headache evaluation are presented. Sleep screening strategies conducive to headache practice are described. Consideration of the spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing is encouraged in the headache population, including awareness of potential upper airway resistance syndrome in headache patients lacking traditional risk factors for OSA. Pharmacologic and behavioral sleep regulation strategies are offered that are also compatible with treatment of primary headache.",

Critically ill patients experience pain more readily than healthy subjects; a phenomenon known as hypernociception. The most painful experiences for ICU patients are endotracheal suctioning and being turned in bed. In addition, many patients have pain at rest without a noxious stimulus [1]. This decreased threshold of pain in the ICU has been attributed to immobility and systemic inflammation. In addition to pain, ICU patients often suffer from stress, which has been frequently attributed to painful procedures. Other factors that may play a role in ICU stress include inability to communicate due to endotracheal intubation, interruption of sleep, hallucinations, and nightmares. This stressful experience is not without complications, as one retrospective study found that 25% of ICU patients with self-reported stressful experiences during their ICU stay, such as nightmares, anxiety, respiratory distress, or pain, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder four years later [2], thus, the importance of adequate analgesia and sedation to achieve patient comfort.",

NPD is characterized by sudden arousal followed by motor agitation with dystonic posturing, and semipurposeful activity recurring several times per night. When short-lasting, NPD may respond favorably to carbamazepine. ENWs are unusual episodes of ambulation, with unintelligible speech, screaming, and complex, often violent, behavior that responds to anticonvulsants. In both short-lasting NPD and ENWs, electroencephalography may show some evidence of epilepsy; NPD is clinically similar to the frontal lobe seizures that arise mesially or in depth. Paroxysmal arousals (PAs) are even shorter episodes of arousal or awakening during nonrapid eye movement sleep, associated with transient dystonic posturing and related to the short-lasting NPD. PAs, short-lasting NPD, and ENWs probably represent a spectrum of peculiar sleep-related epileptic seizures.",

      "abstract": "Executive summary:  Frailty is when the body gradually loses its in-built reserve and becomes vulnerable to sudden changes in health triggered by stress or minor illness such as a urinary tract infection.  Frailty increases the risk of unfavourable health outcomes including falls, disability, admission to hospital, need for long-term care, poorer recovery and reduced quality of life compared to those who are not frail.  Prefrailty is an intermediate stage between non-frail and frail, with loss of in-built reserves but the ability to recover after a stressor event.  The prefrail have more than twice the risk of becoming frail compared to those who are non-frail.  Evidence suggests the ‘prefrail’ state may be a window of opportunity for effective interventions.  Potential interventions include physical activity alone or in combination with nutrition and/or brain training.  Evidence for interventions targeting other aspects of frailty such as cognition, social outcomes and psychosocial wellbeing (depression and loneliness) is limited but have been advocated.  The use of Information Communication Technology (ICT)/eHealth in frailty interventions demonstrates potential for self-management, improved health and cost effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Symptom Control at the End of Life Abstract. Patients with advanced disease suffer from multiple physical and psychological symptoms. These include pain, weakness, lack of energy, weight loss, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression. In the dying phase, death rattle, delirium and terminal agitation may be additional problems. Palliative care focusses on alleviating these symptoms, taking into account the physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimension. Main principles of symptom control in palliative care are 1) considering differential diagnoses of the causes of the symptom to be able to treat potentially reversible causes, 2) using preventive measures and 3) symptomatic treatment - on its own or in combination with causal therapy. The following should be noted regarding pharmacological treatment: In case of permanent symptoms, the drugs have to be given at fixed times, in accordance with their duration of action, to achieve a constant blood level. In addition to this regular drug administration, prn medication should be prescribed, e. g., for pain, breathlessness, and nausea. If oral administration is not possible, drugs can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or transdermally via patches. Non-pharmacological measures can be used additionally or primarily for symptom control. This paper presents important aspects of symptom control for pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression as well as for symptoms in the dying phase. It concludes by adding a few words on sedation in palliative care as a measure of last resort.Zusammenfassung. Patient_innen in fortgeschrittenen Krankheitsstadien leiden unter vielfältigen physischen und psychischen Beschwerden. Dazu gehören Schmerzen, Schwäche, Energielosigkeit, Gewichtsverlust, Atemnot, Übelkeit, Erbrechen, Verstopfung und Depression. In der Sterbephase können Rasselatmung, Delir und / oder terminale Unruhe hinzukommen. Der Fokus palliativmedizinischer Behandlung liegt auf der Linderung dieser belastenden Symptome unter Berücksichtigung der körperlichen, psychischen, sozialen und spirituellen Dimension. Zu den Grundsätzen der palliativmedizinischen Symptomkontrolle gehören 1) eine angemessene differentialdiagnostische Ursachenklärung des Symptoms zur Behandlung potenziell reversibler Ursachen, 2) der Einsatz von präventiven Massnahmen und 3) die Durchführung einer symptomatischen Therapie – allein oder parallel zu einer ursächlichen Therapie. Bezüglich der medikamentösen Therapiemassnahmen ist Folgendes zu beachten: Bei dauerhaft vorhandenen Symptomen müssen die Medikamente entsprechend ihrer Wirkdauer nach einem festen Zeitschema gegeben werden, um einen möglichst konstanten Wirkspiegel zu erreichen. Zusätzlich zu einer solchen Dauermedikation ist zum Beispiel für Schmerzen, Atemnot und Übelkeit Bedarfsmedikation zu verschreiben. Wenn die orale Gabe nicht möglich ist, können Medikamente intravenös, subkutan oder transdermal mittels Pflaster verabreicht werden. Nichtmedikamentöse Massnahmen können ergänzend oder auch primär zur Symptomlinderung eingesetzt werden. Dieser Beitrag stellt wichtige Aspekte der Symptomkontrolle bei Schmerzen, Atemnot, Übelkeit und Erbrechen, Obstipation, Depression sowie bei Symptomen in der Sterbephase vor und schliesst mit wenigen Worten zum Thema «Sedierung in der Palliativversorgung» als Ultima-Ratio-Massnahme.",

      "abstract": "Thyroid hormone is essential for the growth and maturation of many target tissues, including the brain and skeleton. As a result, abnormalities of thyroid gland function in infancy and childhood result not only in the metabolic consequences of thyroid dysfunction seen in adult patients, but in unique effects on the growth and /or maturation of these thyroid hormone-dependent tissues as well. In most instances, there are critical windows of time for thyroid hormone-dependent development and so the specific clinical consequence of thyroid dysfunction depends on the age of the infant or child. For example, newborn infants with congenital hypothyroidism frequently have hyperbilirubinemia, and delayed skeletal maturation, reflecting immaturity of liver and bone, respectively, and they are at risk of permanent mental retardation if thyroid hormone therapy is delayed or inadequate; their size at birth, however, is normal. In contrast, hypothyroidism that develops after the age of three years (when most thyroid hormone-dependent brain development is complete) is characterized predominantly by a deceleration in linear growth and skeletal maturation but there is no permanent effect on cognitive development. In general, infants with severe defects in thyroid gland development or inborn errors of thyroid hormonogenesis present in infancy whereas babies with less severe defects or acquired abnormalities, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, present later in childhood and adolescence. In the newborn infant , thyroid function is influenced not only by the neonate ’ s own thyroid gland but by the transplacental passage from the mother of factors that affect the fetal thyroid gland.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder (SRRMD) is characterized by repetitive rhythmic motor behaviors involving large muscle groups that occur predominantly during stage N1 sleep. SSRMs are common in infants and children but they usually spontaneously resolve before adolescence. This case presents a rare adult case of SRRMD. Report of case(s) A 60-year-old man initially presents to clinic for evaluation of repetitive movements needed to initiate sleep. Patient reports the problem starting in his childhood, where he needs to rock and roll intentionally in bed to fall asleep. He had been prescribed clonazepam 2mg and had been taking this along with doxylamine and melatonin nightly, but still reports frequent nocturnal awakenings due to body rolling. He specifically denies any hypnic kicking/jerking, or discomfort in legs while falling asleep. Patient has no excessive alcohol consumption, marijuana, or illicit drug use. Differentials for the patient’s condition include hyperarousal, chronic anxiety, iron deficiency, sleep-related breathing disorder, and rhythmic movement disorder. Patient consequently underwent an in-lab diagnostic polysomnography study which showed no evidence of sleep-related breathing disorders with AHI of 1.6 (AASM 3%). Sleep efficiency was low at 60.8% and sleep architecture showed decreased REM sleep and decreased N3 sleep. Rhythmic movements were noted during sleep and it was manifested by excessive transient muscle activity in both limb &amp; chin EMG leads and also whole body rocking in the video recording. Moderate periodic limb movements were noted with PLM index to 17. Patient was seen in clinic 6 months later with persistent symptoms and his dose of clonazepam was increased slowly to 2.5 mg and then 3 mg. On the 3 mg of clonazepam, patient had resolution of symptoms. Conclusion Our case describes a patient who had SRRMs that commenced in childhood persisting well into adulthood. Reported adult cases of SRRMD are few, and have been associated with sleep apnea, REM sleep behavior disorder, and RLS, while many remain idiopathic such as the case with this patient. While benzodiazepines are still first line for SRRMD, further work up and investigation into possible comorbid conditions could yield insight into the etiology and offer alternative treatment options to patients.

      "title": "Blackout",
      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder which occurs in a large number of people, it can have a lot of different causes. Short lasting (acute) insomnias are mostly results of stressful situations which a person experiences in his or hers life, and they usually end when the source of the stress is removed. Chronic insomias have different causes and they are frequently associated with psyhological problems. Treatment of insomnia, depending on the severity, cause and the individual patient, can be simple or very complicated. Acute insomnia usually doesn't require special therapy, or if therapy is needed it is not long lasting and usually it doesn't show severe complications with it's use. Chronic insomnia can have different causes and it's therapy is usually long lasting. Pharmacotherapeutic possibilities of insomia treatment are usually based on administration of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists (benzodiazepines and Z-drugs), but there are other options, such as antidepressants, ramelteon, melatonin, valerian, H1-antihistaminics and L-tryptophan. Benzodiazepine receptor antagonists show good results in shortening sleep onset latency, sleep duaration and sleep quality. Problems with the use of bendodiazepine receptor agonists are shown in daytime simptoms (fatigue, hangovers, restlessness) and the possibility of tolerance and dependence after longer use. Non pharmacological treatment are thought of as different methods of psyhological bihevioral therapy. The advantage here is that they show good results in shortening sleep onset latency, sleep duaration and sleep quality, and they are safe as a long term therapy option. The problem with this type of therapy is that it is expensive, it requiers specially trained experts and it doesn't show immediate results. Combined therapy has all the advantages of psyhological bihevioral therapy, with avoiding side effects which occure with pharmacological treatments. Alternative methods, such as acupuncture, acupressure, yoga and tay-chi are other methods of insomnia treatment, but there are not a lot of studies in this field, and the ones that have been made have inconsistent results. When choosing a therapy option, one should always have in mind that it can be long lasting, and therefore the individuality of each patient should get the most attention, so the best possible, but affordable option can be determined.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

      "title": "How once-nightly sodium oxybate is processed in the body in healthy volunteers: a plain language summary",
      "abstract": "What is this summary about? This is a plain language summary of an article originally published in the journal Sleep Medicine. Narcolepsy is a sleep condition in which people have periods of extreme sleepiness during the day. People with narcolepsy may also have symptoms of muscle weakness (cataplexy); seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or feeling something that seems real but isn't actually there before falling asleep or while waking up (hallucinations); an inability to move before falling asleep or while waking up (sleep paralysis); and poor sleep at night. Sodium oxybate (SXB for short) has been used to treat narcolepsy for over 20 years. For more than 20 years, the only available form of SXB needed to be taken twice each night. Twice-nightly SXB (TN-SXB) requires people to take the first dose at bedtime. Most people fall asleep within 5 to 15 minutes after the first dose. Patients then need to wake up and take the second dose of TN-SXB 2.5 to 4 hours later, which is when most of the medicine has left the body. The United States Food and Drug Administration (also called FDA) approved a once-nightly form of SXB called LUMRYZ ™ (sodium oxybate for extended-release oral suspension; ON-SXB for short) in May 2023. ON-SXB treats excessive daytime sleepiness and muscle weakness, also known as cataplexy. People with narcolepsy who take ON-SXB only need to take 1 dose at bedtime. This summary describes a study that looked at how ON-SXB enters, travels through, and exits the body of healthy volunteers (people without narcolepsy). The study measured the amount of SXB in the blood after taking SXB in 2 different ways: as a once-nightly version and as a twice-nightly version. Looking at the amount of ON-SXB and TN-SXB in the blood at different time points helps researchers see if people who take the 2 medicines, with different dosing, have the same amount of drug in the body overnight. What were the results? Overall, the study found that healthy volunteers had the same amount of SXB in their bodies after taking ON-SXB as they did after taking TN-SXB. When they took the same amounts of ON-SXB and TN-SXB, the SXB stayed in their bodies for similar amounts of time. The highest amount and the total amount of SXB in the participants' blood were similar with ON-SXB and TN-SXB. The amount of SXB in the participants' blood 8 hours after taking the medicine was significantly lower with ON-SXB than with TN-SXB. This means that people taking ON-SXB will have less medication in their blood when they wake up the next morning and may be less groggy. What do the results mean? The results mean that if people with narcolepsy take the same dose amount of ON-SXB or TN-SXB, their bodies will receive the same amount of SXB in their blood. ON-SXB provides an option for people with narcolepsy to take their medicine once at bedtime without the need for a middle-of-the-night dose, which can improve quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Neurogenic dysphagia results from sensorimotor impairment of the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing due to a neurologic disorder. The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia include drooling, difficulty initiating swallowing, nasal regurgitation, difficulty managing secretions, choke/cough episodes while feeding, and food sticking in the throat. If unrecognized and untreated, neurogenic dysphagia can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, and respiratory complications. The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia may be relatively inapparent on account of both compensation for swallowing impairment and diminution of the laryngeal cough reflex due to a variety of factors. Patients with symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia should undergo videofluoroscopy of swallowing, which in the case of neurogenic dysphagia typically reveals impairment of oropharyngeal motor performance and/or laryngeal protection. The many causes of neurogenic dysphagia include stroke, head trauma, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease and myopathy. Evaluation of the cause of unexplained neurogenic dysphagia should include consultation by a neurologist, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, blood tests (routine studies plus muscle enzymes, thyroid screening, vitamin B12 and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies), electromyography/nerve conduction studies, and, in certain cases, muscle biopsy or cerebrospinal fluid examination. Treatment of neurogenic dysphagia involves treatment of the underlying neurologic disorder (if possible), swallowing therapy (if oral feeding is reasonably safe to attempt) and gastrostomy (if oral feeding is unsafe or inadequate).",

Pain stimuli disturb sleep and nonpainful stimuli [e.g., noise] that disrupt sleep [e.g., slow wave sleep] cause unrefreshing sleep, myalgia, and fatigue. Forced awakenings from sleep reduce pain inhibition and yields pain and nonpainful symptoms. Neurotransmitter dysfunctions, for example, central nervous system serotonin and substance P affect both sleep and pain. In clinical studies of FMS and CFS, unrefreshing sleep is associated with frequent periodic electroencephalogram arousals from sleep, i.e., the cyclical alternating pattern, sleep apneas, and periodic limb movements.Conclusions: These experimental and clinical findings have clinical and therapeutic implications in the assessment and management of FMS. Diurnal sleep/wake-related physiological studies provide objective evidence that further the understanding of FMS and chronic fatigue syndrome. Preliminary studies of novel treatments that aim to facilitate restorative sleep suggest a rationale for better management of FMS and related illnesses.",

      "abstract": "During sleep, infants with obstructive sleep apneas are characterised by snoring, laborious breathing, and profuse sweating. During wakefulness, they may have breath-holding spells, and during feeding, difficult breathing and swallowing coordination. Abnormal weight, difficult growth, and recurring ear infections may also develop. During sleep apneas, cinefiuoroscopy shows approximation of tongue and hypopharyngeal tissues, with an obliteration of the air space. The obstructed breaths occur mainly in REM, and light NREM sleep, associated with total short sleep time, and frequent arousals. Preterm infants, and term neonates are more prone to obstructive apneas than older healthy infants. Apneas are more frequently seen in boys and in case of excess in body weight. Obstructive apneas are frequently associated with upper airway anatomic abnormalities: malformations, soft tissue infiltration, and neurologic lesions impairing muscle contractions. Alterations of the autonomic nervous control may induce airways obstructions. Contributing factors include mucopolysaccharide storage disease, hypothyroidism, or Down’s syndrome. Superimposed factors may occur, such as nasal obstruction, secretions in the airways, or tissue edema. Pressure- and chemo-sensitive reflexes may also favor obstruction. Environmental factors also contribute to the development of sleep apneas: body position, neck flexion, sleep deprivation, or the effects of sedative drugs.",

      "title": "0863 A Unique case of sleep state misperception in an elderly patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Insomnia is a widespread condition, especially in the elderly population. While the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) third edition appropriately removed primary insomnia subtypes from the classification, our case illustrates the importance of these factors in considering a chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis. We present a case of severe subjective insomnia with no apparent objective findings, instead with evidence of excellent sleep efficiency on the contrary. Report of Cases: A 76-year-old male with a past medical history of anxiety and a recent diagnosis of early Parkinson's disease presented to the Sleep medicine clinic with two years of insomnia which started after his retirement. The patient felt difficulty with falling asleep every night. He underwent a sleep study and was found to have sleep-disordered breathing, which responded well to Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy. However, insomnia symptoms persisted and were resistant to multiple medications, including Mirtazapine, Melatonin, and Suvorexant. He was referred for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with minimal to no improvement in his symptoms. Conversely, a one-week Actigraphy recording on Bipap therapy surprisingly revealed an excellent sleep efficiency with near-continuous seven to eight hours of sleep every night. The etiology of chronic insomnia is poorly understood but is typically multifactorial, as described in the second edition of ICSD. In this case, paradoxical insomnia played a significant role in the patient's clinical presentation. Paradoxical insomnia is defined as thoughts or perceptions of time asleep as wakefulness, with objective measures documenting normative amounts of sleep. Previous work suggests that alterations in the sleep/arousal system may contribute to this apparent mismatch between conventional objective sleep measures and subjective reports. Conclusion This case demonstrates the challenge of effectively diagnosing and managing chronic insomnia. While the new classification guidelines from the ICSD appropriately remove insomnia subtypes from the diagnostic paradigm, familiarity with these previously described subtypes may aid clinical decisions. Crucial to this discussion is that previously described \"secondary\" or \"subtypes\" of primary insomnia may develop an independent clinical course that may require further attention. Support (If Any) ICSD 2nd,3rd editions.",

      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of corresponding external sound(s). Tinnitus can be perceived in one or both ears or in the head. It is usually described as an unpleasant noise, but in some patients it takes the form of a ringing, buzzing, hissing, humming, or whistling sound, or as ticking, clicking, roaring, tunes, songs, or beeping. It is estimated that 1 out of every 5 people experience some degree of tinnitus. Tinnitus is not itself a disease but an unwelcome symptom. It can be accompanied by audiometric evidence of deafness which occurs in association with both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss resulting from a range of underlying causes, including ear infections, foreign objects orwax in the ear, and injury from loud noises. Tinnitus is also a side-effect of some metabolic disorders, medications, and may also result from an abnormally low level of serotonin or high level of insulin. As mentioned above, some foods are found by some people to make their tinnitus worse. The inner ear, like the brain, is totally lacking in energy reserves. Its metabolism depends directly on the supply of oxygen and glucose from the blood supply. Alterations in glucose metabolism therefore have great potential for disturbing the workings of the inner ear. Because tinnitus is often defined as a subjective phenomenon, it is difficult to measure using objective tests. Although there is no specific cure for tinnitus, those affected can learn techniques to successfully manage their tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a problem for them.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion.

Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded.

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders have been frequently reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, there is insufficient evidence to guide precise recommendations on some diagnostic and treatment strategies. Here, we review clinical studies dealing with sleep abnormalities in PD and present clinical recommendations. Previous studies describing insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, narcolepsy-like episodes, circadian changes, sleep-disordered breathing, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, vivid dreams and restless legs syndrome are evaluated. Longitudinal studies associating sleep disorders with PD onset or clinical deterioration are rare: only one longitudinal study associated daytime sleepiness with PD onset. Evidence suggests that clinical investigations must include direct questioning about depressive symptoms, nocturnal cramps, pain, nocturia and nighttime off periods. A patient interview must be conducted regarding sleep symptoms, including nightmares, abnormal behavior during sleep, snoring, restless legs syndrome and daytime sleepiness. Initial evidence indicates that light therapy improves motor function and depression. Advice on sleep hygiene, the treatment of concomitant depression and the careful use of dopaminergic drugs and hypnosedative agents should be considered. To date, very few controlled studies are available to make a recommendation for the management of sleep-wake disturbances in PD.",

According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3), narcolepsy is typically associated with cataplexy and/or other REM sleep phenomena such as hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Narcolepsy is not an uncommon disorder, but is under-recognized. The age of onset shows two peaks of presentation: in childhood and in adults. Both genetics and environmental factors may be involved in the development of narcolepsy. The history, combined with polysomnography and MSLT, remain the current gold standard in the diagnosis of narcolepsy. The levels of Hypocretin-1 are undetectable in the cerebrospinal fluid in most patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy. Early recognition and treatment can greatly improve the quality of life of patients with narcolepsy.

La survenue d'une insuffisance respiratoire est en general progressive et insidieuse. Son diagnostic repose sur des examens cliniques et para-cliniques. Pour la plupart de ces pathologies, il n’existe aucun traitement curatif. Seule la ventilation mecanique associee a une prise en charge cardiaque adaptee permet, pour certaines pathologies, une survie prolongee avec une qualite de vie satisfaisante.

Les criteres d'indication retenus sont l’existence d’au moins un signe clinique evoquant une atteinte respiratoire, associee a une PaCO2 > 45 mmgH ou a une CV < 50% ou a une desaturation nocturne. Toutefois ces indications sont a nuancer en fonction de la pathologie et de la clinique.

We report on an unexpected finding of CSWS in an 18-month-old male whose previous EEG at age 45 days was grossly abnormal with the presence of a burst suppression pattern during wakefulness and sleep. The patient had clinical seizures beginning day 1 of life leading to the suspicion of Ohtahara syndrome (the earliest form of epileptic encephalopathy). Patients with ESES usually have normal EEGs and functional development prior to the onset of CSWS pattern. To our knowledge, this presentation of a neonate with a history of neonatal seizures and developmental delay with an evolution to CSWS has not been described.

Animal models have demonstrated abolition of rapid eye movement atonia, resulting in dream-enacting complex movements termed<i>oneiric behavior</i>, and patients with fatal familial insomnia may have vivid dreams that intrude on wakefulness. <h3>Objective</h3> To describe a new form of progressive dementia with hypersomnia and oneiric behavior. <h3>Methods</h3> Neuropsychological and polysomnographic studies of a middle-aged woman with a progressive dementia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and a vertical gaze palsy. <h3>Results</h3> Neuropsychological testing revealed decreased verbal fluency, impaired attention and working memory, amnesia, poor recall, and bradyphrenia with hypersomnia. Polysomnography revealed a rapid eye movement behavioral disorder with complete absence of slow wave sleep. Prion protein analysis did not reveal the mutation associated with fatal familial insomnia, and other diagnostic test findings were unrevealing. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Our patient had a previously unreported syndrome of progressive dementia associated with rapid eye movement behavioral disorder and the absence of slow wave sleep.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The issue of what constitutes a child or adolescent mental health problem is difficult to determine. Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "title": "To sleep or not to sleep",
      "abstract": "Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep: seems like this should be an easy fix. We have medications to treat almost everything today; insomnia should be no different. Walk into any pharmacy or retail shop and you are likely to find multiple items that claim to provide a refreshing night's sleep with very little by way of adverse effects. There should be no reason to suffer. Wake up refreshed, get those eight hours of sleep, and all with just one simple pill. Now, imagine you are an older adult or a provider attempting to treat an older adult with this same problem. You pull the guidelines, you review the medications, and you discover that most medications are either contraindicated or not recommended for use in the elderly or older population. What are you supposed to do? Why is this so confusing? What can I do? What do I offer the patient? Insomnia occurs frequently in the elderly, with prevalence rates as high as 42% – and higher in those with poor health and those who are on medication therapy.1 Insomnia can also have a negative effect on quality of life, and be associated with anxiety and depression. In addition, insomnia may lead to an increased risk of falls in the elderly.1 With such a high prevalence, why are there not more research undertakings in this area, or effective treatment options? The first problem is that many healthcare providers often allow insomnia to go unrecognised. They do not ask questions regarding sleep patterns, likely due to time restraints, and they may not consider it to be an important or serious medical issue. Second, healthcare providers may not be trained in the non-pharmacological treatment options, which are essentially the only treatment available. Finally, if healthcare providers do feel comfortable prescribing medications, the fear of adverse events can limit their use. Recent updates to guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of insomnia in adults were developed by the American College of Physicians in 20162 and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) in 2017.3 However, the most specific treatment guidelines for the treatment of insomnia in the elderly were published in 2009.1 With so many new medications and advances in insomnia, updates to these guidelines need to be written. The guideline authors recommend all adult patients should receive cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder.1 It should be noted, the first hard stop is then presented: CBT-I is not an appropriate choice for patients with dementia who are unable to actively or meaningfully participate during treatment sessions, thus leaving this treatment option unavailable for many older adults. If medications are chosen as a treatment method, the confusion further sets in. The AASM practice guidelines recommend specific drug therapy for adults with chronic insomnia based on evidence-based analyses.3 The guidelines suggest triazolam, temazepam, eszopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem, ramelteon or suvorexant. The guideline authors recommend against the use of diphenhydramine, melatonin (2-mg dose), tiagabine, trazodone, l-tryptophan and valerian.3 In addition, these guidelines were based on studies that excluded patients with comorbidities, which is troubling because so many older adults have multiple comorbidities. From a provider perspective, these recommendations are also troubling because, as you read the newly updated Beers Criteria, you find that benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics should be avoided in the older adult population.4 Again, many of the first- and second-line treatment options are eliminated in our older adult population. At this point, I may raise my arms in surrender. On a brighter note, the Beers Criteria did not include low-dose (<6 mg) doxepin, melatonin or melatonin-receptor agonists as inappropriate choices in older adults.4 These few options are not the best choices, but at least they are choices. With insomnia as common as it is in the older adult, unique guidelines to address the clinical concerns of these patients are needed. Unfortunately, there is a lack of up to date guidelines. The use of non-pharmacological management should be trialled for all older adults who present with insomnia, and medications could be considered, with use of the lowest possible dosage for the shortest duration. Hypnotics should only be initiated on an as-needed basis in combination with other non-pharmacological treatment options. The provider should remember to take into account symptom patterns, treatment goals, patient preference, cost, comorbid conditions, contraindications, concurrent potential medication interactions and side effects. Finally, more research and discussion surrounding appropriate treatment options are desperately needed. The author declares that she has no conflicts of interest.",

The Center for Disease Control has recently called sleep insufficiency \"a public health epidemic\" and many sleep researchers suggest that sleep deprivation is becoming increasingly common. Sleep deprivation results from getting insufficient high-quality sleep, which can be a result of sleep curtailment. It can also be a result of having poor sleep quality. In terms of performance, both chronic and acute sleep deprivation lead to cognitive slowing and impairments in attention and working memory capacity. Sleep has important consequences for people's performance, safety, health, and well-being. Although little is known about causes of sleep insufficiency in the general population, research suggests that there is a strong association between self-control and sleep. After getting insufficient sleep, many people may recognize being depleted: feeling less capable of completing their work, failing to inhibit the urge to snap at their loved ones, or being unable to resist eating sugary snacks.",

A small subgroup of infants develop apnea and cyanosis accompanied by posturing of the limbs, deviation of the eyes, or opisthotonos, which leads to the incorrect diagnosis of epilepsy. Breathholding spells and pallid infantile syncope, common in infants and young children, may also be mistaken for epileptic attacks. The parasomnias, including pavor nocturnus and somnambulism, are frequently mistaken for epilepsy, since these nocturnal episodes are paroxysmal in nature, may be associated with automatic behavioral mannerisms, and tend to be recurrent. Migraine is especially difficult to differentiate from epilepsy because its manifestations, particularly in children, are so diverse. Other disorders that may superficially mimic epilepsy include transient ischemic attacks, syncope, and transient global amnesia.",

This article summarizes a century of sleep research to examine the maladies of dreaming, their pathophysiologic significance, and management.Under healthy physiologic conditions, REM sleep is characterized by vivid mentation combined with skeletal muscle paralysis. The loss of REM sleep atonia in RBD results in vivid, potentially injurious dream enactment to patients and bed partners. RBD is common, affecting at least 1% of the population and is primarily caused by α-synuclein pathology of REM sleep-related brainstem neurons. The majority of patients with RBD ultimately develop a neurodegenerative syndrome such as Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. Among patients with Parkinson disease, RBD predicts an aggressive disease course with rapid cognitive, motor, and autonomic decline. RBD is diagnosed by the presence of dream enactment episodes (either recorded or clinically recalled) and physiologic evidence of REM sleep without atonia demonstrated on polysomnography. Bedroom safety is of paramount importance in the management of RBD while pharmacokinetic options include melatonin or clonazepam.The injurious dream enactment of RBD is common and treatable. It is a syndrome of α-synuclein pathology with most patients ultimately developing Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or a related disorder.",

The basis treatment of childhood insomnia is behavioral therapy, which includes sleep hygiene, age-appropriate daily routine and sleep associations, stable bedtime routines, positive reinforcement, bedtime fading, scheduled awakenings. Although a systematic ignoring («crying it out») is effective and widely used in behavioral therapy, it has low compliance and its safety is insufficiently studied. Therefore, a systematic ignoring is not a priority method of behavioral therapy and should not be used in children under 6 months of age. Behavioral therapy of childhood insomnia is complemented by psychological and informational support from parents, and in some cases, drug therapy. Prevention includes education of expectant parents on baby sleep hygiene.Поведенческая инсомния — наиболее распространенное нарушение сна у детей раннего возраста, существенно снижающее качество жизни их семей и являющееся одной из частых причин обращения к педиатру или неврологу.

Хотя методы игнорирования плача широко применяются в лечении поведенческой инсомнии и являются эффективными, из-за низкой комплаентности и недостаточно изученной безопасности они не являются приоритетными и не должны использоваться у детей младше 6 мес.

Ultimately, it results in global hypoperfusion and a resulting increase in anaerobic respiration causing lactic acidosis. Maintaining adequate oxygen delivery in the critical care setting is of primary importance in the management of a critically ill patient. When oxygen supply is inadequate, the body undergoes several physiological changes to maintain the oxygen delivery requirements and perfusion pressure. This stage is referred to as compensated shock, and early signs of shock may be appreciated during this stage. When compensatory mechanisms are inadequate and DO2 begins to fall beyond the critical point, shock has progressed to the uncompensated stage. During this stage, there is rapid deterioration of the patient due to prolonged hypoxia and anaerobic respiration. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) is the development of potentially reversible physiological derangement involving two or more organ systems not involved in the causative disorder, which results in persisting states of shock, sepsis and hypoperfusion and a major cause of high mortality in the intensive care unit reaching a range of 11–54% in septic pediatric patients. The final stage of shock is irreversible shock, which is also referred to as refractory shock. This final stage of shock carries a 96–99% mortality rate.",

Frequent nighttime awakening and sleep disruption are the most common sleep problems in Parkinson's disease. Dopamine plays an important role in maintaining wakefulness. To improve sleep in Parkinson's disease, it is important to achieve the critical balance of adequate dopaminergic therapy and control of symptoms. Increased dopaminergic agents can cause dyskinesias and painful dystonia, and undertreatment can cause nighttime akinesia, rigidity, and worse quality of sleep. Other nondopaminergic drugs commonly used in Parkinson's disease can also affect sleep.

Dysmenorrhea can be related to conscious or unconscious rejection of the role of woman or mother. It is treated by psychotherapy. The sexual problems that are relieved easily by physical techniques or education are minor, while those deep in the personality and sustained by psychological mechanisms are major.

      "title": "Contemporary treatment neuropathic pain",
      "abstract": "Introduction. Neuropathic pain, or pain associated with disease or injury to the peripheral or central nervous system, is a common symptom of a heterogeneous group of conditions, including diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, postherpetic neuralgia and spinal cord injury. Chronic neuropathic pain should not be thought of as a symptom. It should truly be thought of as a disease with a very complicated pathophysiology. Pathophysiology. The mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain are complex and involve both peripheral and central pathophysiologic phenomenon. The underlying dysfunction may involve deafferentation within the peripheral nervous system (e.g. neuropathy), deafferentation within the central nervous system (e.g. post-thalamic stroke) or an imbalance between the two (e.g. phantom limb pain). Clinical characteristics. Neuropathic pain is non-nociceptive, in contrast to acute nociceptive pain, and it can be described as ?burning?, ?electric?, ?tingling?, and ?shooting? in nature. Treatment. Rational polypharmacy is often necessary and actually it is almost always the rule. It would be an exception if a patient was completely satisfied with his treatment. Treatment goals should include understanding that our patients may need to be titrated and managed with more than one agent and one type of treatment. There should be the balance of safety, efficacy, and tolerability. Conclusion. There are many new agents and new applications of the existing agents being currently studied which will most certainly lead to even more improved ways of managing this very complicated set of disorders.",

      "title": "1226 Shift Workers Acting Out? A Case of Shift Work Sleep Disorder Causing REM Behavior Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD) is the manifestation of dream enactment with the failure of muscle atonia during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Shift work sleep disorder presents as sleep disruption and/or excessive sleepiness due to an atypical work schedule. Here we show a unique case of RBD provoked by a longstanding history of shift work sleep disorder. Report of case(s) 67-year-old male with shift work sleep disorder, hypertension, and depression who presented for evaluation of RBD. Patient recently retired as a night shift worker and was taking melatonin and citalopram for more than 20 years. For the past several months, the patient has been having episodes of acting out his dreams, such as punching his wife if he was dreaming about punching someone in his sleep. Patient’s polysomnography showed REM sleep without atonia (RWA) in the chin and limb leads with 30% of the 30-s epochs having chin EMG activity with bilateral flexor digitorum superficialis (FDA) phasic EMG activity. Patient’s melatonin dose was increased and he was also started on benzodiazepine with control of his symptoms. Conclusion The common risk factors of RBD include Parkinson’s Disease, occupational toxin exposure, antidepressants, psychological stress (PTSD), or compromised health conditions (such as smoking or cardiovascular diseases). The patient has a chronic use of citalopram but antidepressant-induced RBD usually presents in the fourth/fifth decade of life. A review of literature indicates no cases of shift work disorder causing RBD. However, disruptions in the circadian rhythm put shift workers at an increased risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and psychological disorders, all exposures for RBD. Patient developed shift work sleep disorder causing sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia with a disturbance in the circadian rhythm, ultimately leading to an increased risk for developing RBD. Treatment for RBD includes melatonin as the first-line treatment with addition of low-dose clonazepam or cholinergic agents. With the increasing prevalence of shift work, it is imperative to understand the risks of shift work and identify sleep disorders that may arise, such as RBD, through more research.

Of course, stress and sleep are linked in children too – relevant stressors documented in previous research include separations from key figures (e.g. parents, siblings, friends) as well as rarer events such as inhabiting war-zones (for a review, see Sadeh, 1996).\r\n\r\nWhile it is clear that stressful events and poor sleep can occur at the same time, what is less clear is whether stress experienced early in life is linked to sleep difficulties later on.

      "abstract": "Polyneuropathies can be classified according to etiology, symptoms, time course, and prognosis. Peripheral nerves contain motor, sensory, and autonomic fibers. Composite functions depend on their integrity. The evaluation of individual functions is often difficult, because different types of neuropathies require measurement with different scales and scores. Even for similar types of neuropathies, a variety of scales are used. Contrary to mononeuropathies, where the steps of recovery and the influence of rehabilitation have been well studied, concepts for neurorehabilitation of neuropathies are vague. Analogous to the concepts used in mononeuropathies, (1) reversibility similar to neurapraxia, (2) reinnervation after complete or partial lesions, or (3) permanent loss of peripheral nerve function, with or without progression, are seen. Prior to rehabilitation, a careful analysis of motor, sensory, autonomic, and composite functions, as well as additional features such as pain, gait, and posture and secondary effects such as ulcers or bone deformity, quality of life, psychological aspects, communication, fatigue, and social context, is essential. Recent years have shown increasing awareness of neuroplasticity as a central mechanism to compensate for peripheral deficits. Injury to peripheral nerves triggers an acute mechanism that alters maps at multiple subcortical and cortical levels. Selective amplification of neuroplasticity could be a future aspect of neurorehabilitation.",

Abstract This review synthesizes some of the most current investigative research to illuminate the physiological mechanisms contributing to the relationship between sleep dysfunction and depression. Major depression has consistently been linked to sleep abnormalities and insomnia is a robust risk factor in the initiating and development of depression. Recent neurobiological findings indicate the crucial role of sleep in the affective modulation of brain functioning. Studies have demonstrated that sleep in major depression is characterized by a reduction in slow wave sleep, interruptions in sleep continuity, longer periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep including a shortening of REM latency (i.e. the time between sleep onset and the occurrence of the first REM period), as well as an increase in REM density. The failure of sleep dependant emotional brain processing in REM sleep that seems to occur in depression, support the development and fostering of clinical depression. How depression likely interplays with these sleep processes points to the use of multi-therapeutic approaches for treatment with emphasis on positive behavioural imagery therapies.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

      "title": "Restless legs syndrome--relevant aspects for internal medicine specialists.",
      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Ekbom's syndrome, is a fairly common complaint which is not widely recognised by medical professionals, although it seems to affect 1-10% of the population. Despite recent attempts to better characterize RLS, this neurologic disorder remains poorly understood. Idiopathic RLS frequently follows an autosomal dominant inheritance with a variable clinical expressivity of symptoms. Secondary RLS is usually associated with neuropathy of chronic disorders (uremia, cryoglobulinemia, diabetes mellitus, infections, etc). RLS gives the sufferer an unpleasant sensation in the legs at rest, causing an irresistible desire to move which alleviates the discomfort. Other features that characterize RLS include sleep disturbance, involuntary movements in sleep or wakefulness, a normal neurologic examination, a chronic clinical course (waxing and waning over the time), and, in some cases, a positive family history. Periodic limb movements during sleep, which also may occur as an isolated finding, may or may not cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Clinical diagnosis of idiopathic or symptomatic forms of RLS can be supported with polysomnography. Full understanding of the features of RLS will provide the clinician with the strongest tool for recognizing the disorder. Many different treatments have been tried for RLS. Since the cause is unclear, therapy of RLS and PLMS remains symptomatic except for some secondary forms. Treatment of first choice consists of dopaminergic drugs or dopamine agonist, opioids and benzodiazepines.",

İnsan yaşamının üçte birini kapsayan bu karmaşık fizyolojik süreç, dolaşım, solunum, kas-iskelet ve merkezi sinir sistemi birçok sistemin sağlıklı bir şekilde işlemesinde önemli bir role sahiptir. Bireylerin sağlığını etkilediği gibi yaşam kalitelerini de etkileyen önemli bir olaydır. Uyku kalitesi ise bireylerin kendilerini zihinsel ve bedensel olarak iyi hissetmesidir. Uyku kalitesi kronik hastalık varlığı, stres, yaşam stili, çevresel faktörler, ekonomik durum, iş ve sosyal yaşam gibi birçok faktörden etkilenmektedir. Özellikle psikolojik stres ve uyku sorunları birbirleriyle çift yönlü bir ilişkiye sahiptir. Stres faktörleri uyku kalitesini etkilerken, uyku kalitesinin düşük olması da psikolojik semptomları kötüleştirebilir. İnfertilite tanı ve tedavi sürecinde uyku sorunlarının meydana geldiği yapılan çalışmalar ile gösterilmiştir. Bu sürecin getirdiği psikolojik sıkıntılar ve stres nedeniyle uyku süresinde kısalma, uyku verimliliğinde azalma ve uykunun sık sık bölünmesi gibi sorunlar meydana gelmektedir. Ancak yapılan çalışmalarda infertil bireylerde somatik semptomlar ve psikolojik sıkıntılara değinilmiş olsa da uyku sorunları yeteri kadar incelenmemiş bir konudur. Bu derlemenin amacı infertil bireylerde tanı ve tedavi sürecinin uyku kalitesine olan etkilerini incelemek ve infertilite ünitelerinde çalışan hemşirelerin ve diğer sağlık profesyonellerinin bu konudaki farkındalıklarının artmasını sağlamaktır.",

      "title": "Relationship between Sleep Quality and Cognitive Function in Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in middle-aged and elderly people. PD is characterized by resting tremor, myotonia, bradykinesia, abnormal posture, and gait. The incident of PD increases with age. In addition to motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms have raised additional concerns in recent years. Cognitive impairment is very common in PD patients. It is estimated that the incidence of PD mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is 20–50%,[1] which is present at the initial visit in some patients and a great number of patients with PD-MCI eventually develop PD with dementia (PDD). PD patients are much more likely to develop dementia than the normal population. It has been found that 2/3 of PD patients suffer from different forms of sleep disorders, which are indicated to be one of the common nonmotor symptoms in PD patients. The symptoms of various sleep disorders in PD patients include night insomnia, increased sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, reduced sleep efficiency, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, thus having a serious impact on the patient's sleep quality and increasing the risk of dementia.[2] Therefore, cognitive dysfunction and sleep disorders are two important nonmotor symptoms of PD, exerting greater impacts on the quality of life (QOL). Here, we evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and cognitive function of PD patients. From May 2016 to May 2017, we enrolled a total of 111 native Chinese patients with primary PD and without audiovisual dysfunction who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, the First Hospital of Hebei Medical University. The diagnosis of PD was based on the criteria of the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank. Moreover, the diagnosis of PDD conformed to the diagnostic criteria of dementia proposed by the Movement Disorder Society Task Force: (1) diagnosis of primary PD, (2) PD-related cognitive decline by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), (3) cognitive impairment that affected the patient's daily life ability, and (4) development of extrapyramidal system of PD before dementia, with regular time interval. Patient information was collected by two trained neurologists, including name, sex, age, duration of illness, and educational level. Of these, duration of disease was calculated from the time the patient initially complained of discomfort. The assessment was performed since medications were initiated. The Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) was used to assess the severity of the disease, and Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) staging was utilized for disease rating. According to the severity, the patients were divided into stage 1.0–5.0, including mild (1.0–2.0), moderate (2.5–3.0), and severe (4.0–5.0). According to complaints of patients and their family concerning declined cognitive function and interference with daily life activities in our study, PD patients were divided into three groups as follows: normal group, MCI group, and dementia group, according to MMSE and MoCA (Beijing version) normal cognitive function. MoCA ≥26 points and denying cognitive decline was categorized as a normal cognitive function, MoCA <26 points and MMSE ≥26 as well as a complaint of decreased cognitive function but denying interference with daily life activities as MCI, and MMSE <26 and complaint of decreased cognitive function and affected daily lives as dementia. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate the quality of sleep in PD patients over the pastmonth. Patients with PSQI score ≥6 points were classified as suffering sleep disorders, and patients with long-term use of sleeping pills were excluded. SPSS version 19.0 software (SPSS, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Student's t-test was used for the comparisons. The significance level was set at a value of P < 0.05. There were a total of 111 (61 males and 50 females) PD patients, with a mean age of 66.5 ± 8.7 years, a mean educational level of 11.2 ± 3.5 years and a mean duration of 6.1 ± 4.1 years. The mean H-Y staging was 2.20 ± 0.80, which was classified as mild-to-moderate PD, including mild in 59 (53.15%) patients, and moderate in 52 (46.85%) patients. Patients with PSQI ≥6 were diagnosed with having sleep disorders. There were 67 (60.36%) patients with cognitive impairment, including 30 (27.03%) with MCI and 37 (33.33%) with dementia. The MMSE score in dementia group was 23.04 ± 1.73, which was categorized as mild dementia. The results of the comparison of sleep quality in PD patients with different cognitive levels showed different sleep quality in mild PD patients with different cognitive levels, with the poorest sleep quality in the dementia group. Pairwise comparison showed that the PSQI score was significantly higher in the dementia group than in the normal group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) [Supplementary Table 1]. Different cognitive levels in moderate PD patients were associated with different sleep quality, with the poorest quality in the dementia group. The pairwise comparison indicated significantly higher PSQI scores in dementia group than in the normal group (P < 0.01) [Supplementary Table 2]. Regarding sleep quality, no significant differences were noted in mild and moderate PD patients (P = 0.935).Supplementary Table 1: Comparison of sleep quality in mild Parkinson's disease patients with different cognitive levelsSupplementary Table 2: Comparison of sleep quality in moderate Parkinson's disease patients with different cognitive levelsWith respect to general information in PD patients with different sleep quality, there was no significant difference between the two PD groups regarding age, educational level, duration of disease, and H-Y staging (P > 0.05). However, UPDRS score was significantly higher in the sleep disturbance group than in the normal group, whereas MoCA score and MMSE score were remarkably lower than those in the normal group (both P < 0.05) [Table 1]. The correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between cognitive level and sleep quality in PD patients after controlling H-Y variables (r = 0.461, P < 0.01).Table 1: Comparison of general information in Parkinson's disease patients with different sleep conditionsPD is a common degenerative disease of CNS in the elderly. In addition to motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms in recent years, such as cognitive decline, sleep disorders, autonomic nerve damage, anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, seriously affect the QOL of patients, thereby raising additional concerns. A considerable number of people experience decreased sleep quality at the onset of early PD or before PD symptoms. Common types of sleep disorders in PD patients include difficulty falling asleep, wakefulness/sleep fragmentation, daytime lethargy, sleep-deprivation, REM sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep episodes. In addition, altered sleep parameters have been observed, including sleep structure. Those are confronted with unapparent difficulties of falling asleep, difficulties of maintaining sleep and disordered sleep structure, higher incidence of asymptomatic periodic limb movements, and REM sleep behavior disorder, adversely impacting patients' QOL. There are studies suggesting that RBD is a risk factor for cognitive impairment in PD patients.[3] As we reported, mean H-Y staging of all 111 patients was 2.20 ± 0.80, showing a mild-to-moderate PD. PQSI scale was used to assess the quality of sleep in 111 PD patients enrolled, indicating the prevalence of 54.95% in sleep disorders. PD sleep disorders have been reported to be associated with aging, the severity of illness, depression, and dopaminergic dose. There is no consensus on the prevalence of sleep disorders in PD patients based on various studies, which is, however, generally higher than our results. Several studies have shown that PD patients suffer abnormal sleep at an early stage, which is likely to worsen as the disease progresses. Even at early stage, PD patients have a significantly decreased health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) compared with their peers, and that PD impacts HR-QOL in various manners. PD at an early stage has a limited effect on HR-QOL due to relatively mild motor symptoms. Thus, the priority should be given to nonmotor symptoms. The authors of the study recognize depression, fatigue, and sleep disorders as the leading cause of the decline in HR-QOL in early PD patients.[4] The current findings reveal that a higher rate (54.95%) of sleep disorders is noted in mild-to-moderate PD patients, and sleep disorders negatively impact cognitive function in PD patients, thereby leading to further decline of HR-QOL. Sleep disorders and cognitive disorders, as the two major nonmotor symptoms of PD, interact with each other. Sleep disorders can be seen as a concomitant symptom of cognitive impairment and can lead to involvement of the brainstem nerve nucleus, thus impairing cognitive function. The current results showed that sleep disorders in PD patients were associated with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and a marked decline in cognitive function. Consistent with the above findings, PD patients with dementia had poorer sleep quality than those with normal cognitive function, suggesting an interaction between sleep quality and cognitive function. Based on studies in the Western countries,[5] α-synuclein, Aβ protein, and tau protein have been found in multiple brain functional areas of PD patients with sleep disorders. Currently, Aβ protein and tau protein are recognized to be associated with pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease.[6] In addition, α-synuclein abnormally aggregates to form Lewy bodies, which are characteristic pathological changes of Lewy body dementia, suggesting a common pathological basis of sleep disorders and cognitive decline. This study has several limitations. First, patients enrolled had mild-to-moderate PD and MCI. Second, there was a small sample size. Third, the effect of medications patients took on sleep is not taken into account. Last, the types of sleep disorders patients suffered were not specified. Patients with severe PD should be included, and larger sample size is needed. In addition, research methods need to be improved to obtain more detailed and accurate data. Conclusively, our findings suggest that sleep disorder in PD patients can be considered as a concomitant symptom of cognitive decline, and further aggravate cognitive impairment, indicating a potential interaction. Although the underlying pathophysiological processes remain incompletely understood, the association between sleep disorders and cognitive function in PD patients may suggest a decrease in dopamine levels in the limbic system.

      "title": "Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations",
      "abstract": "This special issue is devoted to the concept of ESSENCE (Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations). It is an acronym that one of us coined some years ago [1] with a view to highlighting the clinical reality of children (and their parents) presenting in first, second, or third tier clinical settings with, usually complex, impairing developmental symptoms already in early childhood. The children are reported to have problems in the fields of (a) general development, (b) communication and language, (c) social interrelatedness, (d) motor coordination, (e) attention/“listening,” (f) activity, (g) behavior, (h) mood, and/or (i) sleep. Children with major difficulties in one or more (usually several) of these fields will be seen by health visitors, nurses, social workers, education (including preschool) specialists, pediatricians, GPs, speech and language therapists, child neurologists, child psychiatrists, psychologists, neurophysiologists, dentists, clinical geneticists, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists, but, in the vast majority of cases they will be seen only by one of these specialists, when, in fact, they would have needed the input of two or more (occasionally even all) of the “experts” referred to.\r\n\r\nCategorical diagnosis is an integral part of everyday clinical and research practice. We are so insistent on the distinction between disorder and not disorder (normalcy) that clinics and clinicians become more and more specialized and cater to the needs of children with “Autism Spectrum Disorder/ASD only,” “Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder/ADHD only,” “Language Disorder only,” “Reactive Attachment Disorder/RAD only,” or “Tourette syndrome only.” This has led to a situation in which the typical clinical diffuseness of disorder has come to be underestimated.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there is growing acceptance that coexistence of disorders and sharing of symptoms across disorders (so-called comorbidity, a misnomer if ever there was one, seeing as we are usually not dealing with completely separate coexisting disorders) are the rule rather than the exception (e.g., [2]). This was pointed out more than a quarter of a century ago [3], but, in clinical practice, this insight has not led to new approaches when trying to address the needs of children and families with “complex needs.” Instead, diversification has boomed.\r\n\r\nThere are legislational, scientific, and clinical attempts to separate out children with certain disorders/diagnosis; for example, ASD from those who do not meet criteria for the disorder/diagnosis. The goal is usually provide better societal guidelines, more focused attempts at finding the causes, and more specific services. Children with ADHD are targeted in similar ways, even though legislation has yet to catch up with them. The same holds for children with Language Disorder, visual impairments, and hearing deficits (children who may, or may not, have additional impairments as regard to general cognition, motor performance, ADHD, or ASD).\r\n\r\nASD and ADHD, long treated and, believed to be, completely separate and recognizable “disorders,” are now increasingly often diagnosed “together” within the same individual, and there is growing awareness that they sometimes overlap, constitute amalgams of problems, and that in some families they separate together and probably represent different aspects of the same underlying disorder [4].\r\n\r\nThe overlap, shared and nonshared symptoms and etiologies of these named disorders are in focus in this special issue.\r\n\r\nThere are 14 papers altogether in the volume. They deal with a variety of ESSENCE-related issues ranging from maltreatment and RAD (and the difficult issue of how to study the effects of early intervention aiming to stop maltreatment and provide safe and nurturing care), through autism from preschool to adult life (including a study showing that autism diagnosed early in life is always comorbid with other disorders, and a literature review indicating that pain sensitivity is, in fact, not decreased in autism), language delay (which can only be screened for by face-to-face assessment), eating problems (that are shown to be comorbid with ASD and ADHD symptomatology in a very high proportion of cases), and cerebral palsy (in which the prevalence of mental health problems, including ADHD, appears to currently be grossly underestimated) to more general mental health problems (and the use of child psychiatric and school psychology services that is associated with such problems). Methodologies covered in the special issue range from longitudinal population-based screening and clinical assessment studies, through randomized controlled trials and large-scale epidemiological twin research, to position and PRISMA-guideline systematic review papers. There is a wealth of information for clinicians and researchers alike, and it is expected that the issue on ESSENCE will prove to be a landmark in the development of new approaches to screening and intervention for children and adults affected by neurodevelopmental disorders. ESSENCE affect about one in ten individuals across the planet, and we are dealing with a huge public health problem. ESSENCE, from now on, must be given highest priority both in clinical research and practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristopher Gillberg\r\n\r\nElisabeth Fernell\r\n\r\nHelen Minnis",
