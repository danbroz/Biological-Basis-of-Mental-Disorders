Such problems might be analyzed by a psychological well-being proficient, generally a clinical therapist or specialist. The reasons for mental problems are regularly hazy.",

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

The excessive thoughts, feeling or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns are demonstrated through one of three possible avenues.

The occurrence of a medical illness does not eliminate the possibility of Illness Anxiety Disorder. The diagnosis can still be applied if the health-related anxiety and the concerns about the illness are significantly out of proportion. Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s). Pain disorder associated with a general medical condition was not considered to be a mental disorder, because the requirement was not met that psychological factors play an important role.",

The physician should rule out three psychiatric disorders in which unexplained physical symptoms often dominate the clinical picture. These are hysteria, anxiety neurosis, and depression. Each is a definite syndrome with specific diagnostic criteria and a well-documented natural history. Hysteria and anxiety neurosis often can be managed as successfully by an internist or general practitioner as by a psychiatrist. Depression more often justifies a psychiatric referral. \"Functional\" symptoms which cannot be attributed to one of these syndromes often warrant further search for an organic cause.",

There are two broadly different mechanisms. The most obvious has a psychological or cognitive mechanism. Thus, the illness may provide the life event or chronic difficulty that triggers a depressive episode in a vulnerable Individual. Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest. The best examples are probably stroke and cardiovascular disease. Finally major depression, but especially minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms merge with other manifestations of human distress with which patients present to their doctors, Such somatic presentations test the conventional distinction between physical and mental disorder, and are a perennial source of controversy.",

      "abstract": "Psychische Schaeden als Unfallfolgen fuehren oft zum Rechtsstreit. Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis. Unerlaesslich ist eine Pruefung der zeitlichen Abfolge (Folge nach der Ursache), also ob aehnliche Befunde bereits vor dem Unfall bestanden haben. Bei den Stoerungsbildern dissoziative Bewegungsstoerungen und somative Stoerungen koennen durch den Untersucher keine krankhaften Befunde, bei der traumatischen Belastungsstoerung nur spaerliche Befunde erhoben werden.

      "title": "Syndromes of Brain Dysfunction Presenting with Cognitive Impairment or Behavioral Disturbance: Delirium, Dementia, and Mental Disorders Caused by a General Medical Condition",
      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

Intercurrent illnesses sometimes develop in spite of bed rest, as when myocardial infarction occurs during convalescence from a pelvic or orthopedic operation. In most cases the evil effects of complete bed rest are potentiated by anesthesia, narcotics or other medication or by the results of the original illness. But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position. In any discussion of the effects of complete bed rest it is to be borne in mind that the disorders noted may have been aggravated, or even initiated, by a depression",

Stories concerning death produced by continued wakefulness or of mental disease produced by long vigils have been current for many years. There are, however, no actually observed cases recorded in the medical literature which clearly indicate that extended vigils produce either mental disease or death. Normal sleep is disturbed in various organic conditions of the central nervous system, such as encephalitis, meningitis, concussion and dementia paralytica, as well as in the functional psychoses, in manic-depressive psychosis and in schizophrenia.

For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, this notion has been a conspicuous part of the lore of this illness dating back to its earliest clinical descriptions.",

      "abstract": "\"Jail syndrome\" is a condition emerging in individuals of high profile and status facing legal repercussions due to involvement in corruption or other illegal activities. This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of symptoms, including anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosomatic symptoms such as chest pain, headache, hysterical attacks, and many more with minimal positive investigations and other evaluations. Its prevalence is notably high among high-profile individuals such as politicians and bureaucrats in contexts marked by corruption, especially in India. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in response to arrest or legal proceedings, complicating clinical diagnosis due to the lack of identifiable organic causes. Distinguishing jail syndrome from genuine medical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes is crucial for effective management. The syndrome reflects a circumstantial diagnosis influenced by the psychological stress of legal consequences, necessitating a careful assessment of both psychological and physiological health. Large-scale studies, research, and data analysis are essential to validate jail syndrome as a recognized clinical diagnosis. Jail syndrome is a self-explanatory clinical diagnosis to convey the onset of symptomatology, etiopathology, and treatment strategy in a person involved in illicit activities with history of charges, imprisonment, or sentencing to jail. Most important is to rule out organic disease because many times organic causes such as acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HT) are present. Very important is that large-scale data and their scientific analysis are required to confirm and recognize it as a definite clinical diagnosis of \"jail syndrome.\" No doubt the term jail syndrome is self-explanatory and conveys the message we want to convey.",

      "abstract": "It is natural to assume that because a psychosis occurs during the process of childbearing the two events are therefore necessarily associated, but the evidence is conflicting and the relationship between them has not been established with certainty. In fact no immediate dramatic cause has yet been demonstrated that would account for such mental breakdowns, and it would be surprising if it had, for the great majority of psychoses not related to maternity show no simple sequence of cause and effect. Yet it would be wrong to dismiss without further examination an occasion so important in the life of the mother as childbirth as of no aetiological consequence. In the types of psychosis under consideration the clinical onset had often been a sudden and disturbing event, just at that particular time in the patient's life when she was confronted with the responsibility of motherhood. Further examination of the patient's history however often revealed previous evidence of emotional disturbance, or of instability in other members of her family.",

Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw. Verlauf des Pruritus sowie Hinweise zu ihrer jeweiligen Diagnostik Material und Methode Es handelt sich um eine Überblicksarbeit. Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

In the great majority of these instances, however, the external conditions represent only an additional, precipitating aetiological factor which is operating as a trigger mechanism to a mental derangement of non-specific character already present in a latent state. It may therefore be of some theoretical and practical interest to report on a group of acute and subacute psychotic states whose history, features, course and outcome characterize them as constituting a readily recognizable clinical entity of purely psychological, situational origin.",

      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

      "abstract": "Wounds and wound healing are often considered to be purely medical phenomena, but there is growing evidence that the psychological impact on the patient is of equal importance. The psychological consequences of having a wound may include stress, sleep disturbances, negative mood and social isolation. These outcomes may be a result of the physical effects of the wound, such as pain or high levels of exudate. Wound management problems, mobility issues and malodour will also have an impact on the patient’s psychological well-being. These consequences may, in turn, have a profound impact on the healing of a chronic wound and therefore affect an individual’s quality of life.",

Studies on job stress have revealed that lately this problem or condition has greatly affected people who work as workers; since the consequences of suffering stress from work are sufficient, they are also serious and in some cases difficult to manage. Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor. Be very careful, because if it can be avoided they can cause fatal damage to humans or even cause death.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Fatigue Among Female Academicians",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric epidemiology constitutes an important subdiscipline of scientific psychiatry. Nevertheless, it still lags behind other branches of epidemiology. This has been attributed to the difficulties encountered in conceptualising and measuring mental disorders.1 It is only recently that the emphasis in the field has shifted from descriptive to analytical research and this is probably because of the influences from genetic epidemiology and social sciences.2 Psychiatric epidemiology has taken most of its tools from general epidemiology—that is, chronic disease epidemiology.3 It is therefore not surprising that no fundamental differences between the mother discipline and her psychiatric descendant exist. Yet, there are particular challenges in the conduct of psychiatric epidemiological research that are absent or less prominent in general, mostly somatically oriented, epidemiology.4 Challenges particularly encountered in psychiatric epidemiology include\n\n\n\n1. Assessment of caseness: psychiatric diagnoses are mostly made on the basis of symptoms—patients’ reports of their subjective experiences—and not signs, like fever in general medicine. Moreover, there are no pathognomonic symptoms or signs;\n\n2. Neither most mental disorders nor their best-known risk factors, like social deprivation, stress exposure, lack of social support, social isolation, abnormal personality traits or genetic liability, are as easily captured in a singular variable as tends to be the case in the epidemiology of somatic disease;\n\n3. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is costly in time and effort; and\n\n4. Information bias and non-response bias are more of a problem in psychiatric epidemiology than in other branches of epidemiology.\n\n\n\nIn our view, this warrants recognition of the epidemiology subspecialty “psychiatric epidemiology”.\n\nIn trying to cope with the above-mentioned challenges, psychiatric epidemiology has developed a set of concepts, albeit limited, and vocabulary of its own. The purpose of this glossary is to provide brief definitions, sometimes with comments, of frequently used special terms one may come across in dealing with …",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

However, the term “trauma” is actually difficult to define due to its subjective nature.

Examples of such events include military combat, violent personal attack, natural or humanmade disasters, and torture. For children, sexually traumatic events may include ageinappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury (American Psychiatric Association. and American Psychiatric Association.

Secondary dystonia may be further classifi ed into symptomatic dystonia and the dystonia-plus syndromes. Symptomatic dystonia is due to an identifi able brain disease, an obvious brain or peripheral insult, or a hereditary or sporadic degeneration of the brain.

There are no convulsive movements of either tonic or clonic nature during psychomotor seizures. Synonyms for the term psychomotor seizures are epileptic equivalents and epileptic fugue states. Psychomotor seizures occur in late childhood or adult life; they have a frequency approximating that of major convulsions, and the individual attack lasts from one to five or more minutes. On the basis of these clinical facts the differentiation from petit mal epilepsy is not difficult. The activity of the patient during psychomotor seizures is quite distinct.

This dizziness almost always occurs either spontaneously or as a result of certain movements or positions. Examination of the patients usually reveals no clinical signs to explain this complaint of dizziness, and therefore these patients are usually labeled as having some type of neurosis. The most common diagnoses are traumatic neurosis, traumatic hysteria, encephalopathy and traumatic encephalitis—obviously, all diagnoses of embarrassment.

Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status. Failure to distinguish act from status accounts for the wide disparities in definitions of malingering.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

This can also be the case for general medical conditions for both aetiology and differences in structure or process and sometimes lack of useful biomarkers but this occurs to a lesser extent. There are also occasions when medical conditions cause mental health problems directly. For this reason doctors will always be involved in mental health to some degree and will use diagnostic constructs to describe these conditions as they are familiar with diagnosis in their medical practice. There are examples of clear biological abnormalities that are often detected accidentally that do not require treatment. Medically unexplained or functional symptoms/syndromes are commonly seen in general medicine, although the term ‘medically unexplained’ is contentious.

Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

      "abstract": "The affective disorders include a variety of conditions characterised by mood changes unrelated to life events, i.e. they are not reactive. There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

      "abstract": "Serious physical illness naturally leads to emotional disturbance, particularly when the illness is disabling or life-threatening, so it is not surprising that stroke is associated with mood disorder, manifested as an increase either in general levels of distress or in the rate of clinically diagnosable states. In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

Estrictamente hablando, la simulación no es un trastorno mental sino un problema que puede ser objeto de atención clínica. Sin embargo, se presume erróneamente que la simulación podría darse solamente en contextos forenses, lo que dificulta su identificación en ámbitos clínicos. La “psicosis instrumental” es una variante de simulación consistente en el fingimiento de síntomas por parte de un individuo con diagnóstico subyacente de una psicosis primaria y que simula sus síntomas en momentos de estabilidad clínica. Se presentan dos casos de personas con diagnóstico primario de esquizofrenia que pueden ser considerados también como aparentes casos de psicosis instrumental. No existen reportes previos de este trastorno en nuestro país, aunque presumiblemente su número no debe ser exiguo.

Direct functional disturbance of various districts is also suggested, and the pathology of such forms in psychosomatically oriented patients is described. Such orientation takes the form of a ready translation of ideas into rather diffuse somatic changes that are partly aspecific, due to the predominance of response mechanisms that are more physiological than psychological. The picture is one of a primordial reaction to difficulties and problems, coupled with increased stress, sometimes to the points of vegetative or motor storms, in the expectation of help from outside, such help being represented in the past by intervention on the part of the mother.",

Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

Elles correspondent souvent a la survenue d'evenements nouveaux, vecus comme traumatisants. Le deuil, les separations. . . , autant de situations stressantes induisant un malaise que le malade ne peut surmonter. Notons aussi cette problematique relationnelle, avec tout ce qu'elle connote comme ambivalence et tiraillement chez le malade qui n'arrive pas a trouver un compromis, lui permettant de surmonter ses conflits sans crainte de la perte ou de la rupture. La decharge emotionnelle etant barree, l'agressivite si elle existe, demeure retournee sur le malade lui-meme. Le malaise familial que vivent les patients se laisse voir a travers leurs difficultes relationnelles avec l'entourage et la situation embarassante dans laquelle ils se trouvent, sans aucune mediation possible par le langage concernant leurs problemes. Le discours parental culpabilisant fait vivre au patient un sentiment de rejet mal tolere. Il s'ajoute a cela la menace et la malediction qui suscitent l'angoisse. L'angoisse est aussi particulierement aigue devant la mort ou l'atteinte de la personne. Elle s'exprime dans la somatisation, faute de pouvoir etre symbolisee, elaboree dans la relation a l'autre. Le patient semble se retrancher a l'interieur de son propre corps ou moi, sans contact possible avec l'autre trop menacant et il est comme coupe de l'interieur.

Symptoms of grief or bereavement may be characterized by agitation, somatic complaint and social withdrawal. Other situational factors may precipitate maladjustment with depressed mood. Of course, general medical problems inherent to late life are associated with loss of autonomy together with increased chronicity of depression and refractoriness to treatment. Some individuals who are depressed may simply develop failure to thrive. Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease. Subsyndromal depression may also be present or atypical forms of depression including masked depression with sadness or dysphoria; depressive pseudodementia with reversible cognitive impairment, and hypochondriasis or depression with prominent somatic complaints.",

Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long.

Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments.

      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

So ist es einerseits gut bekannt, dass psychische und soziale Faktoren, „Stress“ oder auch eine Depression einen unabhängigen Risikofaktor für das Auftreten von Schlaganfällen darstellen. Umgekehrt ist es aber auch so, dass der Schlaganfall selbst zu tiefgreifenden psychischen Folgen führen kann. Insbesondere die Post-Schlaganfall-Depression spielt hier eine wichtige Rolle. Sie tritt in mindestens 1/3 aller Schlaganfall-Patienten auf und ist mit einem schlechten „Outcome“ sowie einer erhöhten Sterblichkeit assoziiert. Klinische wie experimentelle Untersuchungen aus den letzten Jahren haben zum Verständnis der vielfältigen Beziehungen zwischen Schlaganfall und Psyche beigetragen. Insbesondere die vielversprechenden Ergebnisse der FLAME-Studie, welche eine verbesserte neurologische Erholung bei der frühen Gabe von Antidepressiva bei Schlaganfall-Pa­tienten zeigte, eröffnet nun die klinische Frage, ob Schlaganfall-Patienten generell bereits zu einem frühen Zeitpunkt mit Antidepressiva behandelt werden sollten.",

Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder. The presented data on a global level indicate that in the world and in the Balkan 7.5 % of patients are treated in hospital.

Symptoms of fibromyalgia may not only include pain, but also sleep disorder, fatigue, melancholia, and other mood disorders. Pain is one of the major symptoms of many diseases and may greatly impede the quality and functionof an individual's life. Yet many clinicians have trouble treating chronic pain in part because they focus on the pain itself, which is merely one of the causes, and not on the evaluation and treatment of problems incidental to pain. It is noted that pain may be accompanied by not only physical suffering, but also emotional problems, such as melancholia and other secondary problems. The causes for fibromyalgia syndrome have not yet been clearly revealed but it is known that mental factors contribute to the occurrence and progress of the symptoms, and that the evaluation of or therapeutic interventions for the mental causes may be due to physical effects. Therefore, based on ad-equate psychiatric knowledge, clinicians should under-stand and treat the patients accordingly. It may be that more effective medical services are needed through in-tensive treatments in multidisciplinary teams for the patients. This article is aimed at investigating the psychological issues that fibromyalgia patients encounter. It also considers the psychiatric drugs and psychosocial treatment that are applied to the disease.",

      "abstract": "Hypochondriacal delusions are not bound to a specific mental disorder, but occur in the whole spectrum of psychoses. In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

      "title": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders",
      "abstract": "When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends oh our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms arid that if they “got their act together” the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation. This paper presents a brief review of our current understanding of each diagnosis and gives suggestions for management. Curr Open Pediatr 1999, 11375–378 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",

Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance Irritability The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause",

The classical characteristics of psychosis are impaired reality testing, hallucinations, delusions, and illusions. While factitious disorder and malingering are usually acknowledged as contrived psychiatric conditions for acquisition of interior or exterior profits, respectively, another alternative, also, exists that though is not manufactured individually, is enforced peripherally. Such cases, which are usually referred by the judge’s ruling, for evaluation and treatment, are more important than comparable simulated or genuine mental conditions, because incorrect diagnosis, or careless, cagily, and guarded validation of preliminary diagnosis that has been issued in the authorized or emergency department, can seriously endanger the individual’s civil rights, while it should not be overlooked that incorrect diagnosis is a kind of malpractice that may harm an individual awfully.

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

Planned revisions of diagnostic criteria will not resolve heterogeneity, comorbidity, fuzzy boundaries between normal and pathological, and lack of specific biomarkers. Concern about these difficulties reflects a narrow model that assumes most mental disorders should be defined by their etiologies. A more genuinely medical model uses understanding of normal function to categorize pathologies. For instance, understanding the function of a cough guides the search for problems causing it, and decisions about when it is expressed abnormally. Understanding the functions of emotions is a foundation missing from decisions about emotional disorders. The broader medical model used by the rest of medicine also recognizes syndromes defined by failures of functional systems or failures of feedback control. Such medical syndromes are similar to many mental diagnoses in their multiple causes, blurry boundaries, and nonspecific biomarkers. Dissatisfaction with psychiatric nosology may best be alleviated, not by new diagnostic criteria and categories, but by more realistic acknowledgment of the untidy landscape of mental and other medical disorders.",

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

      "title": "Fall or Shaken: Traumatic Brain Injury in Children Caused by Falls or Abuse at Home - A Review on Biomechanics and Diagnosis",
      "abstract": "In cases of traumatic brain injuries in children it may be difficult to differentiate between physical abuse and accidental occurrence. This review will shed light on discriminating epidemiological as well as biomechanical data, morphological findings, and clinical features. As a basic principle, simple injuries are caused by simple mechanisms like falls whereas life-threatening injuries should be attributed to abuse until proven otherwise. Implausibilities between reported events and mechanisms by caregivers as well as more than one explanation of injury indicate suspicion of child abuse. From reviewing the literature, it can be stated that falls from less than 1.5 m lead only in few cases to severe brain injuries. Children who experienced a fall at home seldom exhibit fractures of the skull but just minor intracranial injuries without neurological deficits. Regarding biomechanical aspects, multiple or complex skull fractures, depression fractures, additional fractures of the body, and intracranial hemorrhages as a consequence of an impact are the most important findings in child abuse. Moreover, additional specific morphological criteria give evidence of clinical and/or post-mortem diagnosis of the shaken baby syndrome. These include subdural hemorrhage and laceration of the brain and retinal bleeding, epidural hemorrhage of the cervical cord, gripping marks (bruises) on chest and/or shoulders, and tearing injuries of the throat and neck muscles. Post-mortem signs of recurrent shaken baby syndrome are indicated by iron-positive cells or microglial cells in neuronal or retinal tissue. A clinical diagnosis will be dependent on the one hand on the exclusion of coagulation diseases, on the other hand on the demonstration of a subdural hemorrhage by means of neuroimaging techniques, i.e., CT and MRI, as well as retinal hemorrhage. The shaken baby syndrome will usually be observed within the first year of life. The doctor has to manifest his diagnosis to the caregivers and - before informing the caregivers - he must be sure of his diagnosis.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "abstract": "Although the majority of epileptics who are well controlled on medication do not show significant evidence of psychopathology, a subset of epileptics have serious psychiatric disturbances. Risk factors for the development of psychopathology appear to include poorly-controlled seizures, a long duration of seizure disorder with onset in childhood, seizure focus in the temporal lobe, bilateral or multiple discharges on EEG, and structural lesions. All of these factors appear to put the patient at greater risk of brain dysfunction, possibly because of the disruption of limbic functions associated with behavior and personality. The onset of seizures in childhood is likely to affect the development of personality and social functioning adversely. Although not a focus of this article, premorbid personality, psychologic reactions to having epilepsy, and the social problems accompanying the disease are likely to contribute greatly to the development of psychopathology. The development of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy thus appears to be a complex, multifactorial process. No single factor, such as seizure type, EEG findings, lateralization, pathology, or demographic variables is likely to be explanatory. Recent research has focused on accounting for many of these factors, and future investigations should shed further light on why some epileptics develop psychiatric problems and how best to treat these disorders.",

      "abstract": "Excited delirium syndrome (ExDS) has been defined as the sudden death of an individual involving an acute (minutes to hours) transient disturbance in consciousness and cognition, marked by disorientation, disorganized and inconsistent thought processes, inability to distinguish reality from hallucinations, disturbances in speech, disorientation to time and place, and misidentification of individuals. 1 In a majority of these deaths the individual exhibited violent behaviors, struggled with police, correction officers, or medical personnel during control and physical restraint of the person, within a matter of several minutes after the cessation of the struggle the person is observed to be in cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation is usually unsuccessful.Frequently an autopsy does not reveal anatomic evidence to show trauma or natural disease or toxicological findings sufficient to explain the death.Commonly, pathologists cite the symptoms of ExDS on the death certificate as contributing factors of the death. 2-4Deaths associated with ExDS were first reported in a case report in 1849 when psychiatrist Dr. Luther Bell at the McClean Asylum for the Insane in Massachusetts described the condition of 40 mentally ill patients who died from a fatal new disease. 5Common features observed in these patient's deaths included: fever, rapid pulse, increasing confusion, loss of appetite and sleep, mania, and violent behaviors.Patients condition deteriorated over several weeks before dying.The clinical condition was referred to as Bell's Mania or acute exhaustive mania and is considered the forerunner of the syndrome of ExDS. 1,2,4,6Other case reports described similar symptoms of Bell's Mania and were referred to as acute delirious mania, lethal catatonia, acute psychotic furors exhaustive syndrome, and typhoma.As new antipsychotic medications emerged through the 1950s, the incidence of deaths associated with Bell's Mania declined.By the mid-1980s a number of deaths associated with cocaine use were reported by Fishbain and Wetli and they described symptoms associated with chronic stimulant abuse as excited delirium. 7Common factors observed in these deaths included: acute drug intoxication, mental illness, agitation, hyperactivity, violence, bizarre and self-injurious behaviors, hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and elevated body temperature.For years there has been a controversy as to a standardized case definition of ExDS.Case report and post-mortem literature since the 1990s has shown that ExDS comprises several clinical features including: delirium with agitation, hyperthermia, violent agitation, acute psychotic behavior, bizarre behaviors, profuse sweating, incoherent speech, extraordinary strength and endurance, lack of response to painful stimuli, hyperactivity, respiratory arrest, and",

      "title": "Some Remarks About Somato-Psychic Compared to Psychosomatic Relationships",
      "abstract": "Somato-psychic medicine refers to all those processes in which psychological phenomena are produced by alterations of the body's anatomy or physiology. It is often extremely difficult to determine the first cause of a psychic disturbance, since somatic influences may produce psychic phenomena, and these in turn may produce somatic processes, and vice versa. These relationships are graphically portrayed for a few well-known clinical pictures. At times it is possible, by analysis of the manifestations presented, to discover evidence of the various influences. Under certain conditions, however, a later process may exert such overwhelming effects in the temporal succession of events that the influence of earlier factors may not be manifest in the clinical picture. A simple classification of the various somato-psychic influences in three groups is presented for better visualization. The first group is comprised of processes taking place within the confines of the skull. The second is represented by those disease processes that are anatomically located extracranially but where changed metabolites or other agents exert influence on the brain cells with subsequent psychic signs. Drugs and other substances brought from outside into the body and exerting influence on the brain may be regarded as a subgroup of factors belonging to this second group. The third group comprises psychic processes that represent conscious or unconscious reactions by the individuals to somatic diseases or to permanent bodily conditions. The correlation of somatic abnormalities and psychological disturbance is, of course, not exhausted by psychosomatic and somato-psychic relationships, since a certain body build and a particular psychological make-up may be expressions of the same constitution.",

They may represent different areas of a spectrum of illness/condition and/or be part of a spectrum of illnesses/conditions. However, they share both these characteristics with many general medical diagnostic constructs. For spectrums of illness/condition this may be because there are no natural boundaries but that it is important or seems obvious to recognize different areas of the spectrum for reasons of clinical utility (such as different prognostic implications or treatments) or different clinical pictures. For spectrums of illnesses/conditions the reason for co-occurrence may be because different diagnostic constructs have similar causes/mechanisms. On the other hand, these problems of lack of boundaries are not present as commonly in general medical diagnostic constructs. Alternative mental health classifications do not have the same issues with co-occurrence. They may be more useful in research to discover reasons why co-occurrence of symptoms may occur but have pragmatic drawbacks for other classification functions.",

      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

      "title": "Estudio de los síntomas somáticos asociados a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una población de atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY One of the crucial subjects, either for the clinical or scientific activity, is the dimensional or categorical character of depression and other mental diseases. Each approach is different from the theoretical and epistemological points of view. At presence, the categorical model for the definition and estimation of the presence of a disorder are reflected in the data on epidemiology, the results of investigations, instruments and the interventions. These elements are related to a system of thinking which results in a particular form of conceiving the psychopathology and intervention. Nevertheless, the strong influence of the categorical model in which the disorders are defined as a group of accomplished criteria has not prevented from development of a dimensional model. The latter postulates the existence of a continuum between the normality and pathology which correspond with dimensions, levels and severity related to the certain behaviours, traits or even symptoms. The interest in the dimensional approach to psychopathology, in general and in mood disorders, is caused by the observation in clinics which indicate, for example, that many patients do not improve with medicines and present residual symptoms during long periods of time. For these reasons, some personality factors which would explain the chronic symptoms of disorders have been proposed in Psychology and Psychiatry. Although the diagnostic manuals consider different types of mood disorders, many investigations have showed the possibility to consider depression as a continuum, where the least severe extreme would be the depressive personality and the most severe, major depression. According to the abovementioned proposal, it is possible that some people present certain vulnerability which would explain the different answers in case of depression. Cognitive factors, together with social and genetic factors increase the risk of chronic depressive symptoms. The catastrophic perception of self, the world and future, the dichotomous thinking and tunnel vision are the cognitive factors associated with the presence of the mood disorders symptoms. Additionally, some studies show the importance of gender, as women are more prone to develop depression and similar disorders which is related to traditional social roles. This can be caused by the need to sacrifice the professional career to dedicate time to housework, or to assume multiple roles. Concerning the genetic factors, the presence of first degree relatives with mood disorders increases the risk of development of depression or dysthymia. The consideration of depressive personality is based on the presence of symptoms which do not fulfil the criteria of severity and frequency of major depression but do affect the mood. The presence of these stable traits is related to major chronicity and worse prognosis. This condition has been described in manuals as dysthymia. Nevertheless, as it remains relatively stable in time it could be understood as a personality disorder. The disorder would be a continuum with the normality similar to this described as neuroticism in which some entities are qualitatively and quantitatively different which represent the categories.",

Medical training is identified as full of stress\r\nand it is also observed that students undergo tremendous stress during various years of medical training. In\r\nmany medical schools, the environment itself is an all prevailing pressure situation, providing an authoritarian\r\nand rigid system, one that encourages competition rather than cooperation between learners . It is not just the\r\nundergraduate study period which brings stress but it may continue during the internship, postgraduate study\r\nperiod, and later into physician's practical life . The stress may also reach burnout levels",

      "title": "Myofascial Pain, Fibromyalgia or Fibrositis?",
      "abstract": "The terms myofascial pain, fibromyalgia and fibrositis are critically examined. They constitute diagnostic labels for non-specific musculoskeletal aches and pains. Analysis of the evidence shows that none of these labels is substantiated by hard physical signs or by laboratory evidence of consistent pathological or biochemical abnormality. What is the objective evidence for disorder(s) of muscle, fascia or fibrous tissues, so clearly indicated by these diagnostic names? Alternative terms such as ‘regional pain syndrome’ or ‘chronic pain syndrome’ merely redefine the clinical problem without providing a mechanism or basis for diagnosis. Despite different diagnostic criteria, these conditions, along with chronic fatigue syndrome, have many demographic and clinical similarities, most notably tender trigger points. Indeed, the terms are often used interchangeably. There are few differences in the symptoms, physical findings, laboratory tests, functional status, psychosocial features and psychiatric disorders. This paper seeks not to deny the existence of aches and pains, but to critically examine the utility of these terms. The only claimed physical sign is the presence of tender trigger points over muscles or muscle attachments. Research suggests that tender points are a measure of general distress related to pain complaints but separately associated with fatigue and depression. They are present in some normal subjects and are variable in occurrence in time in the same individual. They reflect no demonstrable pathology. It is therefore argued that none of these commonly used diagnoses represent distinct disease entities. A possible but unproven alternative hypothesis is that such symptoms relate to neural pain with both peripheral and central components, and in some instances psychological or wilful embellishment.",

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver.

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological factors are widely held to be important for the orderly function of the gastrointestinal tract as well as for the development and course of disorders affecting the gut. Evidence supporting these assumptions is scarce, although it has become clear that intestinal functions are influenced by the state of central nervous activation, i.e. by satiation, relaxation and sleep as well as hunger, tension and rage. Freud assumed that the accumulation of an unabreacted quota of affect induced defence or repression and a conversion of emotion into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasm and ‘cardiospasm’ were viewed as conversion symptoms. Other concepts claimed an aetiological role of specific conflicts, certain affective states and ‘inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life’. However, these and other psychosomatic concepts could not be verified. Conversely, an illness exacerbation may precipitate a disruption in a patient's adjustment to his/her environment and interfere with his/her ability to fight the disease. Psychotherapeutic interventions may help patients to cope with their illness and its consequences and possibly alter the course of disease. Psychosocial factors may determine a patient's reactions to, and handling of, a disease and thus should not escape the physician's attention.",

Hypochondriacal patients misunderstand the nature and significance of these symptoms and believe that they are evidence of serious disease. Hypochondriasis can be a part of another syndrome, usually an affective one, or it can be a primary disorder. The prevalence differs between cultures and social classes. Constitutional factors, disease in the family in childhood, and previous disease predispose to hypochondriasis. Various stressors can be precipitating events. Selective perception of symptoms, motivated by fear of disease, and subsequent increase in anxiety with more somatic symptoms appear to be links in the vicious cycle of the hypochondriacal reaction. Psychotherapy as well as psychotropic drugs are effective in the treatment of functional somatic symptoms. There are no adequate controlled studies of psychotherapy in hypochondriasis, and the recommended treatments are based on studies with similar disorders. The prognosis of treated hypochondriasis is good in a substantial proportion of patients.",

      "title": "[Perioperative disorders of mental functions].",
      "abstract": "Mental disorders are characterized by disturbances of thought, perception, affect and behavior, which occur as a result of brain damage. Recognizing and treating these conditions is necessary not only for psychiatrists but for all physicians. Disorder of mental function is one of the most common associated conditions in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, disturbances of mental function often remain unrecognized. In ICU patients, different types of mental function disorders may develop. They range from sleep disorders, severe depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cognitive disorders including delirium. The causes of mental dysfunction in ICU patients can be divided into environmental and medical. Cognitive disorders are related to mental processes such as learning ability, memory, perception and problem solving. Cognitive disorders are usually not prominent in the early postoperative period and in many cases are discovered after hospital discharge because of difficulties in performing everyday activities at home or at work. The etiology of postoperative cognitive impairment is unclear. Older age, previous presence of cognitive dysfunction, severity of disease, and polypharmacy with more than four drugs are some of the risk factors identified. Delirium is a multifactorial disorder. It is an acute confusional state characterized by alteration of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. It is considered as the most common form of mental distress in ICU patients. Nearly 30% of all hospitalized patients pass through deliriant phase during their hospital stay. Delirium can last for several days to several weeks. Almost always it ends with complete withdrawal of psychopathological symptoms. Sometimes it can evolve into a chronic brain syndrome (dementia). The causes are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease the symptoms. Delirious patient is at risk of complications of immobility and confusion, leading to a high prevalence of irreversible functional decline. An interdisciplinary approach to delirium should also include family or other caregivers. In the diagnosis of delirium, several tests are used to complement clinical assessment. Among the most commonly used are the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test. Depression is a common disorder among patients treated at ICU and occurs due to the impact of the disease on the body and the quality of life, independence, employment and other aspects of life. Depression can interfere with the speed of recovery, affects the postoperative quality of life, and in a certain number of patients may lead to suicidal thoughts and intentions. Phobias and generalized anxiety are the most common anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by strong, excessive anxiety and worry about everyday life events. PTSD is delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation, extremely threatening or catastrophic nature, which is outside the common experience of people and would hit or traumatize almost all people. Treatment of delirium and other disorders is causal. The causes of psychosis are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease symptoms. The primary objective of prevention is appropriate therapy and correction of potential imbalances possibly underlying disturbances, stabilization of vital functions as well as early return to daily activities. Doctors and other medical staff must be aware of the importance and consequences of behavioral and emotional disorders in critically ill patients. Additional research is needed to discover the ways to prevent and/ or reduce the frequency and severity of the consequences and treatment of cognitive and emotional disorders.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Mild head injury is a quiet disorder. It is common, typically bloodless and without call for significant medical intervention. It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

Patient’s data is obtained from medical history and psychiatric interviews done during her hospitalizations. Results 68 year-old patient attended the hospital emergency service due to a demonic possession delusion that emerged when she was 44 year-old, when she first consulted a psychiatrist because she believed someone introduced the demon inside her body. She described kinesthetic hallucinations as “movements of her brain” and an intense headache, both originated by the demon; as well as other types of hallucinations and confabulations. However, there was no deterioration in her personaliy or her intellectual capacity, as it could have been seen in a case of schizophrenia. This clinical case is considered a paraphrenia phantastica as it presents the typical features raised by the classic authors (mainly Henry Ey): paralogical thought dominance, megalomania, confabulation and integrity of relation with reality.

      "title": "Introduction to psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is the branch of medicine which specializes in the treatment of those brain disorders which pri­marily cause disturbance of thought, behaviour, and emotion. These are often referred to as mental, or psy­chiatric, disorders. The boundary with the specialty of neurology, which also deals with disorders of the cen­tral nervous system, is therefore indistinct. Neurology mainly focuses on brain disease with clear physical pathology and/ or obvious peripheral effects on, for ex­ample, motor function. Mental disorders such as depressive disorder and psychoses have been recognized since antiquity. Modern epidemiological studies have demonstrated that they are both highly prevalent and widely dis­tributed across all societies. Overall, mental disorders account for a very high proportion of the disability experienced by the human race (see Chapter 2). Unfortunately, in most societies mental disorders still do not receive the recognition or a level of health ser­vice commensurate with their public health import­ance. There are several reasons for this. Probably most importantly, the brain is a vastly complex organ and the neural systems underlying mental disorders re­main poorly characterized. This inevitably means that our understanding of the pathophysiology is rela­tively poor compared to disorders such as diabetes or heart disease. The absence of a clear body of reliable scientific evidence means that competing unscien­tific views— and stigma— can flourish. Recently, how­ever, our neurobiological techniques have improved in sophistication and sensitivity to the extent that mental disorders have become tractable problems. Phenomena such as mood symptoms, anxiety, and even psychosis seem to exist on a continuum in the population, and the absence of reliable neurobiological measures creates difficulties in determining where the thresholds lie in the gradual change from normality to illness. In clinical practice, the use of diagnostic cri­teria can increase the reliability of diagnoses and re­duce the variations between clinicians. However, small changes in diagnostic criteria can have large effects on the resulting estimates of the prevalence of disorders. Unfortunately, the criteria themselves are based on very imperfect knowledge about the natural history or boundaries of the disorders.",

The clinical manifestations of the ADHD can be grouped into three broad categories: attention deficit, impulsivity (cognitive and motor) and hyperactivity.",

The causes of amputation include trauma, infection, diabetes, vascular disease, cancer and other diseases. The impact of amputation on psychological situation and social and family relationships is undeniable, because physical disability also affects one’s social and mental health, in addition to his/her psychological adaptation and compared to the ordinary people, these people are suffering more from social isolation. Therefore, any limb amputation not only is considered as a physical injury but is also followed by psychological- emotional damages.",

The same mental, emotional and behavioural changes also arise from various medical conditions. For a clinician this dual origin of psychiatric symptoms creates an ongoing diagnostic challenge. Our patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who had been working in a company for around 33 years and always had good appraisals. He presented to mental health services with a 5-year history of persecutory beliefs, convinced that his employers were out to damage his reputation. Apart from a diagnosis of polycythaemia, a few months before the onset of abnormal beliefs, there is no personal or family history of psychiatric disorder or medical illness. His delusions did not respond to conventional treatment with psychotropic medication possibly due to non-adherence because of side effects. However, a series of venesections lead to an improvement in mental state.",

It is the clinical expression for a group of symptoms, the result of failure of important functions of the body, as those of circulation, respiration, excretion and secretion, and general metabolism. A lowered bodily temperature is a more or less constant phenomenon. Shock is intimately connected with the nervous mechanism. In studying shock from anesthesia it is not only essential to consider the specific toxin of the anesthetic used, but the resulting toxic bodies generated through the immediate or more remote influence of general anesthesia. Shock can not, therefore, be expressed in a single definition. The phenomena of shock are so complex that in experimental work on animals it is necessary to study each condition separately, and compile the associated facts obtained and compare",

As a mood state, depression is characterized by feeling despondent or unhappy, while depression as a mood disorder is a persistent set of symptoms as described in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV). Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pain is a personal experience which makes it difficult to define and measure. It includes both the sensory input and any modulation by physiological, psychological and environmental factors. Not surprisingly there are no objective measures – there is no way to measure pain directly by sampling blood or urine or by performing neurophysiological tests. Measurement of pain must therefore rely on recording the patient’s report. The assumption is often made that because the measurement is subjective it must be of little value. The reality is that if the measurements are done properly, remarkably sensitive and consistent results can be obtained. There are contexts, however, when it is not possible to measure pain at all, or when reports are likely to be unreliable. These include impaired consciousness, young children, psychiatric pathology, severe anxiety, unwillingness to co-operate, and inability to understand the measurements. Such problems are deliberately avoided in trials.",

The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

In later life, insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common. Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described. Good sleep should be understood as a substrate for psychological health and a reasonable expectation in later life.",

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

As the experts 7 certified specialists (psychiatrists, psychologists and others) were involved.

Mainly non-specific phenomenon - persecutory delusions. Thus were obtained 14 estimates for each item on a 100-point scale. Dispersion of majority ranges was too high to get significant differences. But 6 from 7 experts significantly (p<0.05) and 1 tendentionally (p<0.01) rated 3 symptoms (autism, conversion and paralogia) as relatively more complex as compared with 7 more simplex phenomena (anxiety, confusion, euphoria, excitement, neurasthenia, phobia and sadness) by U-Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney criteria. established ranges of psychopathological phenomena's complexity reveal non-linear relations to etiology but in some cases they can be useful instrument of differential diagnostics of mental disorders.",

Not infrequently such patients are totally incapacitated, a burden to their families, addicted to drugs, at times mentally unbalanced, unpredictable and always self concerned.

      "abstract": "Around the world, physical symptoms are the most common manifestation of psychological distress. This seeming contradiction presents a diagnostic challenge for health care professionals who are consulted to provide treatment and illness management. In many situations, it is difficult to clearly identify the psychological cause of physical symptoms, and, at times, it is equally difficult to exclude the possibility of an underlying biomedical process. This clinical challenge has led to the construction of the diagnostic category of somatoform disorders, a group of psychiatric disorders characterized by the presence of physical symptoms causing significant distress or functional impairment that cannot be fully explained by a general medical condition, substance use, or any other mental disorder. This category of disorders was established based on clinical utility and the need to exclude medical causes in health care settings rather than on a theoretical model of psychopathology or shared etiology. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association 2000, cited under Classification), the somatoform disorders include somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified. Some authors prefer other terminology, including use of the terms medically unexplained symptoms, emphasizing the uncertainty about diagnosis, or functional somatic syndromes, suggesting that symptoms are due to disturbances in the function of psychophysiological systems rather than structural or anatomical pathology.",

Severe distress and traumatic life circumstances are identified as the main causes of this illness, which are converted into symptoms in individuals. Patients showed ignorance of his symptoms even though these were severe and distressful which was called La-belle indifference. However, it was not shown by many patients, so it was removed from the diagnostic criteria of this illness.

Leitsymptome des psychiatrischen Notfalls sind Störungen des Bewusstseins, des Antriebs und der Stimmung. Ein psychiatrischer Notfall erfordert zum Ausschluss einer exogenen Ursache oder organischer Erkrankung neben der Erhebung eines differenzierten psychopathologischen Befundes obligatorisch eine körperliche Untersuchung und den Einsatz apparativer Untersuchungen. Psychiatrische Notfälle sind nach internistischen Notfällen die zweit- bis dritthäufigste Einsatzursache für einen Notarzt. Psychiatrische Störungen werden in Notaufnahmen nur zum geringen Teil erkannt und angemessen versorgt. Selbst bei gesicherter Suchtmitteleinnahme sollte nach weiteren Ursachen für die Symptomatik und nach begleitenden Verletzungen gesucht werden, damit Differenzialdiagnosen nicht übersehen werden. Für Erregungszustände und sich ankündigende Aggressivität gibt es charakteristische Prodromalsymptome. Sie können jedoch auch unvermutet und völlig unverhältnismäßig auftreten (Raptus). Über 10 % der Ärzte erleiden im Laufe ihres Berufslebens Verletzungen als Folge von Aggressivität durch Patienten. Bei Lebensbedrohung, blindwütigem Rasen oder im Erregungssturm ist das entschiedene, unmissverständliche und koordinierte Vorgehen von medizinischem Personal, Ordnungs- und Rettungskräften zur Verhinderung von Personenschäden aus zahlenmäßig hoher Überlegenheit unumgänglich. Mit der Durchführung eines Suizidversuchs ist Suizidalität in der Regel nicht erloschen. Eine Krisenintervention ist auf die unmittelbare Stabilisierung des Patienten ausgerichtet. Eine Krise wird in den seltensten Fällen durch die Krisenintervention gelöst. Die Kombination von Antipsychotika und Benzodiazepinen ist bei schweren Unruhe- und Erregungszuständen am effektivsten. Eine rasche Besserung bei ängstlichen Depressionen oder quälender innerer Unruhe kann durch Benzodiazepine (z. B. Lorazepam) erfolgen.

      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

      "abstract": "The creation or discovery of animal models of psychiatric conditions, such as major depressive disorder, is fraught with many problems that are not encountered in the development of models in other areas of medicine. Some of these problems are the result of the apparent nature and complexity of the symptoms presented by the psychiatric patient. However, other problems reflect philosophical positions ranging from those based on the premise that primary depression does not fit the medical model and therefore is not a \"disease\" that can be modeled, to those holding that the emotional state of depression is so uniquely human that subhuman organisms cannot be used in its analysis. In evaluating animal models of any human disorder or condition, it is crucial for those using the models to keep abreast of developments and advances in the relevant clinical knowledge concerning the particular condition being studied. This is especially important for such disorders as essential hypertension or major depression where the central causative factors are not yet known, but where extensive clinical investigation is constantly expanding knowledge of the patients' condition.",

      "title": "The Problem of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Functional&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder is an entity that is commonly referred to by names such as psychogenic or conversion disorder [1]. It is defined as a neurological disorder caused by psychological factors, falling into the category of somatic symptom disorders in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Some well-known examples of somatic symptom disorders involving other organ systems include irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and chronic pelvic pain [2].\r\n\r\nPatients with functional disorders are seen in various clinical settings and are commonly admitted as an inpatient for further work-up and symptom management [3]. Those with neurological symptoms in particular may receive work-up beyond the scope of being thorough, as their symptoms can be concerning for neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. Physicians may ultimately become convinced that these patients’ symptoms are due to a psychological cause, but convincing these patients may not be easy, as the suffering is real but the treatment is not instantaneous.\r\n\r\nAs a movement disorders clinical fellow, I often see patients with functional movement disorders. Functional movement disorders can present in various ways such as tremor, myoclonus, or dystonia, but share common clinical features on examination such as variability, distractibility and entrainibility of the movements [4]. Although the term psychogenic is considered to be less ambiguous than functional, its negative nuance may add to the patients’ struggle to accept the diagnosis. Some common reactions are: “Are you saying it is all in my head?” “I find it hard to believe that what I am experiencing is just from stress.” “…but I don’t feel stressed.”\r\n\r\nThrough my fellowship, I have tried different ways of delivering the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder. My strategy has evolved with experience, a mix of successful and unsuccessful situations. For example, the patient might seem to be initially receptive of the diagnosis and considering the recommended treatment options with a positive attitude. When this appeared to be the case, I would feel not only relieved, but also a sense of triumph-I had successfully dealt with a challenging situation, and now surely the patient would be on the road to recovery! I quickly realized that this was not always the case. In the following days, I would receive emails doubting or misinterpreting the diagnosis that seemed to be clear at the time. Some patients seemed unhappy, if not angry or disappointed. I would often review the approach that I had used to deliver the diagnosis on the day of the visit, and try to revise my strategy accordingly, hoping to be more successful the next time.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons may underlie this difficulty of accepting the diagnosis of a functional disorder. Currently, the knowledge on the physiology of the disorder is limited, and we cannot satisfactorily explain to these patients exactly how this occurs, which may add to the patient’s skepticism towards the diagnosis. The variability of symptoms, a common feature of the disorder itself, may confuse and deceive the patients, leaving them to wonder what rare organic neurological disorder they might have as the cause. Last but not least, patients may be influenced by the stigma of having any disorder that has relation to psychological factors, and even misinterpret the diagnosis as malingering, an intentional production of symptoms.\r\n\r\nBut do we physicians also have difficulty embracing the diagnosis of a functional disorder? Some patients are seen by several physicians and undergo extensive testing until seen by someone who might finally share the diagnosis. It is not unusual that this can be years later since the beginning of symptoms. Delivering the diagnosis is certainly challenging for reasons mentioned above, and physicians fear missing an organic neurological disorder. However, simply labeling these patients as having ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ not only leads to increased healthcare cost [5], but can result in increased morbidity and mortality from unnecessary diagnostic workup or treatment.\r\n\r\n“How can you tell me it’s functional when I am not functional?” The words of a patient echo through my head as I share this diagnosis with yet another patient. I only hope to be able to help my patients so that they understand that the diagnosis was achieved through identifying positive signs and symptoms, and that it is not merely a diagnosis of exclusion. I try to reassure them that this disorder is very much real, involuntary and acknowledge that it can be very disabling. Some patients have accepted the diagnosis and made a substantial recovery through cognitive behavioral therapy. Hopefully, with more knowledge on the physiology, increased awareness of the disorder in both patients and the medical community and better strategies of sharing the diagnosis functional can one day become truly functional.",

      "abstract": "The essential feature of functional somatic syndromes is the presence of symptoms without medical explanation. the syndromes have a high psychiatric co-morbidity, and stress and anxiety are assumed to play a role, at least in the maintenance of the complaints. Psychophysiological models traditionally attribute the symptoms to stress or anxiety-related disregulations in specific physiological mechanisms. In fact, however, there is no convincing empirical proof for such models. The idea of a direct coupling between self-reported symptoms and corresponding physiological disregulations thus seems hardly tenable. Therefore, we propose a reformulation of the potential role of stress physiology in diagnosing functional somatic symptoms. Physiological measures should not be used anymore to demonstrate explanatory physiological disregulations. They should instead be used to provide additional information about the state of activity of the central fear network . This alternative approach is based on the fact that self-reported and physiological manifestations of an emotional state are only loosely coupled, making both aspects complementary indicators of the brain activity involved. Physiological measures may thus provide additional information (above self-report) regarding emotional states implicated in functional complaints. A suggested application of this approach is to define sub-groups of functional somatic patients on the basis of similarities in disregulated physiological stress-response profiles. This in future may contribute to the development of more specific diagnostic tools and better tailored treatments.",

Mental trauma or psychological injury has been underdiagnosed as a basis for litigation, and attorneys often overlook the need to screen accident victims and family members. Clinical data reveal that it is not conclusive to extrapolate findings related to grief to a particular drowning event. Grief is emotional, is often an unknown reaction, and it does not always make sense. As an individual experiences grief, dwelling on what has been lost is part of the normal process. The individual is faced with their loss on a daily basis and for some, moving through this process may be very difficult. This is an assessment conducted by a neuropsychologist or a trained skill psychometrist. Neuropsychological evaluations document patterns of strengths and weakness among cognitive and behavioral functions, behavioral alterations, and cognitive changes resulting from a central nervous system (CNS) disease or injury.",

      "title": "Fatigue in Healthy and Diseased Individuals",
      "abstract": "Objectives: Although fatigue is experienced by everyone, its definition and classification remains under debate. Methods: A review of the previously published data on fatigue. Results: Fatigue is influenced by age, gender, physical condition, type of food, latency to last meal, mental status, psychological conditions, personality type, life experience, and the health status of an individual. Fatigue may not only be a symptom but also a measurable and quantifiable dimension, also known as fatigability. Additionally, it may be classified as a condition occurring at rest or under exercise or stress, as physiologic reaction or pathologic condition, as spontaneous phenomenon or triggerable state, as resistant or irresistant to preconditioning, training, or attitude, as prominent or collateral experience, and as accessible or inaccessible to any type of treatment or intervention. Fatigue may be the sole symptom of a disease or one among others. It may be also classified as acute or chronic. Quantification of fatigability is achievable by fatigue scores, force measurement, electromyography, or other means. Fatigue and fatigability need to be delineated from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exhaustion, exercise intolerance, lack of vigor, weakness, inertia, or tiredness. Among neurological disorders, the prevalence of fatigue is particularly increased in multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and bleeding and also in neuromuscular disorders. Fatigue may be influenced by training, mental preconditioning, or drugs. Conclusions: Fatigue needs to be recognized as an important condition that is not only a symptom but may also be quantified and can be modified by various measures depending on the underlying cause.",

Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

Instead, brain function is disordered; hence, current preference for the term “functional neurological disorder.” Conversion symptoms exist at the interface between neurology and psychiatry and remain a common cause of disability and distress.

Acting out differs from symptomatic actions in that the symptomatic act is ego alien and usually refers to part of a past situation. Acting out occurs very frequently during analysis. It should be remembered, however, that it also occurs outside the realm of psychoanalysis, but then it is not available for investigation and interpretation. The main reason for the frequent occurrence of acting out during the course of analysis is bound up with the transference.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status.

The clinical differentiation between functional and organic disease is at times difficult to establish, because, presumptively, in the beginning, at least, all organic disease is preceded by a physiologic perversion, that is, functional alteration, which may or may not be apparent with our present diagnostic limitations.

Mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis are less commonly encountered but potentially highly debilitating conditions that may be underrecognized.

      "abstract": "Patients presenting with bodily symptoms and complaints that are not sufficiently explained by organic pathology or well known pathophysiological mechanisms present a major challenge to any health delivery system. From a perspective of psychiatric classification these medically unexplained somatic symptoms may be diagnosed as primary psychiatric disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders on the one hand, as somatoform disorders on the other. Among medical specialties a separate diagnostic approach is taken to conceptualize functional somatic syndromes. Unfortunately, both diagnostic systems do not conform to each other very well. The concept of somatoform disorders as outlined in DSM-III to DSM-IV-TR and in ICD-10 refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders with prominent somatic symptoms or special body-focussed anxieties, or convictions of illness. These disorders seem to indicate medical conditions that cannot, however, fully be explained either in terms of medical diagnostics or of other primary psychiatric disorders. There is one major conceptual assumption that postulates a decisive impact of psychosocial stress on the origin, onset and/or course of these somatic symptoms and complaints. And there is one major path of diagnostic steps to be taken, i.e. just to count the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, to determine their reference to any main organ system, to prove that they are not self-induced, to put special stress on prevailing pain symptoms and to separately assess dominant health anxieties or illness convictions. Since introduction of the diagnostic concept of somatoform disorders there have been arising many critical issues regarding the soundness of this diagnostic category. These issues, among other things, refer to a problematic mind-body dichotomy overemphasizing psychosocial and psychological factors and neglecting major neurobiological processes, to the impracticable criterion of “medically unexplained”, to the demand of conceptual clarity and coherence of this diagnostic category, to the rather trivial diagnostic procedure of just counting the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms whereas not assessing typical dimensions of illness behaviour in a corresponding way, to the major overlap between subgroups of somatoform disorders on the one hand and factitious disorders, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders on the other, to a principal focus on the epidemiologically rare condition of somatisation disorder as core disorder thereby undervaluing much more prevalent subthreshold conditions, to the difficult communication of the whole diagnostic group to medical colleagues dealing with the same problems by using a different conceptual approach, however. These critical issues surrounding the concept of somatoform disorder will be reflected in respect of some major revisions projected in future diagnostic classification systems of DSM-V and ICD-11.",

It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals.

Evidence of cerebral dysfunction may show up in one or more areas, such as sensory or motor function, intellectual functioning, emotional control, manifestation of seizure phenomena, and others.

They may arise in the course of any disease process. Not infrequently cases appear in which a morbid mental state constitutes the essential etiologic soil out of which the somatic, or bodily, symptoms arise. On the other hand, organic disease is constantly giving rise to emotional or mental reactions. On whichever basis they may arise, much of the mental symptomatology commonly encountered can be interpreted by the general medical practitioner. The general physician often hesitates to deal with mental conditions, although he attacks with confidence problems of equally obscure organic, serologic or bacterial origin. For example, the clinician makes use of the technical researches of the specialist in cardiorenal disorders, or of the biochemist in diabetes, or of the endocrinologist in the use of complicated ductless gland therapy.

      "title": "Neurobiological evidence for epilepsy-induced interictal disturbances.",
      "abstract": "It is not in the best interest of persons with epilepsy to deny the possibility that seizures could cause enduring behavioral disturbances. Rather, it is essential to pursue clinical and animal investigations in order to identify any such changes that might occur and to elucidate their mechanisms. Many testable hypotheses can be developed from existing evidence. Antiepileptic medication may produce interictal behavioral disturbances in patients with epilepsy by indirect mechanisms. Some aberrant behaviors could be due to medication-induced systemic disorders, neuroendocrine dysfunction, or REM deficit, whereas depression following successful treatment with drugs, as well as with surgery, may be related more specifically to cessation of seizures. The underlying neuropathological process also induces neurological and mental deficits, but it is not always possible to differentiate those behavioral disturbances due to destructive effects of the lesion from those due to recurrent epileptic seizures. Behavioral disturbances are associated more frequently with epileptogenic lesions in limbic structures than with those elsewhere in the brain, but a relationship between hemispheric lateralization of the epileptogenic lesion and specific interictal behavioral symptoms remains controversial. When considering the effects of seizures per se on interictal behavior, it is important to realize that some \"interictal\" behavioral disturbances may actually be ictal events. Prolonged affective, autonomic, and psychic disturbances can occur in clear consciousness with unilateral limbic seizures that are not associated with scalp EEG changes. When epilepsy is acquired as a result of cerebral damage, the epileptogenic process takes time to develop before spontaneous seizures appear. It is more reasonable to assume that this progressive process continues than to postulate that it stops completely at the time the first seizure occurs. Epilepsy-induced protective homeostatic mechanisms that act to terminate ictal events, prevent ictal spread, and maintain the interictal state may also disrupt interictal function. Furthermore, seizures could indirectly influence interictal behavior as a result of their effects on neuroendocrine function and sleep. Because of confounding biological factors, it is difficult to document the association of any epilepsy disorder, by itself, with progressive behavioral disturbances in humans. Secondary epileptogenesis, protective homeostatic mechanisms, and epilepsy-induced disturbances in development can be readily demonstrated, however, in experimental animal models. In experimental animals, endogenous opoids are released during seizures and mediate some postictal behaviors. A physiological dependency on high levels of endogenous opioids released during seizures could produce depression as a withdrawal symptom interictally or when seizures no longer occur as a result of successful therapy. Experimental animal models of depression exist to test hypotheses concerning pro- and antidepressant effects of epileptogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

To the emotional unrest caused by these vestiges of ancient taboos may be added disturbances of the female reproductive organs that are caused by other emotional conflicts. In psychosomatic illness, the patient is a victim of some emotional conflict of which she is unaware. Her symptoms are real, but the causes are elusive. Because she is disturbed, she consults a physician in an effort to discover an organic basis for her symptoms. Menstrual disturbances; vague, low, abdominal pain; intramenstrual cramping; headache, nausea, vomiting; palpitation, loose stools, and urinary frequency may be associated with emotional conflicts. Marital problems may be the causative factor, or may intensify gynecological conditions. Sexual maladjustment may cause a woman to be frigid or to have dyspareunia. Menstrual disturbances may be the only manifestation of her unhappiness. Some physicians believe that emotional conflicts may play an important part in sterility. A patient who consults her physician because of symptoms for which no physical basis may be found needs as much sympathy and understanding as does the patient with demonstrable physical pathology. Her pains and aches, troubles and miseries, discontents and disappointments are very real to her; she must not simply be classed as neurotic, ignored when she lists her complaints, or rushed through her examination and consultation with the physician. The nurse's understanding will be of great comfort to this patient and perhaps will even be a factor in helping her get well.",

The secretive and sometimes criminal nature of these behaviors provides numerous barriers to research, but important data have been collected. After discussing the available research base of the factitious disorders, potential assessment procedures using medical records are detailed.",

      "abstract": "During adolescence, many biological, psychological and social changes occur, but in general the process of physical maturation occurs faster than psychological maturation. During adolescence, there are many things that cause people in general to experience mental disorders. Some mental disorders that usually occur are caused by various existing stressors which can cause anxiety disorders, depression and lead to suicide. Adolescents who grow up in a conducive environment will rarely experience mental disorders which are usually suffered by most teenagers who experience these mental disorders. This mental disorder can be prevented. There are many mental disorders whose symptoms and causes are difficult to determine. It is sometimes difficult to see the difference between ordinary teenage moodiness and signs of more serious illness, although the illness usually begins in late adolescence or young adulthood. Symptoms in adolescents may appear gradually over days, weeks, or weeks. several months or more",

The neuroanatomy remains poorly defined but three levels seem likely: a) a cortical level; b) a bulbar, or effector, level; and 3) a synkinetic, or integrative, level probably at or near the hypothalamus. Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

As the terms of reference of this book are psychosomatic disease, it is not proposed to go into detail regarding moderate or major psychiatric illnesses such as severe depression and schizophrenia. The very fact that a patient is in hospital is frequently therapeutic in itself as it means that society, relatives and friends have acknowledged the person's right to receive care and help, and that he is 'worthy' for this to take place. Naturally such a formulation is never spelt out but is implicit in the total situation of hospital admission or even out-patient care. In the majority of conditions where a specific event needs to be altered or cured, for example pneumonia, appendicitis, childbirth, there will be in most cases no need for any further considerations towards the patient's mental state other than perhaps a mild sedative at night. When, however, it has been decided that stress or unresolved anxiety is playing a part in the maintenance of the symptoms, then notwithstanding a specific measure such as gastrectomy or administration of anti-hypertensive drugs, those caring for the patient may wish to use other measures, which can be divided into specific and non-specific.",

      "title": "Somatisation as a manifestation of emotional disturbance in children",
      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

Ситуація в країні сприяє збільшенню травматичних стресів, які можуть мати серйозні наслідки для дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Ці події порушують базове відчуття безпеки особистості дитини та можуть призвести до розвитку різних психічних проблем. Травматичний стрес може викликати травматичний стресовий синдром (ТСС) або посттравматичний стресовий розлад (ПТСР), які характеризуються різними симптомами, такими як повторні спогади про травматичну подію, проблеми зі сном, харчові розлади, депресія тощо. У дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку ці симптоми можуть бути особливо вираженими та можуть потребувати специфічної та індивідуалізованої підтримки. Крім того, травматичні стреси можуть сприяти розвитку інших невротичних і психічних розладів, таких як тривожність, депресія, різноманітні фобії тощо. Ці розлади можуть значно ускладнити життя дитини й вимагати комплексного підходу до їх корекції та підтримки. Однією з важливих характеристик особистості дитини з порушенням інтелектуального розвитку є незрілість її емоційної сфери. Тому важливо вчасно виявляти та вирішувати проблеми, пов’язані з травматичним стресом, у дітей з порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Саморегуляція вважається ключовою якістю особистості й важливим фактором гармонійних міжособистісних відносин у дітей із такими порушеннями як самих із собою, так і з оточуючим світом. Саморегуляція сприяє подоланню різноманітних перешкод, що заважають повноцінному включенню дитини в реальне життя, а також дозволяє розкрити її психологічний потенціал.",

The condition can manifest itself in several ways and can be triggered in different scenarios, facts that render it a peculiar and multifaceted clinical entity. Nosologically, insomnia can be understood as a symptom or as a disorder with its own characteristics and has a chronic course. Insomnia disorder is more common among women and older adults, as well as in social risk strata, and is usually associated with comorbidities, particularly mental disorders. The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder have changed as new perspectives emerge. The cause-based classification (e.g., secondary to clinical diseases; associated with poor sleep hygiene) was abandoned in the latest editions of clinical manuals, which combined the subdivisions into a single entity, insomnia disorder. There are varied pathophysiological mechanisms that involve physiological and psychological features. The chronification of insomnia is more easily understood based on psychosocial models, especially Spielman's model that explains the development and maintenance of insomnia based on predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. The most recent challenge is to determine new clinical phenotypes that allow a more assertive approach and treatment.",

In other instances, especially when the discharges are more atypical, the psychic disturbances may take on the character of either a simple worsening of behavior or of a confusional state with agitation and delirium, or of a stuporous state. The temporal lobe statuses, which are much more rare, manifest themselves either as a succession of psychomotor attacks, or as protracted confusional or confusooneiric episodes. An EEG makes it possible, at any rate, to differentiate between the petit mal statuses and the temporal lobe statuses.

Verbal description is only one of several behaviors to express pain; inability to communicate does not negate the possibility that a human or a non-human animal experiences pain. Many disease processes give rise to both nociceptive and neuropathic pain at the same time. Chronic primary pain is chronic pain in one or more anatomical regions, and is characterised by significant emotional distress or functional disability and can include forms of chronic pelvic pain.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations.

People become more stable with sympathetic listening. The experience of loss and its associated feelings can be faced with acceptance, and even psychotic conditions can evaporate when the ring of isolation is broken. Refugees have a higher risk of mental illness than others, showing depression, anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder. Because little has been written about refugees from a mental health perspective, professionals working therapeutically with them may not give as much consideration to socio-political and psychosocial influences as to traumatic events experienced by refugees. The feelings of helplessness that some refugees experience can be seen as typical of many situations of trauma. Recent scientific literature, mainly in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has recognized post traumatic stress disorder, both acute and chronic, as a specific clinical entity.",

      "abstract": "Every illness represents in some way a threat and increases the sense of vulnerability. The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "title": "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach to Hypothalamic Amenorrhea",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation. The most important aspect consider about the role of psychotic symptoms in diagnostic formulation is the impact on the patient.",

      "title": "Symptoms and the perception of disease",
      "abstract": "Any symptom represents a perception of an abnormal internal body state. The threshold for perceiving the internal body state as abnormal varies and depends particularly on psychological influences. As a result, a symptom can either reflect pathology, whether serious or not, or be generated wholly psychologically. Intuition allowing discrimination between these possibilities is central to the physician9s art. Particular difficulty arises in differentiating between those psychologically generated symptoms which are produced unconsciously, often as a result of anxiety or depression, and those that constitute deliberate deception. Such malingering has the unstated intent of accessing a secondary gain, such as welfare benefit. The art of diagnosis includes estimation of whether symptoms resonate with known pathophysiological processes, using history-taking as a story which unfolds logically towards a diagnosis, assessing how a patient reacts to their symptoms compared to neutral matters, detecting exaggeration or falsification, and documenting evidence of psychologically generated abnormalities during examination. Scientific ability is only one of the attributes of a good diagnostician; equally important are abilities to notice things, to weigh up human nature and to recognise dilemmas. Our procedures for selecting medical students and physicians need to assess these skills as well as scientific qualifications.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained physical symptoms",
      "abstract": "Concern about physical symptoms is a common reason for people to seek medical help. Many of these symptoms, such as headache, chest pain, weakness, dizziness, and fatigue, remain unexplained by identi­fiable disease even after careful medical assessment. Several general terms have been used to describe these types of symptom— somatoform, medically un­explained, and functional. We prefer the terms ‘med­ically unexplained physical symptom’ or ‘functional symptom’, because they imply a disturbance of some kind in bodily functioning without implying that the symptom is psychogenic. Patients and doctors often assume that a physical symptom implies that a phys­ical pathology exists. However, commonly experienced and often severe, distressing, and disabling symp­toms, such as menstrual pain or ‘tension headache’, indicate that this is not always the case. By assuming that a physical symptom is explained by physical dis­ease/ pathology, we may be subjecting the patient to unnecessary tests and hospital visits, adding to pa­tient distress, and failing to deliver the integrated management required. There are many kinds of these symptoms (Box 25.1), presenting across healthcare settings. They are con­sidered in this psychiatry textbook because (1) psy­chological factors (including, at times, psychiatric disorder) are important in aetiology and (2) psycho­logical and behavioural interventions have a funda­mental role in treatment A major obstacle to effective management of pa­tients with functional symptoms is that they feel their doctor does not believe them. They are concerned that they may be thought to be ‘putting it on’. Note that the deliberate manufacture or exaggeration of symptoms or signs (malingering) is quite different (see p. 359). Diagnoses of three kinds may be given: … ● Descriptive physical syndromes. These include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, non- cardiac chest pain, chronic pain syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the specific terms are useful in everyday medical practice, there is substantial overlap, and many patients with, for example, fibromyalgia will also have IBS. ● Psychiatric syndromes as the primary cause of the functional symptoms. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and adjustment, are common primary causes of functional symptoms, and commonly present via the general hospital’s emergency department or cardiology clinic.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

Depression, the most common mood disorder affecting TBI survivors, most likely is underdiagnosed and presents differently than primary depression or depression after other brain insults. Unfortunately, few studies have been reported that advance theoretical perspectives on post-TBI depression. Currently, there is some evidence that neurochemical and anatomical changes contribute to post-TBI depression. Interpersonal factors, such as sense of belonging and social support, may contribute to the incidence of post-TBI depression. Because of limited theoretical viewpoints, advances have not been made in cost-effective and efficient interventions for this mood disorder, which prolongs rehabilitation and contributes to family suffering.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a condition of continuous low mood and loss of energy that affects a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings, and physical condition. It is a disease with a thousand faces and is one of the most common disorders nowadays. Although until recently depression was considered a disorder that affects adults and the elderly, research has shown that this disorder is increasingly occurring in children, adolescents, and younger people. Adolescence is a turbulent period in which psychosocial maturity is achieved, identity is formed, crises of earlier developmental stages are resolved. If crises are not adequately resolved, the action of hereditary or various psychological, emotional and social factors leads to the development of depression. Symptoms that manifest in a depressed adolescent can be of varying intensity, may be short-lived, and may be present throughout life. Depression most commonly occurs as a primary disorder, but it can also occur in combination with other psychological disorders. In adolescents, it carries a high risk of developing delinquent behaviour, substance abuse and alcohol abuse, school failure, and suicide attempt. Diagnosing depression in children and adolescents can be challenging due to the specificity of the clinical picture in relation to adults. Therefore, a team of experts participates in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, and an important role in the team is played by a subspecialist in child and adolescent psychiatry. The treatment of depression in children and adolescents aims to eliminate symptoms and achieve complete remission, prevent recurrence, alleviate long-term morbidity and create conditions for normal growth and development. The treatment requires a holistic and multimodal approach, which includes psychoeducation, psychotherapy and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. With proper diagnosis, choice of treatment methods and the inevitable support of family and friends, depression can be cured. Since depression is a multifactorial disease, which leaves numerous consequences on the further physical and mental health of adolescents, the emphasis is on prevention. Risk and protection factors can be found in the school, family and social environment, which then means that prevention should also be multifactorial.",

It is suggested that the extent of such injury is unrelated to the magnitude of shock current and that the timing of the ldquodiffuse electrical injuryrdquo may be indefinitely delayed with respect to the time of the sustained shock. Other reports refer to possible shock injury mechanisms that manifest solely with neuropsychological symptoms. A critical examination of this literature reveals no mechanistic basis for the association of the proposed physical symptoms of diffuse electrical injury with remote injury. Additionally, serious errors in the stated methodology of the publications citing the existence of diffuse electrical injury cast doubt upon the scientific basis for the stated conclusions.",

The majority of sleep-related movement disorders is represented by benign conditions which have no known adverse effects on health. Many of these disorders include muscular jerking of the torso or legs. Some disorders consist of repetitive movement of the legs. The severity of each of these disorders varies greatly and, in severe forms, the sleep-related movement disorders can result in sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness. Importantly, similar movements can arise from disease of muscle, nerve, spinal cord or even brain, so if movement is frequent or severe, it is best to consult a health care professional.",

The physical challenges of living with a vascular malformation will affect the patient's psychological health, and psychological factors will affect the patient's experience of their physical health. Psychological difficulties are typically the result of a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors. As such, having a vascular malformation will not result in the same psychological outcomes for each young person. Having a new healthy baby is a known stressor that can precipitate a range of stress-related reactions in parents, including major mental health difficulties. When a child has physical health differences, the stress can increase as a result of uncertainty about the infant's health and development and the extra health care burden of hospital attendances and daily management at home.",

Solitary confinement and prolonged sleep deprivation are just two examples of these psychological torture methods. Even psychological methods which do not amount to ill-treatment when considered in isolation, amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, when applied in conjunction with other techniques, cumulatively and/or over a long time. Often they are part and parcel of the whole torture process and constitute a “background environment” of harassment and duress. The “cumulation over time” factor must thus be considered as part of a system of psychological torture.",

It would be absurd to contend that such harm is somehow intrinsically less serious than physical injury; indeed, over many years, medical research has pointed to the artificiality of characterising it as lacking physical manifestations. Its destructive potential is brought into sharper focus as mental attributes become ever more integral to everyday functioning. Yet, to this day, neither popular nor judicial opinion is noticeably receptive to a cause of action based on proof of a “recognised psychiatric disorder”, which is still often trivialised by the label “nervous shock”. This negative attitude is most apparent when claimants are not, or are not regarded as, the direct victims of someone else's conduct. The very notion of compensating people whose suffering derives from their reaction to the injuring of others often evokes surprise, indignation and disdain.",

However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

Included in these descriptions would be ‘atypical facial pain’, and perhaps the similar pain syndromes which present in the mouth and the perineal regions. The term ‘atypical pain’ is most unsatisfactory, as it really means nothing to any observer except to the person who originally coined the phrase for pain which seemed to be an atypical variant of some other recognized condition. To be preferred is the expression ‘idiopathic pain’ with its implication of a disorder of pain perception, or ‘pain of unknown aetiology’.

Akuter Beginn der Erkrankung, variable Ausprägung der Symptomatik, Ablenkbarkeit und spezielle klinische Provokationsmanöver helfen bei der Diagnosestellung. So weisen ein akuter Beginn des Tremors oder aber auch eine spontane Remission, eine rasche Verschlechterung mit Ausbreitung auf den gesamten Körper mit anschließendem statischen Verlauf auf eine mögliche psychogene Ursache hin. Die Schilderung der Symptome durch den Patienten kann entweder von einer „belle indifférence“, d.h. mit einer abnormen Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber der Schwere der Erkrankung vorgetragen werden, die der Behinderung nicht angemessen erscheint. Der psychogene Tremor fällt durch die Variabilität in Amplitude und Frequenz auf, außerdem tritt er eher am Unterarm als an den Fingern auf, zeigt somit einen abnehmenden Gradienten von proximal nach distal. Manche Formen fallen auch durch eine bizarr anmutende Ausgestaltung oder eine an eine Tätigkeit erinnernde Form auf (Teigrührer-Tremor). Der Distraktionstest macht sich die Tatsache zunutze, dass die meisten organischen Bewegungsstörungen unter mentaler Anspannung eher zu- als abnehmen. Beim kontralateralen Aktivierungstest wird der Patient aufgefordert, eine Position einzunehmen, in der der Tremor am stärksten ausgeprägt ist. Dann soll er mit der nicht-tremorösen Hand auf einen vorher vereinbarten Punkt zeigen. Bei Bewegungsstart kommt es zu einem kurzfristigen Sistieren des Tremors auf der kontralateralen Seite. Dieses Sistieren tritt sowohl beim Parkinson-Tremor als auch beim essentiellen Tremor nicht auf. Beim Entrainment-Test fordert man den Patienten auf, einen Takt mit einer Hand zu klopfen, dessen Frequenz vorgegeben und variiert wird. Ein psychogener Tremor wird in der Regel aus dem Rhythmus gebracht werden, kurzfristig sistieren oder sich an den Klopf-Rhythmus anpassen.",

The symptoms of depression associated with a medical condition are basically the same as those in endogenous depression, including depressed mood, sadness, diminished mental activity, and impatience. However, depression associated with chronic organic brain disorders is characterized by the predominant symptoms of diminished intellectual capacity, apathetic tendency, lability of mood, retardation in thinking and speech, and flat affect, whereas depressive mood, insomnia, anorexia, low self- esteem, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicidal ideation are mild.",

      "abstract": "Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are physical symptoms that have existed for several weeks, for which adequate medical examination or investigation has not revealed any medical condition that sufficiently explains the symptoms. Physical symptoms such as headaches, back pain, abdominal pain, dizziness and feelings of weakness or fatigue are common. MUS is a working hypothesis based on the assumption that somatic or psychiatric pathology have been adequately detected and treated but clinical condition presented by the patient was not adequately resolved. Any change in symptoms could be a reason to revise the working hypothesis of MUS. The biopsychosocial model proposes illness to be viewed as a result of interacting mechanisms at the biomedical, interpersonal and environmental or contextual levels. Therefore the exploration of symptoms in patients with MUS should focus on the exact chronology of the symptoms themselves, including where and when the symptoms appear. Based on the exploration of symptoms, the clinician is able to evaluate the severity of MUS.",

By reviewing various epidemiological studies, relationships among some chronic diseases and depression have been noted. The depression-disease order of appearance can de bi-directional. It seems that stress, depression and inflammation have the capacity to affect the balance of cykotines produced by the immunological system. Modulation of the immunological system by the central nervous system is controIled/mediada by a complex bi-directional network composed of signals among the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immunological system. The most frequent diseases related to depression are chronic but some are acute: of the central nervous system, endocrines, infections. Chronic pain also seems related to this problem. Pain, fatigue or tiredness are considered symptoms of a hidden depression and others, physical as well as psychiatric, could be algias, parestesias, headaches, vertigo, or gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory neurodegenerative disorders.",

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV) (1), a delusion is a false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes. Hallucination is a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception, but that occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ. The person may or may not have insight in that he or she is having a hallucination. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions are the cardinal features of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, delusional disorder, and brief psychotic disorder. Psychotic symptoms may also occur during the course of delirium or dementias and may be due to a range of other general medical and neurological conditions, including PD.",

Since specific studies have yielded a relatively large numbers of cases in the past, it can be concluded that the disorder is probably more prevalent than is suggested in the literature. These cases may well be not only primary types, based on mental or unclear causes, but also secondary types, mediated by aberrant somatosensory sensations. Treatment of the underlying condition (in most cases a psychotic or mood disorder) has proved to be increasingly successful over time.Because of the possible co-occurrence of zoanthropy and alterations in coenesthesis, i.e. the sensation of physical existence, mental health workers should be on the lookout for cases of clinical zoanthropy in clinical practice and avoid treating them in the same way as they would treat other delusions. All cases that occur should be subjected to extra somatic investigations – including an EEG and neuroimaging – and treatment should be adjusted in accordance with the findings.",

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

The disability may be unrecognized or denied by the sufferer and may attract social stigma rather than sympathy from others. The effect on mental health is surprisingly neglected. Early studies of psychiatric patients suggested hearing impairment is an important cause of paranoid illness, but more recent studies of wider populations have failed to confirm this association. Hearing impairment is unrelated to intellect when controlled for age, but is an important differential diagnosis of dementia in the elderly. Evidence accumulates to suggest that the hearing impaired are vulnerable to depression, social stress and isolation, but reliable controlled studies of psychiatric sequelae are needed.",

      "abstract": "The search for organic bases of mental illnesses is one of the central goals of psychiatry. Unlike other etiological hypotheses hard to verify, the search for organic bases brings psychiatry closer to other medical specialities. Such dysfunction may be primary (if it affects the brain directly or selectively) or secondary (if the dysfunction concerns various organs or systems including the brain). Reporting clinical cases in which there are clear connections between substrate damage and psychopathological expression can be illuminating, and occasionally a guide for future research. Two cases are presented with symptoms suggestive of childhood bipolar disorder, both due to organic causes.",

      "title": "Extreme Psychospiritual States Versus Organic Brain Disease: Bringing Together Science and the Human Factor",
      "abstract": "Extreme states can be psychospiritual and “functional” in origin or they can be “organic” and driven by biological dysfunction. Contemporary psychiatry largely rejects this distinction, preferring to insist that everything “extreme” is biological in origin; but the distinction is important for understanding and helping people. Psychospiritual crises, including those labeled bipolar or schizophrenic, are “functional” and express meaning. As “bizarre” as the language or the symbols may seem, meanings that often reflect childhood abuse can be explored in a trusting, kind, and caring therapeutic relationship. The more that a real biological or organic dysfunction, such as traumatic head injury or neurotoxic exposure, is the root cause of the extreme state, the less sense its manifestations will make. Nonetheless, drug-induced extreme states, even when caused by hallucinogens or by psychiatric “medicines,” often leave sufficient brain function operational to reveal important meanings about the person’s experience, along with the otherwise senseless intoxication. With so many people prescribed psychiatric drugs, these neurotoxic chemicals are now the most common cause of extreme states in clinical practice, and withdrawal from these offending agents is critical to recovery (Breggin, 2013). However, even when the extreme state is driven by neurological dysfunction, a safe space and skilled therapists can help relieve the individual’s otherwise overwhelming feelings of anxiety or terror.",

      "abstract": "Functional disorders are clinical entities corresponding to complaints mimicking diseases without a clearly identified organic substrate despite a rigorous history and clinical examination. Sometimes, complementary examinations are necessary to rule out an organic lesion that could explain the symptomatology. The notion of a diagnosis of exclusion is therefore very present. The physician must constantly re-evaluate the diagnosis of functional disorder in order not to «miss» a diagnosis with an organic cause.The treatment of these functional disorders is sometimes based on psychological treatment when a psychogenic dimension seems to be involved. This is not always the case. In such cases it is necessary to be able to consider a placebo approach with the hope that the placebo effect may improve the patient's condition. This article discusses the placebo effect in functional disorders without omitting to address ethical and philosophical considerations.Les troubles fonctionnels sont des entités cliniques correspondant à des plaintes mimant des maladies sans substrat organique clairement identifié, malgré une anamnèse et un examen clinique rigoureux. Parfois, certains examens complémentaires sont nécessaires pour infirmer une lésion organique pouvant expliquer la symptomatologie. La notion de diagnostic d’exclusion est donc bien présente. Le praticien se doit de réévaluer sans cesse le diagnostic de trouble fonctionnel afin de ne pas «passer à côté» d’un diagnostic avec une cause organique. Le traitement de ces troubles fonctionnels repose parfois sur une prise en charge psychologique lorsqu’une dimension psychogène semble incriminée. Ce n’est pas toujours le cas. Il faut alors pouvoir être capable d’envisager une approche via des placebo en espérant que l’effet placebo puisse améliorer la condition du (de la) patient(e). Cet article décrit l’effet placebo dans les troubles fonctionnels, sans omettre d’aborder des notions éthiques et philosophiques.",

      "title": "The Behavioural Dimension of Brain Disorders-An Area for Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a branch of medicine with a relatively short history. Although mental illness has probably existed throughout the history of mankind, it has received little attention from the medical perspective. Major psychoses have been considered as either spiritual or functional until recently. The functional or organic dichotomy has been the official watershed dividing the disciplines of Neurology and Psychiatry. While Neurology follows the basic medical approach, Psychiatry takes a much broader, and perhaps more diffuse, perspective. During the past few decades, there has been a quantum leap in the volume of basic neuroscientific research. A much better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying most, if not all, psychiatric disorders has led to a revolutionary change in the concept of mental disorders. Most functional or psychogenic problems have now been found to have an 'organic' aetiology. Functional psychiatric disorders are much better perceived as medical disorders leading to disturbances in brain function. Clinical manifestations are disturbances of the integration between mood, perception, and thought processes. The old distinction between diseases as either neurological or psychiatric faces challenges to its validity. It would be over-simplistic to assume that brain disorders will manifest either along the neurological or psychiatric dimension, and be managed with a single approach. In this issue, the significance of a combined neuropsychiatric approach to the assessment and management of brain disorders is highlighted. The article on depressive disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) underscores the prevalent psychiatric co-morbidity in this classical neurological disorder. (1) Discovery of degeneration of the dopaminergic system in this disorder led to the development of an associated treatment. It is well-recognised that PD is readily amenable to pharmacological interventions that bolster dopaminergic transmission. Nevertheless, the focusing of attention on the motor symptoms of PD is associated with a neglect of other important determinants of quality of life, such as depressive disorders and other psychopathology. The report on mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS) provides an excellent example of the complex neuropsychiatric manifestations of a rare metabolic brain disease. (2) In MELAS, a combination of neurological and psychiatric symptomatology, and use of sophisticated neuroimaging and laboratory technology are required to make the diagnosis. It is perhaps meaningless to argue about the importance of paying dual attention to the neurological and psychiatric aspects of brain disorders. A more intriguing question may be the need for a division between Psychiatry and Neurology, or more specifically, the distinction between Behavioural Neurology and Neuropsychiatry. …",

      "title": "Pseudobulbar affect masquerading as psychosis: Managing a case of diagnostic dilemma",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA) is a clinical condition characterized by uncontrollable emotional outbursts, incongruent with the person's emotional state and often out of keeping with the situational context. It manifests mostly as uncontrollable laughter or crying in inappropriate situations.[1] PBA is also referred to as Emotional incontinence, Pathological Laughter and Crying (PLC), and Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder (IEED).[2] PBA is most commonly seen occurring in the background of neurological disorders like in post-stroke period, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or traumatic brain injury.[3-5] However, it can also be seen without any apparent neurological disorders.[5] Historically PBA has been an under-recognized and under-treated condition, which brings in significant distress, stigma and shame for the person suffering from the condition.[6] Along with the social stigma of inappropriate laughing or crying, it often carries with it the burden of being tagged with mental illness.[7] The newer and probably less stigmatizing term IEED can provide some respite to those with the condition as an acknowledgement of their suffering. This case report presents a patient with PBA without any neurological comorbidities who improved significantly with fluoxetine and dextromethorphan. A 59-year-old, widowed female, coming from an urban background, presented with episodes of uncontrollable laughter spells in inappropriate situations for the past 1.5 years. She also reported occasional mild slurring and difficulty deglutition for the same duration. These laughter spells would occur every 2-3 days, occurring for 5-15 minutes. These would be typically incongruent to the context. For example, occurring while in inappropriate social situations like in a funeral house. These incidents would make her extremely embarrassed and she had to leave the situation altogether as she could not control her laughing. Her family members too would scold her for doing so, apparently a willful act as per them, and would ask her if she has gone mad. She would feel sad over these incidents and tell her family members that she was not doing this willfully and it was not under her control. These episodes were accompanied by on-and-off difficulty in deglutition, mild slurring of speech and a subjective sense of hypersalivation. These symptoms would aggravate prolonged speaking or chewing. All these incidents would occur with intact awareness and responsiveness. Sleep onset insomnia was present. There was no history of associated low or elevated mood, anhedonia, disproportionate physical fatigue, somatic preoccupation or dissociative episodes. Past psychiatric history revealed nothing significant. She was not known to be diabetic, hypertensive, hypothyroid or obese. There was no history of head injury, seizures or stroke either. She had never taken any substance of abuse. She was taken to psychiatrists as her family members thought she might be having some psychiatric illness. She was suspected to have psychosis, unspecified and was given trials of quetiapine up to 100 mg and later olanzapine up to 25 mg. Both these treatments improved her sleep only but no improvement was observed in the uncontrollable laughter episodes. On presentation, she was neither sad nor overtly cheerful, though expressed her worry and guilt about the inappropriate laughter episodes and social disgrace. No other thought or perceptual abnormality was noted. She had good insight into her symptoms. On neurological examination, speech was normal, jaw jerk and palmomental reflex were absent. Blood sugar, thyroid panel, lipids and electrolytes came out to be normal. We admitted her for diagnostic evaluation. Neurology and otorhinolaryngology consultation-liaison were sought. MRI Brain was suggested by neurology which came out to be normal. Based on the clinical presentation, examination and investigation findings we considered a diagnosis of Pseudo-bulbar affect of unknown etiology. Due to the unavailability of a Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination, we started her on Dextromethorphan 20 mg and Fluoxetine 40 mg. She tolerated the treatment without any side-effects. Over the next couple of days, she did not report much improvement and was discharged on the same treatment. She adhered to treatment and on follow-up visit one month later, she reported significant improvement in laughter spells, which occurred only once during that period. She had started attending social gatherings again without any issues. From the second follow up Dextromethorphan was gradually tapered and stopped; Fluoxetine has been continued. She is maintaining well on current treatment. We are regularly following her up in liaison with the Neurology team as over due course of time some underlying neurological cause may become evident. PBA is a disorder which is poorly recognized, variably characterized, and causes significant distress and dysfunction for patients and their families. Patients are often ascribed mental illnesses like schizophrenia or mania in many of these cases of PBA leading to unnecessary treatment.[8] Further, the drug side effect burden adds to the misery of the patients. Our patient had consulted several psychiatrists, who treated her with antipsychotics without much improvement in her symptoms. We could not find any underlying neurological condition despite a neurological workup but she responded well with treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan. The neurobiology of PBA is still unclear; most likely to be of multifactorial causation. Disruption of the cortico-limbic-subcortico-thalamic-pontocerebellar network, which is involved in the regulation and expression of emotion, has been hypothesized.[9] In many cases, no neurological association is found even after a thorough workup. A patient-rated instrument, Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is used commonly to rate the severity of PBA.[10] It is validated for use in patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS).[11] The Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS) is another patient-rated instrument validated to rate the severity of PBA in post-stroke patients.[12] PBA is a clinical diagnosis. While these scales are not used to diagnose PBA, these are used to rate the severity and improvement with treatment. Treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan/quinidine has shown promising results in cases of PBA.[13,14] Our case emphasizes the need to have clinical suspicion in such cases presenting with unexplained mood outbursts before categorizing them as specific psychiatric illnesses. Detailed neurological evaluation needs to be undertaken in such cases. Timely recognition of PBA is essential for an effective treatment.

      "abstract": "Deprem, sel, yangın gibi doğal afetler, trafik kazaları, maden kazaları, patlamalar gibi felaketler, kişilerin birbirine karşı taksirle ya da kasten gerçekleştirdiği fiiller ya da kişilerin kendilerine karşı gerçekleştirdikleri eylemler, fiziksel etkilenmeye yol açabildiği gibi ruhsal etkilenmelere de neden olabilmektedir. Ruhsal etkilenmeler, geçici olabileceği gibi ciddi, uzun süre tedavi gerektirebilen ve hatta bazen kalıcı özellik gösteren ruhsal bozukluklar olarak ortaya çıkabilmektedir. Travmalara bağlı olarak en sık görülen ruhsal bozukluk, travma sonrası stres bozukluğudur. Bulguları; yetişkinler, çocuklar ve adolesanlarda farklılık gösterebilmektedir. Özellikle çocuklarda bu tür etkilenmeler, normal gelişimsel süreci önemli derecede etkileyebilmektedir. Bu nedenle, travma olgularında ayrıntılı değerlendirme önem taşımaktadır. Ruhsal değerlendirme ve tanı koyma sürecinin çoğunlukla hastanın anlattıklarına dayalı olması, simülasyon açısından en riskli durumlar olmalarına sebep olmaktadır. Ayrıca, kişilerin tazminat davalarında maddi bir çıkar elde etme iç güdülerinin kimi zaman bazı değerlerin önüne geçmesi, travma ilişkili ruhsal bozuklukları değerlendiren hekimlerin bu konuda daha dikkatli olmalarını gerektirmektedir. Değerlendirilen olgularda şüpheye düşülmesi, kesin bir kanaatin oluşmaması durumlarında, kişinin gözlem altında tutularak değerlendirilmesinin istenebileceği bilinmelidir. Bu bölümde, travmalarda en sık görülen ruhsal hastalık olan travma sonrası stres bozukluğunun tanı kriterlerini ve klinik özelliklerini, travmalarda görülen ruhsal bozuklukların ceza ve tazminat hukukundaki yerini ve travmalardan sonra görülebilen ruhsal etkilenmelerin adli tıbbi değerlendirmesinde dikkat edilmesi gereken kriterleri belirtmek amaçlanmıştır.",

If measures are not made to periodically relieve these pressures, carers run a significant risk of collapsing and may have a variety of physical and emotional issues. A weaker immune system, high blood pressure, heart problems, depression, and other harmful health conditions have all been linked to prolonged stress. Any external or internal discomfort that is caused by a physical, chemical, or emotional stressor may contribute to the complaint. Stress can also be defined as a state of being. Trauma, illnesses, poisons, injuries of any type, and infections of all kinds are examples of physical and chemical variables that can cause stress. There are many different types of emotional reasons of stress and strain. While numerous people associate the term stress with cerebral stress, scientists and croakers use this term to denote any force that impairs the stability and balance of fleshly functions.

These psycho-behavioral manifestations can be isolated, coexist, or complicate a neurological deficit, thus raising questions about their imputability. Our goal is to shed light on the extent to which cranial traumas contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders and their specific characteristics. Ultimately, we aim to establish the foundations for an optimal biopsychosocial and legislative management approach if necessary. This will be illustrated through the clinical case of a patient who exhibited depressive symptoms shortly after the onset of delusional ideas with a psychotic nature, one year after experiencing a cranial trauma due to a public road accident. The somatic consequences of cranial trauma can cause psychotic symptoms. This is referred to as a post-traumatic psychotic disorder directly linked to localized brain damage, adhering to the structure-function paradigm. Such symptoms can appear up to four years later. The authors have reported that the onset of psychotic symptoms is frequently associated with depressive syndrome, which is a factor contributing to the chronicization of post-traumatic psychosis. Psychotic symptoms following Psychotic manifestations, such as delusions and hallucinations, can occur in various psychiatric and somatic disorders, especially neurological and neurosurgical conditions. These behaviors can occur alone, work in conjunction, or complicate a neurological deficit, raising questions about their connection to the condition. We want to understand how head injuries contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders and their specific characteristics.

      "abstract": "As the field of movement disorders has developed and matured over the past 25 years, psychogenic movement disorders have become increasingly recognized in subspecialty clinics. The diagnosis can be challenging and should be based on positive features rather than a purely exclusionary approach. The clinical phenotype can be quite varied, although certain categories of abnormal movement are more common than others. Electrophysiological studies may be particularly useful in establishing the diagnosis, especially with respect to tremor and myoclonus, and an argument can be made for adding a \"laboratory-supported definite\" category to earlier classification schemes. The diagnosis of psychogenic dystonia remains a major challenge, although there are some recent promising developments with respect to the evaluation of cortical plasticity that require further study. The pathogenesis of psychogenic movement disorders is poorly understood; insights may be provided from the study of other neurological conversion disorders such as psychogenic hemiparesis. Psychogenic movement disorders typically result in considerable disability and negatively impact quality of life to the same or greater extent than do many organic movement disorders. Treatment is extremely challenging, and many patients experience chronic disability despite various therapeutic interventions. Given the personal and societal impact of these problems, further advances in our understanding of their pathogenesis and the subsequent development of effective therapies are sorely needed.",

The poor response to psychological treatments is noteworthy and organic features, of a specific type, have been implicated. The most recent evidence strongly supports earlier findings of a genetic factor. Damage or malfunction of the left temporal lobe of the brain, or of the frontal area, are associated with violent psychopathic behaviour. Dysfunction in these same areas has also been found in schizophrenic patients and there is a genetic relationship between psychopathy and schizophrenia. It is concluded that organic factors probably underpin some psychopathic behaviour, a situation which may affect our attitudes.",

MRI of brain demonstrated calcification of bilateral basal ganglia, thalami and left dentate nucleus of left cerebellum. The clinical presentation similar to our patient is frequently misdiagnosed due to identical manifestation to other neurological and psychiatric disorders especially in young to middle aged individuals.

Dans les deux sexes, un tiers a deux tiers des patients environ presentent un ou plusieurs symptomes ou indices d’alteration de la vie sexuelle. Les troubles les plus importants, de beaucoup les plus frequents, sont inter-critiques. Dans la tres grande majorite des cas, il s’agit d’une baisse de l’activite sexuelle, qui peut affecter, isolement ou en association, le desir et l’interet sexuels, l’excitation ou l’orgasme. Ces troubles s’observent majoritairement dans les epilepsies partielles, particulierement les epilepsies temporales, mais peuvent concerner aussi les sujets presentant une epilepsie generalisee idiopathique. Les perturbations a l’origine de ces troubles sexuels sont multiples, psychologiques mais aussi physiologiques. L’etiologie de ces troubles, quasi certainement multifactorielle, reste imparfaitement elucidee. Les decharges et crises epileptiques, les lesions cerebrales, des troubles ou handicaps psychiques, intellectuels et sociaux, des modifications hormonales et neuro-endocriniennes, des effets collateraux des medicaments antiepileptiques, le traitement neuro-chirurgical de l’epilepsie sont autant de facteurs contributifs ou etiologiques dont certains sont fortement co-dependants. Les troubles sexuels en relation avec les crises sont beaucoup plus rares, qu’il s’agisse de crises comportant une semiologie de type sexuel ou d’exceptionnelles crises survenant en relation temporelle avec une activite sexuelle. En raison de la frequence des troubles sexuels intercritiques et de leur impact negatif notoire sur la qualite de vie, l’amelioration de leur depistage diagnostique et de leur prise en charge therapeutique est un objectif de soins tres important.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In these patients, cognitive, mood, and emotional disturbances are commonly observed, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, and anger/aggression. The debilitating effect of TBI extends years after the initial injury and impairs the recovery process and patients' quality of life. Compared to other major neurological diseases such as stroke or degenerative diseases, TBI occurs relatively young. Therefore, patients have to endure the sequelae for a more extended period. Therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment of the cognitive–emotional symptoms are essential. Studies have been made to seek the pathogenesis of the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been underrecognized and understudied. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare. It has been suggested that the congitive and emotional sequelae are related to the \"remote\" effect of the initial brain injury rather than the initial pathology itself. This review will describe some of the most common or relevant poststroke mood and emotional disturbances. The phenomenology, factors or predictors, and relevant lesion locations will be described, and pharmacological treatment of these emotional disturbances will be discussed based on presumable pathophysiological mechanisms.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a complex disorder that is commonly associated with brain dysfunction, social isolation, and vocational difficulty. Each of these factors may contribute to the increased prevalence of psychiatric illness in epilepsy, but emerging evidence is providing a more complete and clearer elucidation of the problem. Clinical investigations have consistently demonstrated that depression has a large impact on subjective health status. In patients with recurrent seizures, depression appears to have a stronger association with quality of life than does the seizure rate. In fact, depression is second only to medication toxicity as the clinical factor that explains the greatest variance in quality of life. Only a small number of studies have investigated the plausible neurobiological mechanisms of depression in epilepsy, but preliminary data suggest that underlying brain dysfunction may be a more important predictor than vocational or social disability. Furthermore, specific aspects of hippocampal dysfunction may be a causal factor in the genesis and maintenance of depression in temporal lobe epilepsy. Current treatment recommendations for depression in epilepsy are similar to those for otherwise neurologically normal depressed patients, emphasizing the role of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but certain antidepressants should be used with caution. Ongoing studies are attempting to define optimal treatment strategies, and more definitive data to guide clinical management are expected to become available in the near future.",

      "abstract": "FrenchDeux hypothèses opposées continuent à embrouiller le traitement pharmacologique des psychoses dépressives:1° La dépression résulte d'une déficience biochimique, marquée par la diminution de l'énergie psychocinétique. Elle doit être traitée par des méthodes stimulantes et énergétiques.2° Les états dépressifs sont des troubles multidimensionnels des fonctions psycho-biologiques. Il est impossible de les exprimer sous la forme d'un simple antagonisme.L'étude clinique des effets du Tofrānil a fait supposer dès le début que ce corps exerçait une activité sélective sur les syndromes dépressifs. On observe rarement une action mentale spécifique, au sens d'un syndrome psycho-affectif provoqué par la médication. Ni l'euphorie, ni la stimulation psychocinétique ne marchent régulièrement de pair avec les effets du Tofrānil sur le cerveau. La caractéristique thérapeutique de ce corps est une dissolution du syndrome dépressif, et une restauration de l'état affectif normal.Un fait étonnant est que le spectre de cette activité thérapeutique demeure discontinu. Alors que, dès le début des recherches, il a paru évident que le Tofrānil exerce son action optimale sur les dépressions accompagnées d'inhibition, on ne peut pas toujours escompter le résultat du traitement, du fait que certains sujets avec symptômes d'inhibition typiques ne sont nullement améliorés, tandis que d'autres voient leur état se modifier de façon impressionnante.L'attention des chercheurs s'est concentrée sur l'identification des facteurs psychopathologiques qui semblent particulièrement sensibles à l'action du Tofrānil. De tels symptômes ont été sélectionnés tant dans le domaine du comportement, que sur le plan psychosomatique et le plan expérimental. Au für et à mesure des progrès de la thérapeutique, il a été possible de préciser les signes, ou les groupes de signes, susceptibles de modification, ainsi que ceux qui demeuraient réfractaires au traitement. Les appréciations finales sont basées sur l'élimination totale ou partielle des symptômes-clés. Cette analyse phénoménologique s'est avérée très précieuse dans les recherches psychopharmacologiques entreprises pour identifier les effets différentiels des agents thérapeutiques.L'auteur cherche ensuite à déterminer si l'action thérapeutique est suspensive, correctrice ou préventive. Le matériel clinique comporte en première ligne des malades atteints de psychoses dépressives et hospitalisés. Il englobe, en outre, un groupe de patients en traitement ambulatoire, dont l'anamnèse présente de fréquents accès de dépression. L'auteur cherche, pour finir, à répondre à la question de savoir si les indications relatives du Tofrānil et du traitement électroconvulsif peuvent être formulées. Il se base pour cela sur des expériences de thérapeutique comparée, entreprises avec le même matériel clinique.",

Selye defined stress as a function of elevated corticosteroid levels and used the term stress to refer to the effects of any agent that threatens the homeostasis of the organism. The term allostasis which refers to the body’s ability to achieve stability. The allostatic load is assumed to be caused by frequent stress, lack of adaptation to repeated stress, and inability to shut down the allostatic response when the stress is over and inadequate response or dysfunction of the stress systems  Thus, psychological stress can be defined as a discrepancy between personal capacities and environmental demands. Somatic stress symptoms are related to both physiological and psychological stress. The different types of stressors are likely to elicit divergent stress reactions. The multifaceted nature of stress and various sources of stress must also be taken into account. It is important to define the stress precisely in epidemiological studies. Consequently, stress has been determined here in terms of stressful life events, experience of chronic stress, experimentally induced mental and physiological stress reactions and work stress. The work stress models that are presented here have been used extensively in studies of occupational and cardiovascular health. The inheritance of stress refers here to an innate temperament. Rationale is as follows: temperament a) has a biological basis, b) is highly inherited, and c) explains what one experiences as a stress and partly determines what the health consequences are. The common assumption in several temperament theories is that temperament plays important role in moderating stress. In the end we presented the comparative analysis between the eustress and distress.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ? Existent-t-ils et quelle est la valeur des outils diagnostiques moins contraignants comme par exemple l’agenda de sommeil, l’actimétrie ?

      "abstract": "People react to illness in a manner that reflects a complex and evolving interaction of several factors. Most illnesses, except the very trivial, require a period of adjustment and a re-appraisal of lifestyle, ability to work and engagement in leisure activities. Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression. Depression resulting from the emotional impact of an illness follows an appraisal of the implications that the illness has on relationships, lifestyle, work prospects, long-term disability and mortality.",

      "title": "Management of blackouts and misdiagnosis of epilepsy and falls",
      "abstract": "‘Collapse?cause’ is a colloquial term that is widely used, especially in acute and emergency medical practice in the UK. Patients with ‘collapse?cause’ can be defined as having suffered ‘a physical collapse due to an abrupt loss of postural tone’. There may or may not have been accompanying loss of consciousness. Some patients with ‘collapse?cause’ will have suffered a stroke, others may have an acute metabolic disorder, such as hypoglycaemia, and others may have collapsed due to the effects of drugs. However, very many such patients with collapse will have suffered a ‘blackout’ (ie transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC)), with consequent collapse. It is these patients who most frequently present a diagnostic problem, since there will often be no symptoms, signs or laboratory findings of stroke, metabolic disorder or drug effect; they may have completely recovered upon admission; all the admitting doctor has to rely on is a second-hand ‘word-ofmouth’ description of the features of the blackout and collapse from bystanders, who are usually lay observers. It seems to be commonly assumed that T-LOC represents a primary neurological disturbance, and the differential diagnosis often focuses on epilepsy versus syncope. It is poorly understood that syncope is quite often convulsive, and may feature limb twitching and sometimes urinary incontinence. Syncope, defined ‘as transient loss of consciousness due to global impairment of cerebral perfusion’, 1 is very common, with up to 50% of the population having syncope at some stage in life. Syncope is the sixth most common cause of emergency admission in the UK, 2 accounting for 3% of all attendances to the emergency departments and 1% of all hospital admissions. In contrast, epilepsy affects about 0.5‐1% of the population. 3 Syncope is probably far more common than epilepsy, but this seems to go unrecognised. As a consequence, the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is very common, with 20‐30% of adults misdiagnosed with epilepsy, and a greater percentage of children. 3 The misdiagnosis of epilepsy is thought to cost the NHS about £200m per annum, and recent settlements for compensation in misdiagnosed and mistreated cases will further add to this cost. Misdiagnosis has been a feature in children, 4 but a major problem also exists with misdiagnosis in older patients.",

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5) does not list malingering in its diagnostic section and therefore does not identify it as a formal mental disorder, malingering and verified mental illness commonly coexist. Some subtypes of feigning behaviors, such as partial or pure malingering, dissimulation, and false imputation, can be suspected when patients have marked discrepancies between reported stressors and objective findings. The article discusses these three theoretical concepts with their possible clinical aspects, illustrating each phenomenon by clinical case with self-reported and/or observed psychotic symptoms.

Longitudinal studies indicate that some patients with schizophrenia and major affective disorders go through a ‘schizo-affective period’ on the way to developing the clinical picture of the other disorder, while still other patients have a continuity of syndrome type.

Dabei sind bis zu 150 verschiedene Symptome beschrieben worden, die diesem Syndrom zugeordnet werden konnen. Allein die Vielzahl der Symptome weist darauf hin, wie unscharf der Symptomenkomplex charakterisiert ist. We it unklarer als die klinische Beschreibung ist seine Pathophysiologie. Nach klinischen Gesichtspunkten spricht man von einem pramenstruellen Syndrom, wenn es urn die Beschreibung von psychischen oder somatischen Beschwerden geht, die pramenstruell auftreten und postmenstruell vollig verschwinden (Dalton 1985). Das pramenstruelle Syndrom war offensichtlich schon im klassischen Altertum bekannt. Bereits Hippokrates bezog Veranderungen der Gemiltslage in der pramenstruellen Phase auf ein Verhalten des Regelbluts. Die Regelblutung wurde als ReinigungsprozeB des Korpers und der Seele aufgefaBt. Zu den soma tisch en Beschwerden, die im Rahmen des pramenstruellen Syndroms gesehen werden, gehort die Odemneigung mit Gewichtszunahme, Brustspannen mit Mastodynie, Vollegefilhl mit Obstipationsneigung und Ubelkeit. Bei den psychovegetativen Symptomen stehen erhohte Reizbarkeit, Aggressivitat, Stimmungslabilitat, Angstlichkeit, Antriebsarmut, Schlaflosigkeit, Appetitveranderungen, gesteigerter Durst, Libidobeeintrachtigung, Konzentrationsund Koordinationsschwache im Vordergrund. Die Wesensveranderung kann so we it reichen, daB Kleptomanie, Pyromanie, Trunksucht, Nymphomanie und Halluzinationen beobachtet werden. Das pramenstruelle Syndrom gilt in GroBbritannien als strafmildern, in Frankreich gar als zeitweilige Unzurechnungsfahigkeit. Hinsichtlich der Pathophysiologie des pramenstruellen Syndroms gibt es eine Reihe von Hypothesen. Der zeitliche Zusammenhang zwischen der Menstruation und dem Auftreten dieses Syndroms lieB vermuten, daB eine gesWrte Ovarialfunktion mit veranderter Relation von Ostrogenund Progesteronsekretion ursachlich verantwortlich zu machen sei (Backstrom et al. 1976). Eine unzureichende sekretorische Umwandlung des J::ndometriums machte einen relativen Progesteronmangel zusatzlich wahrscheinlich. Damit wurde gleichzeitig ein relatives Uberwiegen der Ostrogenwirkung angenommen. Die gilnstigen therapeutischen Wirkungen einer Progesteronsubstitution schienen diese Hypothese zu bestatigen. In klinischen Studien, in denen serienmaBig Plasmaspiegel von Ostradiol und Progesteron bestimmt wurden, zeigte sich, daB das pramenstruelle Syndrom sowohl bei ovulatorischen als auch bei anovulatorischen Zyklen auftreten kann (Reid u.

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "abstract": "Lanjut usia (lansia) adalah bagian dari proses tumbuh kembang manusia. Manusia tidak secara tiba tiba menjadi tua, tetapi berkembang dari bayi, anak-anak, dewasa dan akhirnya menjadi tua. Masa tua merupakan masa hidup manusia yang terakhir atau periode penutup dalam rentang hidup seseorang, masa ini di mulai usia enam puluh sampai meninggal yang di tandai dengan adanya perubahan fisik, psikologis, sosial dan spiritual yang semakin menurun. Penyakit yang sering dijumpai pada lansia adalah hipertensi berdampak pada jantung dan stroke. Pengobatan hipertensi berlangsung seumur hidup sehingga harus dikombinasikan dengan pengobatan non farmakologis yaitu relaksasi napas dalam.  Proses menua akan terjadi perubahan-perubahan baik anatomis, biologis, fisiologis maupun psikologis. Gejala-gejala kemunduran fisik antara lain kulit mulai mengendur, timbul keriput, mulai beruban, pendengaran dan penglihatan berkurang, mudah lelah, gerakan mulai lamban dan kurang lincah masalah tersebut akan berpotensi pada masalah kesehatan baik secara umum maupun kesehatan jiwa adalah satu kesehatan jiwa yang terganggu adalah mengalami kecemasan. Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas. Kata Kunci : Cemas, Lansia, Hipertensi, Relaksasi Nafas Dalam ABSRACT Elderly (elderly) is part of the human development process. Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes. Symptoms of physical deterioration include sagging skin, wrinkles, graying, reduced hearing and vision, fatigue, slow movement and less agility.These problems will potentially lead to health problems both in general and mental health is a disturbed mental health. is experiencing anxiety. This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

      "title": "Nondrowning Asphyxia in Veterinary Forensic Pathology",
      "abstract": "Asphyxia in a forensic context refers to death by rapid cerebral anoxia or hypoxia due to accidental or nonaccidental injury. Death due to nondrowning asphyxia can occur with strangulation, suffocation, and mechanical asphyxia, each of which is categorized based on the mechanism of injury. Individuals dying due to various types of asphyxia may or may not have lesions, and even those lesions that are present may be due to other causes. The interpretation or opinion that death was due to asphyxia requires definitive and compelling evidence from the postmortem examination, death scene, and/or history. Beyond the postmortem examination, pathologists may be faced with questions of forensic importance that revolve around the behavioral and physiological responses in animals subjected to strangulation, suffocation, or mechanical asphyxia to determine if the animal suffered. While there is no prescriptive answer to these questions, it is apparent that, because of physiological and anatomical differences between humans and animals, for some mechanisms of asphyxia, consciousness is maintained for longer periods and the onset of death is later in animals than that described for people. Veterinary pathologists must be cognizant that direct extrapolation from the medical forensic literature to animals may be incorrect. This article reviews the terminology, classification, mechanisms, and lesions associated with asphyxial deaths in companion animals and highlights significant comparative differences of the response to various types of asphyxia in animals and people.",

Jackson's observations that brain lesions could cause \"uncinate fits\" or the focal motor seizures which later bore his name also led him to consider seizure classifications based upon anatomical and pathological issues in addition to clinical phenomenology. Confusing epileptic seizures with the condition of epilepsy has fostered imprecise terminology and clinical inexactitudes. Seizures are discrete epileptic events, the manifestations of transient, hypersynchronous, abnormal neuronal behavior. The initial events of a seizure, either described by the patient or an observer, are usually the most reliable clinical indication of whether a seizure begins focally or is generalized from the beginning.",

While classical forms of major hysteria are less frequent in occurrence in recent years, the etiological basis of the pattern still is clinically significant. Conversion reactions and psychophysiological reactions affecting various body systems continue to be a part of the spectrum of psychiatric illness seen in active practice. While no organic cause for the symptoms is present, the loss of function, when substantial and persistent, equates with the loss of function resulting from actual organic disease. Not all of these reactions occur in the ‘hysterical personality’, and both social and cultural patterns must be taken into account. In evaluating the severity of an impairment (loss of function) resulting from a functional illness, the psychological and physiological homeostasis of the patient is a crucial consideration. Symptoms derived from purely conscious reactions are seldom associated with actual loss of function.",

However, since such perception, besides serving as the alarm phase, could also be indicative of other, and often adverse, physiological effects, it has been the subject of much research since the early decades of last century [1-5]. These efforts, which have resulted in a vast body of the very valuable scientific findings, revolve around the physiological processes that stressors prompt in the biologic system; and how they affect its equilibrium, i.e., its homeostasis. But how the physiological processes are triggered through involvement of sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis, as well as other systemsthe underlying cause of what can be considered the over-drive engagements of these systemshas seemingly escaped scientific scrutiny and remains unanswered; perhaps because it does not have much bearing on the medical treatments of the ensuing effects of sustained (chronic) stress sensation, and also mainly because much about the details of brain processing of sensory data has not been clearly figured out, though the role of the brain in perception of the world, and life as a whole, has been widely recognized since the enlightenment era; early 17th century. However progress, in last few decades, in understanding modus operandi of the brain, has led to further recognition of the fact that much of the brain operations are computational in nature: It is inferred that brain, and the rest of the nervous system, comprise extensive computational machinery that process all sense-relayed information; using its innate (evolutionary-formulated) instructions, imbedded in its constructs (as patterns), for analyzing events and creating perceptions. In the context of such idealization of the operation of the brain [6], this work is an attempt to throw some light on the puzzle of stress; suggesting a mechanism for creation of its sensation, and the prompting of the physiologic effects.",

Of course, this usage eliminates neither illnesses nor the subjective experience of being ill, but it has implications for forensic psychiatry and for the assessment of a person’s legal responsibility. Having schizophrenic delusions constitutes a categorically different state from having only wishful illusions or a vivid imagination. In the context of medicine and psychiatry, we certainly encounter stages that signal fundamental differences. These differences are easily detected when assessing psychotic disorders or similar states, but a lot of differences also arise when assessing perpetrators with personality disorders or simply antisocial behavior.

      "title": "Treating Insomnia Disorder in the Context of Medical and Psychiatric Comorbidities",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a commoncondition. It is estimated that approximately 30% of the population experiences some symptom of insomnia, and approximately 5% to 15% of these individuals are likely tomeet criteria for an insomniadisorder.1 Traditionally, insomnia was considered as either a primary disorder or secondary to another medical or psychiatric condition. During the past 2 decades, multiple lines of evidence have converged to support the proposition that insomnia, regardless of concurrent medical and/or psychiatric illness, is an independent disorder and should be treated accordingly.2 Partially in response, insomnia is now formally classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) as a separate disorder, and thediagnosisof insomnia secondary toanother condition was removed. Numerous studies have shown that targeted treatment for insomnia iseffective in thecontextofother conditions. The success of cognitivebehavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)with secondaryor comorbid insomnia strongly suggests that, although insomniamaybe precipitated by psychiatric and/or medical illness, it is likely perpetuated by the same factors that are responsible for primary (chronic) insomnia.2 The application of CBT-I in patients with comorbid insomnia also had one significant and unexpected outcome: treatment gains were evident for the so-called parent disorder. For example, CBT-I in patients with depression led to 29% lower depression ratings vs medication alone.3 Given that numerous studies have found that CBT-I produces significant treatment outcomes in insomnia comorbid with such disorders as depression, chronic pain, and cancer (andoftenwithoutcomes that equal or exceed thenormswith uncomplicated insomnia), the time seems ripe to take stock of such findings within the framework of a proper metaanalysis. The investigation in this issueof JAMAInternalMedicine byWu and colleagues4 does precisely this. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia generally includes several components, such as sleep restriction therapy (aligningsleepopportunitywithsleepability tomaximizesleep efficiency), stimulus control therapy (maximizing the stimulus value of the bed andbedroom for sleep), sleephygiene (alleviatingobviousbarriers to sleep), cognitive therapy (addressingnighttime ruminations,worries, and fears), andsometimes relaxation interventions (reducingphysiologic arousal).5 Prior meta-analyses6 have shown that CBT-I is an efficacious treatment for reducing sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and earlymorning awakenings, aswell as increasing sleep efficiency. Furthermore, comparative meta-analyses7 have shown that CBT-I performs at least as well as pharmacotherapy or even slightly better in the short term, with superior results in the long term. Based on these and other findings, CBT-I has been adopted as a recommended first-line treatment for insomnia by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. ThestudybyWuandcolleagues4examinedavailable clinical trials that evaluated CBT-I for insomnia in the context of other conditions. Studies were found that examined insomnia treatment in the context of substance abuse, renal disease, chronicpain, cancer,depression,posttraumatic stressdisorder,andotherconditions.Overall, this studyfoundthatCBT-I was associatedwith an increased likelihoodof remission from insomnia (odds ratio, 3.28; 95%CI, 2.30-4.68;P < .001). In addition, positive findingswere seen for improvements in sleep efficiencyandoverall sleepquality. Positive findingswere also seen for thecomorbidcondition ingeneral, such thatCBT-I improved noninsomnia outcomes as well. There was a significant interaction: effects on psychiatric comorbid conditions weremore robust thanwere effects for nonpsychiatric comorbidities. Themeta-analysis showed thatnotonlywasCBT-I effective in the faceof comorbid conditions, but theeffectswere relatively large (although slightly smaller thanmight be seen in primary insomnia). The studyhada few limitations that suggest directions for future research. First, the meta-analysis focused on remission and did not summarize outcomes with respect to treatment response. Second, the study couldhaveplacedmore focus on the benefits of CBT-I for the comorbid condition. As noted above, there are several studies in the literature showing that treatment of comorbid insomnia not only improves the insomnia but also improves severity and/or tolerance of symptoms of the comorbid condition (eg, produces treatRelated article page 1461 Research Original Investigation Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Comorbid Insomnia",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC. Sin embargo, en la mayor parte de los casos las crisis no provocadas se presentan en ninos en los cuales no LOS EXPERTOS RESPONDEN Arch Pediatr Urug 2002; 73(4): 233-235",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of angina pectoris depend on obtaining an adequate history. Problems in diagnosis arise because of confusion of terminology, language difficulties, symptoms resembling noncardiac disease or vice versa, and the coexistence of angina pectoris with disease of other organs. Problems in differential diagnosis arise because symptoms resembling angina may result from disease or abnormal function of the brain, skeletal system, gastrointestinal system, or structures in the bony thorax or within the thoracic cage. The most difficult problems in differential diagnosis arise from psychoneurosis and gallbladder disease. Careful history taking will resolve the problem in most instances, prolonged observation will settle the question in others. To date, no objective tests have been adequate to determine whether or not the patient is subject to attacks of pain due to the physiologic effects of coronary artery pathology or dysfunction.",

It can be a personality tendency, an emotional state, or a syndrome; clinical anxiety occurs when the feeling becomes more severe, persistent or pervasive than normal. Work factors are important in producing anxiety especially when they interact with home, marital or leisure problems. Anxiety can be assessed by interview, formal rating scales, measurement of physiological and endocrine variables such as heart rate and adrenaline excretion. Anxiety is the commonest of milder psychiatric conditions and may present in many ways which the clinician should aim to detect.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Several illnesses expressed somatically that do not have clearly demonstrated pathophysiological origin and that are associated with neuropsychological complaints are reviewed. Among them are nonepileptic seizures, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, Persian Gulf War unexplained illnesses, toxic mold and sick building syndrome, and silicone breast implant disease. Some of these illnesses may be associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, but it is not likely that these abnormalities are caused by traditionally defined neurological disease. Instead, the cognitive abnormalities may be caused by a complex interaction between biological and psychological factors. Nonepileptic seizures serve as an excellent model of medically unexplained symptoms. Although nonepileptic seizures clearly are associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, they are not of neurological origin. There is evidence that severe stressors and PTSD are associated with immune system problems, neurochemical changes, and various diseases; these data blur the distinctions between psychological and organic etiologies. Diagnostic problems are intensified by the fact that many patients are poor historians. Patients are prone to omit history of severe stressors and psychiatric problems, and the inability to talk about stressors increases the likelihood of suffering from physiological forms of stress.",

      "abstract": "Similar to the adult patient, a child or adolescent may actively feign or produce artificial symptoms (synonymous: Munchausen syndrome). The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan).

Psychosis due to TBI, also referred to as PD TBI in the literature is characterized by the presence of hallucinations and/or delusions in the aftermath of traumatic brain injury. The diagnosis is difficult to make because it requires the clinician to make a determination of whether the psychosis resulted from the brain injury or whether it is a manifestation of another illness. This can be particularly challenging because there can exist a significant lag between the time of head injury and onset of psychotic symptoms. To further complicate the picture, some patients have additional neurological conditions, either primary or secondary to the TBI that may confound the presence of psychotic symptoms.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a type of emotional dysfunction caused by genetic abnormalities or great changes in the patient’s environment, which can manifest as a host of symptoms such as persistent and spontaneous depression with changes in cognitive function. According to worldwide statistics, 50% of suicides each year occur during episodes of depression, and patients with MDD are 20 times more likely to commit suicide than the general population.",

      "abstract": "Motivation literally means 'to be driven to do something' and refers to processes dealing with the origin and maintenance of the target behavior. Lack of motivation happens to be a core negative symptom of schizophrenia, and it directly influences the functional outcome. Decreased motivation for treatment as well as for other activities and education are common for schizophrenic patients. Motivation can be looked at as a result of complex interaction between physiological processes and the social context factors. The role of underlying physiological processes is not clear so far, and only since recently has attracted the attention of researchers. Clinical data emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation in the cognitive recovery of schizophrenics who have problems with congruence between their behavior and motivating characteristics of the stimulus because of variety of interconnected mechanisms, like anticipation anhedonia, memory laps and problems with long-term memory concerning one's achievements in the past, the disordered mechanism of estimating the value of the task and the effort to accomplish it, and a number of other more complicated reasons.",

      "abstract": "Disabilities are complex, dynamic, multidimensional and also contested; one or more key functions of the organism can be affected so to diminish an individual�s freedom of expression and of action. The transition from an individual, medical perspective to a structural, social perspective was described as a shift from a medical model to a social model where individuals are more likely considered disabled by the society then by their own bodies. Disabilities represent a part of the human condition due to its bidirectional connection with poverty: the existence of disabilities can increase the risk of poverty, and poverty can increase the risk of disability. The experience of disability that results from the interaction of the state of health, personal factors and environmental factors varies greatly. Stress, anxiety or different unpleasant moments can cause a temporary decrease in salivary flow but a constant decrease can indicate the existence of a serious health problem. Xerostomia represents the subjective sensation of dry mouth. It can be accompanied by hyposalivation, an objective phenomenon but this is not always the case. Even if the patient declares the existence of xerostomia, this does not necessarily imply the existence of hyposalivation. Xerostomia can be determined by modifications in the oral cavity, as the sensitivity level to moistening, adverse reactions to certain drugs (anti-depressants, inhibitors of the conversion enzyme). The handicap, now called disability represents a special condition of the individual, reason why he must benefit of the support of the society and of those around him. Dental treatment in patients with psychiatric disabilities must consider the general and local involutive modifications, the existent overlay polypathologies that can influence the dental treatment. The study was conducted practically and included the direct interaction as part of the medical team and the registration of 145 patients presented on request with various types of psychological disorders, sometimes covered by the mask of somatic disorders, indicating a masked depression, or a physical depression, where the emotional condition of yesterday and today differ very much. Pointing out the role of the dentist in approaching patients with physical and psychical disabilities, motivating and making them aware of the necessity of adopting a proper oral hygiene for preventing oral disorders. The dramatic impact on the psyche and the well-chosen words stressed by the clinician increase patient awareness and motivation in order to make him collaborate during the treatment.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

This question has arisen repeatedly over the years, in part because of the apparent correspondence between the illnesses of depression and mania on the one hand, and the emotions of sadness and elation on the other. The latter, as transient mood states, can be triggered by events. If the illness depression is viewed as a kind of supersadness or the illness mania as superelation, then by extension one might assume that those discrete disorders can also be triggered by events. Making this assumption, physicians and patients alike often seek a causal connection between stressful events and sustained affective disorder. In an individual case it is impossible to prove or",

The symptoms are: A prodromal phase which lasts from 2 weeks to a few months and shows the usual schizophrenic pattern. First Phase.—Increasing perplexity and intense anxiety; incoherence; extreme restlessness; a \"blind drive for annihilation\" and suicidal tendencies; acrocyanosis, increased blood-pressure. Second Phase.—Motor restlessness changing to a more primitive pattern; consciousness becomes increasingly clouded; unusual hematopoietic changes of the blood; blood pressure falls; pulse is rapid and weak; pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light; reflexes are decreased; high elevation of temperature; pronounced cyanosis; petechial hemorrhages into the tissue; sudden respiratory death or vasomotor collapse. Autopsy Findings.—Negative except for petechial hemorrhages into the tissues, and transformation of the fatty bone marrow to the erythropoietic state. A theory of possible \"asthenic metabolic changes\" due to disturbances in the hormonal-vegetative system, and its practical application were discussed.",

      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

Symptoms of depression can be manifestations of either dementing or medical illnesses, both of which are common in the elderly. Psychosocial factors that are unique to the elderly may be etiologic in the genesis of depressive symptoms, but nevertheless require the clinician to fully assess each patient and treat as appropriate. Accurate treatment mandates a detailed history, often with collaboration with the family, and a thorough medical evaluation for other comorbid illnesses that may contribute to the patient's current presentation. The treatment of depressive symptoms in the elderly requires an understanding of both the origin of these symptoms and the proper treatment of the underlying disorder whether it is due to medical, dementing, psycho-social or melancholic factors.",

In a significant proportion of individuals, however, recovery may be impaired, leading to long-term pathological disturbances. The most common of these is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A range of other disorders may also be seen after trauma, and there is considerable overlap between PTSD symptoms and several other psychiatric conditions. Risk factors for PTSD include severe exposure to the trauma, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and a history of psychiatric illness. Although PTSD may resolve in the majority of cases, in some cases risk factors outweigh protective factors, and symptoms may persist for many years. PTSD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse, and with physical (somatization) symptoms. There is growing evidence that PTSD does not merely represent a normal response to stress, but rather is mediated by specific neurobiological dysfunctions.",

The exact pathology is not known; but it is generally accepted to be ‘soft tissue injury’. The same clinical syndrome can occur without a road accident. No one doubts the reality of the condition in the early stages when the symptoms and signs (of a ‘mechanical derangement’) are clear cut. As with other soft tissue injuries, most ‘heal’ within a usual time span; some take longer to heal; and some have persisting problems giving rise to chronic pain, restricted movements &/or a feeling of ‘instability’. In this latter group the physical signs are less obvious but are still present, if sought. Imaging is rarely relevant. The psychological reaction to any injury or illness will vary from individual to individual (the previous personality); or from time to time in the same individual. People with chronic pain may become depressed and may develop ‘excessive’ psychological reactions – often referred to as ‘chronic pain syndrome’ and, by some, as ‘abnormal illness behaviour’; this is exacerbated when litigation is involved with its attendant adversarial, confrontational approach which questions the ‘genuineness’ of both the patient and their symptoms and disability. Where symptom persist beyond the ‘usual’ time for healing, and are consistent with the (albeit subtle) physical signs found, there can be no grounds for arguing that they are nor related to the accident.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

His psychomotor development was physiologically normal and without complications. His intelligence and scholastic achievements are normal. The most extensive tests always give negative results. Only the electroencephalogram (EEG) may show disturbance, but not always. Typical losses of consciousness are reflected the EEG if it is a case of petit mal. But these EEG tracings, whether recorded during or between seizures, give no clues whatever to etiology. The child or adolescent is then treated symptomatically. He will be re-examined later. The subsequent course varies. Sometimes seizures or blackouts cease under the effects of treatment. In other cases, new seizures occur at more or less long intervals, so that treatment must be modified or intensified.

      "abstract": "The term \"illness\" implies a medical disease model, namely that symptoms or syndromes indicate an underlying organic disease - in the case of psychiatry a disorder of the brain. But no brain markers could be identified until today, which would indicate a psychiatric illness or in particular a certain psychiatric illness. Furthermore organic causes of a mental disorder are an exclusion criterion for a diagnosis of a mental disorder. For all these reasons all international classifications systems use the term \"disorder\" instead of \"illness\". Beyond the question if mental disorders are disorders of the brain one might challenge the concept of psychiatric diagnoses at all. Most diagnostic thresholds are arbitrary or imposed on pragmatic grounds. For a categorical diagnosis to be scientifically valid, clear symptom boundaries should separate it from other conditions. But this is rarely the case concerning psychiatric diagnoses. In many respects a dimensional approach would be much more appropriate than a categorical view. A dimensional approach would reflect the fact that mental problems are part of the human condition, which turn into psychiatric disorders when the affected individual cannot perform his or her social roles any longer. The personal, social and environmental factors that determine mental health and mental illness may be clustered conceptually around themes like the development and maintenance of healthy communities and each person's ability to deal with the social world and manage his or her life. All this would be much more helpful than the conceptualisation of mental disorders as brain diseases.",

      "abstract": "Both the limitations and the advantages of SCAN stem from the nature of the problems it attempts to solve. These problems are not specific to psychiatry but they are more obvious and more complex than many of those met elsewhere in medicine, largely because the most characteristic symptoms are subjective; known only because a person describes them. Observable signs do exist, such as autonomic arousal in someone describing a subjective feeling of anxiety, or evidence of concomitant activity in the cortex while describing auditory hallucinations. But the reported experience is often the only evidence available. The first and most basic problem, therefore, is to decide whether a symptom is present or absent. The second problem, an extension of the first, is to assess clinical severity.",

Fatigue may be the complaint for a broad differential diagnosis, including acute coronary syndrome, anemia, chronic inflammatory diseases, dehydration, hypoglycemia or other electrolyte derangements, adrenal insufficiency, a variety of infections, pulmonary disorders, medication side effects, and depression. These disorders are characterized by a lack of true muscular weakness on examination. True muscular weakness is not painful, and pain should guide the examiner to other etiologies such as fibromyalgia or polymyalgia rheumatica.",

The importance of altered mental status is yet further magnified by its prevalence, as one of the most common reasons to receive acute medical care. The term altered mental status, however, represents an especially complex constellation of symptoms, a label applied by clinicians that simultaneously consolidates and oversimplifies different patient concerns and clinical syndromes that can be due to disparate causes within and outside of the nervous system.[1] This complexity can provoke nearly as much confusion in clinicians as patients themselves.",

The divergence, but above all the analogies between hysterical symptoms and such limits are underlined, showing the frequency of succession with time, associations and transitional forms (\"somatisation disorder\" of the DSM III, psychogenic pain, and psychosomatic disorders termed \"psychofunctional\").",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

However, the subject is poorly covered in medical education. A major consequence is that the manifestations of the many sleep disorders now identified are likely to be misinterpreted as other clinical conditions of a physical or psychological nature, especially neurological or psychiatric disorders. To illustrate this problem, examples are provided of the various possible causes of sleep loss, poor quality sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of disturbed behaviour at night (parasomnias). All of these sleep disorders can adversely affect mental state and behaviour, daytime performance or physical health, the true cause of which needs to be recognised by clinicians to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. As conventional history taking in neurology and psychiatry pays little attention to sleep and its possible disorders, suggestions are made concerning the enquiries that could be included in history taking schedules to increase the likelihood that sleep disorders will be correctly identified.",

There is no such thing as a non‐physical illness. Asking whether emotions cause diseases, or diseases cause emotions, leads to many difficulties and is unprofitable. It is far more useful to ask about stimulus‐response relationships. There are more kinds of specificity relations in psychophysiology and psychosomatic medicine than are usually recognized, and the usual specificity statements in psychosomatic medicine are not concerned with I‐R or S‐R specificity.

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "abstract": "Syncope is a common presenting complaint in Neurology clinics or Emergency departments, but its causes are sometimes difficult to diagnose. Apart from vasovagal attacks, other benign, neurally mediated syncopes include \"situational\" syncopes, which occur after urination, coughing, swallowing, or defecation.A healthy 42-year-old male patient presented to the neurology clinic with a long history of faints triggered by spontaneous laughter, especially after funny jokes. Physical and neurological examination, and electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging were unremarkable. There was no evidence to suggest cardiogenic causes, epilepsy, or cataplexy and a diagnosis of laughing syncope was made.Laughter-induced syncope is usually a single event in the majority of cases, but may present as recurrent attacks as in our case. Some cases occur in association with underlying neurological conditions. Prognosis is good in the case of neurally mediated attacks. Laughter may not be recognized by physicians as a cause of syncope, which may lead to unnecessary investigations or misdiagnosis, and affect patients' quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The introduction of potent physical and pharmacological therapies for psychotic conditions has increased the need for accurate diagnosis, not only in terms of assigning a patient to the diagnostic category but of assessing the various trends which may result in a very mixed symptomatology. Therapy, be it physical, pharmacological, or psychotherapeutic directed against one or the other of these components may frequently intensify other symptomatology. A suitable combination of anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs plus the use of E.C.T. when indicated is necessary in the management of such cases. In the author's judgment this mixed symptomatology frequently results from the influence of personality trends and conflicts and particularly in these mixed states psychotherapeutic aid must also be included. In the words of Jules Masserman: “Even frankly psychotic behaviour patterns, whether depressive or schizoid, are not as sometimes inferred-merely shapeless fragments from a personality shattered by some hypothetical ‘mental disease’. On the contrary, the psychosis itself is an integrated syndrome which however socially deviant is adaptively operated at all levels from the physiologic to the most abstrusely symbolic.” (3)",

Each is considered a disorder, diagnosed with a distinct set of diagnostic criteria. Spectrum conveys the idea that they are somehow similar to each other. Such similarity could be defined on purely clinical grounds or at the level of disease mechanism and aetiology. It is this tension of distinctiveness and similarity that makes the scientific study of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders challenging. The concept of the schizophrenia spectrum can be traced back to Bleuler and his book Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias. 1 The schizophrenias are characterised by significant heterogeneity of signs and symptoms, disease course and outcome. This gives rise to various clinical subtypes and to variants defined by a shorter duration of illness. Most importantly, the outcome of the schizophrenias ranges from long-term disability to",

Unfortunately, it often strikes the individual at the height of his productivity. The first symptom of the condition may be a decrease in expected level of functioning, and thus the disease may be very closely tied to the patient's work or professional status. It is important to note that the symptoms that usher in the process of dementia differ little from those that occur in normal people who are exhausted, anxious, or under severe pressure.

Common mental health problems often present atypically in older individuals; and loss of physical abilities, financial resources, and family and friends can challenge even the most resilient amongst older people. As part of comprehensive diagnostic workup, neuroimaging such as non-contrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are recommended for all older adults with significant cognitive deficits, new-onset mood or psychotic symptoms accompanied by subtle neurological symptoms, or general physical symptoms.",

Amongst the reasons for this are high rates of co-occurrence of different diagnostic constructs, which themselves are often polythetic in nature. People who meet criteria for a diagnostic construct may have little or even no clinical features in common. These diagnostic constructs rely on people meeting the diagnostic criteria having similar qualities to their condition such as similar likelihoods of outcomes/responses to treatments. These highly variable clinical pictures are seen even when clear disease is involved, such as the dementias. General medical diagnostic constructs can also display highly variable clinical pictures even when clear disease processes have been identified. Polythetic diagnostic criteria decided upon by expert committees are also used for general medical diagnostic constructs which can also result in people meeting the same diagnostic criteria having little in common in their clinical pictures. Co-occurrence is also common in general medicine. Psychological formulation does not have to address the issue of variable clinical pictures. Both symptom-based and dimensional classifications can depict variable clinical pictures more accurately than diagnostic constructs but there are pragmatic issues such as suitability for brief appointments or emergency work.",

      "title": "Acute psychotic symptoms caused by overlapping central nervous system pathologies: a case report",
      "abstract": "Background: In some medical cases, psychotic symptoms can be part of the clinical picture, and sometimes it can even be the only clinical appearance of the medical condition. Psychotic disorders secondary to organic pathologies affecting the central nervous system are called psychotic disorders due to a general medical condition. While some of these secondary causes can easily be detected by laboratory and imaging methods, anamnesis or neurological examination (substance use, trauma, and tumors), others are often overlooked in the presence of rare medical conditions (autoimmune disease and viral encephalitis), when laboratory and examination findings are not clear and psychiatric symptoms are in the foreground. Case Presentation: In this case, we tried to reveal the differential diagnosis and treatment processes of a patient who was admitted to the emergency department with psychotic symptoms, such as agitation, aggression, and paranoid delusions, and was admitted to the psychiatry clinic after an urgent medical evaluation. After his admission to the psychiatry clinic, the medical evaluation of the patient was re-evaluated in detail due to memory and orientation deterioration, and as a result, clinical pictures such as Hashimoto’s encephalopathy, herpes encephalitis, and epileptic seizures were found to be together in the patient. As a matter of fact, both general medical and psychiatric statuses of the patient improved with the application of low doses and short-term antipsychotic treatment for psychiatric symptoms together with the treatment for this underlying general medical condition. Conclusion: Since the treatment of psychiatric symptoms caused by secondary medical factors is quite different from the treatment of primary psychiatric disorders, it is important to make full medical evaluations, especially in patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms for the first time or presenting with emergency psychiatric symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

Den overveiende del av de foreliggende epidemiologiske data kan imidlertid tolkes i retning av at stressfaktorer er av betydning for periodontal sykdom. Flere undersøkelser viser at god mestringsevne overfor stresspåvirkning er forebyggende med hensyn til utvikling av sykdom.",

Chronic medical illness is a significant risk factor for the development of an anxiety disorder, and the prevalence rate of anxiety disorders among youths with chronic medical illnesses is higher compared to their healthy counterparts. Anxiety disorders may develop secondary to predisposing biological mechanisms related to a child's specific medical illness, as a response to being ill or in the hospital, a threatening environment, as a result of other genetic and psychological factors, or as a combination of all these factors. Additionally, exposure to physical pain early in one's life and/or frequent painful medical procedures are correlated with fear and anxiety during subsequent procedures and treatments, and may lead to medical nonadherence and other comorbidities. Anxiety disorders can have serious consequences in children/adolescents with chronic and/or life-limiting medical illnesses. Therefore, proper identification and treatment of anxiety disorders is necessary and may improve not only psychiatric symptoms but also physical symptoms. Behavioral and cognitive methods as well as psychotropic medications are used to treat anxiety disorders in pediatric patients. We will review current treatments for anxiety in children/adolescents with medical illnesses and propose future research directions.",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

In studies of build crucial experiments or dramatic deviations from the normal are rare, leaving the alternative of comparisons between averages for moderate abnormalities.

      "abstract": "Psychosomatic disorders in children and adolescents is a topic that covers a wide variety of illnesses and one which is difficult if not impossible to define accurately. In general, chronic emotional states, often nonspecific, serve as strong contributors to the development of a physical illness. The particular illness is often dictated by varying degrees of biological predisposition in one physiological system—i.e., such a predisposition in the respiratory system may lead to asthma or in the gastrointestinal system to ulcerative colitis. In some cases the biological factor is large and the emotional factor minimal, while in other cases the reverse is true. In the early days of research in psychosomatic disorders it was widely believed that each disorder was accompanied by certain specific emotional problems. Further study has shown this is not true. It was also felt that many, if not most of these disorders could be cured by psychotherapy, and this also has proven to be a fallacy. We have moved more and more to the team approach. Since both psyche and soma are involved, more than one specialist is usually required. In children and adolescents this may involve a child psychiatrist, a pediatrician, an allergist or gastroenterologist, a social worker and a psychologist. It requires time and patience to form an effective and smoothly functioning team in which all members respect one another's potential contribution. Some examples of team operation are presented and some of the problems outlined. In addition, there is attention given to the special problems of the adolescent and also the child with chronic nonspecific physical complaints as well as the child who requires hospitalization.",

The reasons for the poor understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders include the difficulty in sampling the human brain and CNS, and there are no pure animal models for depression or bipolar disorder because the human and animal brains are very different.

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

In the writer's own case psychosis eventually encroached after real persecution, severe life stress and enhanced arousal and was prompted by an ascription of high distinctiveness to self and a low distinctiveness to others. The impact of coincidences generated and confirmed an interpretation of an externallocus of control. Abnormality ('illness') was reflected in a massive escalation of confirmation blas. It is argued that psychosis has its own intrinsic motivation; that life events must be understood in a developmental context; that cognitive factors, often critical, can sometimes be tied to emotional determinants and that gross damage to the self concept, with consequences for spiritual life, plays a causal role in psychosis. A genetic fragility, which biases ongoing emotional and cognitive life, is nonetheless strongly indicated.",

      "abstract": "There is little written in the geriatric literature about the concept of psychological frailty which encompasses cognitive, mood, and motivational components. The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

While conversion disorder can present clinically in multiple ways, from nonepileptic seizures to psychogenic blindness to upper‐ and/or lower‐extremity weakness with or without significant gait disturbance, these clinical manifestations all share in common the presence of functionally impairing motor and/or sensory symptoms that exist in the absence of a specific identifiable structural cause, and are assessed to be either caused by or propagated by emotional (and therefore neurochemical) factors.",

      "title": "Symptomatology and Management of Acute Grief",
      "abstract": "At first glance, acute grief would not seem to be a medical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. Bereavement or the sudden cessation of social interaction seems to be of special interest because it is often cited among the alleged psychogenic factors in psychosomatic disorders. The enormous increase in grief reactions due to war casualties, furthermore, demands an evaluation of their probable effect on the mental and physical health of our population. The points to be made in this paper are as follows: i. Acute grief is a definite syndrome with psychological and somatic symptomatology. 2. This syndrome may appear immediately after a crisis; it may be delayed; it may be exaggerated or apparently al)sent. 3. In place of the typical syndrome there may appear distorted pictures, each of which represents one special aspect of the grief syndrome. 4. By appropriate techniques these distorted pictures can be successfully transformed into a normal grief reaction with resolution. Our observations comprise tot patients. Included are (i) psychoneurotic patients who lost a relative during the course of treatment, (2) relatives of patients who uied in the hospital, (3) bereaved disaster victims (Cocoanut Grove Fire) and their close relatives, ( ) relatives of members of the armed forces.",

      "abstract": "There are many patients with chronic pain who are referred from each of the clinical fields to the department of psychosomatic medicine. Various psychosocial stress factors participate in the onset of chronic pain. Psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, anger, depression, hypersensitivity, or irritation, are often related to the onset of chronic pain and change the state of illness. Chronic pain of the musculoskeletal system is often a pathologic reaction against the stress. Because a correlation between physical symptoms and psychological stress factors has been observed, chronic pain can be regarded as a representative form of psychosomatic disease. To improve efficacy in the medical treatment or psychotherapy, it is important to understand the psychosocial condition of chronic pain through sufficient history taking or appropriate psychological tests. For the pharmacological treatment of such chronic pain modified with psychosomatic factors, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be more effective than general analgesics or physical therapy. Holistic and specialized approaches, such as cognitive therapy or behavioral therapy, may be necessary for the treatment of chronic pain related to improper recognition, obsessive ideas or misunderstanding of the problems.",

The neuroanatomy remains poorly defined but three levels seem likely: a) a cortical level; b) a bulbar, or effector, level; and 3) a synkinetic, or integrative, level probably at or near the hypothalamus. Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

A hierarchy moving from feelings through emotions, moods, and affective state to temperament involves increasing complexity in terms of state of mind and usually to an increasing duration of that state. Delusion involves abnormal beliefs that arise in the context of disturbed judgements and an altered experience of reality. Depersonalisation and derealisation are assumed to arise from a disruption in the functions of consciousness to create amnesia, dissociative identity disorder and depersonalisation disorder.

      "abstract": "Deaths occurring in police custody frequently raise public suspicion and concern, often prompting allegations of abuse or misconduct. Such cases attract intense scrutiny, necessitating thorough forensic investigation to establish the true cause of death. However, not all custodial deaths result from physical trauma or foul play; some may be attributed to natural causes, including undiagnosed or unmanaged medical conditions. This case study focuses on the sudden demise of a 57-year-old male detainee who succumbed to an intracerebral haemorrhage while in custody. The individual had a known history of long-standing hypertension, a condition that significantly increases the risk of spontaneous brain haemorrhage. Despite initial concerns about possible custodial violence, a comprehensive medico-legal autopsy and detailed histopathological examination revealed no signs of external or internal injuries suggestive of trauma or assault. Instead, the findings conclusively pointed to a natural death due to hypertensive cerebrovascular disease. This case underscores the critical role of forensic pathology in differentiating between natural and unnatural causes of death in custodial settings. It also reinforces the importance of objective scientific investigation to uphold justice, ensure institutional accountability, and maintain public trust in the medico-legal process. Clear, evidence-based conclusions are essential for addressing public concerns and safeguarding the rights of both the deceased and the custodial authorities.",

      "title": "Diagnosis 2.0 Are Mental Illnesses Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes? A Major Challenge for the DSM-V Committees as They Revise the Diagnostic \"Bible\" of Psychiatric Disorders Is to Determine Whether Mental Illnesses Are Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes",
      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

      "title": "Deterioration",
      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

The 1970s witnessed an \"epidemic\" of dissociative disorder, particularly DID, which may have reflected enthusiasm for the diagnosis more than its actual prevalence. Traditionally, the dissociative disorders have been attributed to trauma and other psychological stress, but the existing evidence favoring this hypothesis is plagued by poor methodology. Prospective studies of traumatized individuals reveal no convincing cases of amnesia not attributable to brain insult, injury, or disease. Treatment generally involves recovering and working through ostensibly repressed or dissociated memories of trauma; at present, there are few quantitative or controlled outcome studies. Experimental studies are few in number and have focused largely on state-dependent and implicit memory. Depersonalization disorder may be in line for the next \"epidemic\" of dissociation.",

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

It is a challenge for psychiatrists and other physicians to accurately diagnose and treat the patient. There are patients who insist that they have a medical problem and whose claim is not confirmed by physical examination or laboratory testing. The psychological need to have a physical complaint is the psychiatric disorder for this group of patients. At the other end of this physical–psychiatric continuum are patients, without obvious physical discomfort to suggest a medical condition, who may be misdiagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder because their presentation is atypical, or their complaints are primarily in the domain of how they feel or how they think. Physicians' understanding of the role of culture and cultural biases toward mental illness and of the physical components of mood and anxiety disorders results in a consideration of a psychiatric diagnosis. This process occurs even in the absence of the patient's complaint of psychological symptoms. Instances in which patients' physical complaints are parts of mood and anxiety disorders may cause diagnostic confusion for physicians who consider only medical diagnoses. When it comes to the diagnostic consideration of a psychiatric versus a medical condition we know that it is not either/or but it often is both.",

The etiologies are diverse, if not legion, and there is poor correlation with symptoms, laboratory study findings, and pathological findings.

The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

They can spread rapidly by apparent visual transmission, may be aggravated by a prominent emergency or media response, and frequently resolve after patients are separated from each other and removed from the environment in which the outbreak began. Physicians should consider this diagnosis when faced with a cluster of unexplained acute illness.",

These impacts might exist only in the short term but could sustain for the long term and lead to serious psychological issues, stress disorder or adaptation disorder, or even psychological disorder. Serious cases might even suicide or hurt others. Therefore, carrying out psychological intervention and therapy in an effective and prompt manner has significant importance.",

On the other hand, dereism can be found in neuroses or personality syndromes, a finding that may indicate its multidimensional connotation. In the present article, while dereism has been appraised from psychoanalytic and cognitive viewpoints, it has been tried to delineate some of its valuable aspects, as well, which may be ignored clinically during routine psychiatric evaluation, counseling or psychotherapeutic approaches.",

The institution of medicine holds absolute authority over what is considered “natural” and “normal” in mental health and creates stigma. Disclosure has historically been discussed as a remedy but is limited according to social identities as well as determinants of health. Disclosure of mental illness as a disability can be problematic in workplaces. Experiences of sanism, or discrimination based on perceived level of sanity, are common.

You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

The content of delusions varies from patient to patient, and this content may or may not be congruent with the individual's mood. The delusions of individuals with dementia are most often paranoid or persecutory; they are also simple, as a high level of cognitive functioning seems to be required in order to elaborate complex delusions.

This chapter describes each theory's basic concepts and assumptions, theoretical limitations and advantages, and implications for treating or preventing mental illness. According to stress theory, when events and strains accumulate in people's lives, they can overwhelm people's psychosocial resources and abilities to cope and then generate symptoms of psychological disorder. Labeling theory picks up at this point and suggests that frequent, severe, or highly visible symptoms or symptoms exhibited by those with little social prestige or power, can launch a victimizing process. Societal reactions to symptoms may result in the person's receiving a formal psychiatric diagnosis, becoming hospitalized, and, ultimately, accepting a mental patient identity.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

In patients who suffer from multiple pain types or regions, or in whom there coexists abnormal perception of different modes of sensory stimulation, documenting clinical data using only verbal descriptors can be overwhelming. Historically, large portions of the autonomic nervous system have been thought of as only being responsible for the creation of involuntary physiological responses to acute, stressful or noxious stimuli.",

In his proposed concept of mental illness, he includes alcoholism, drug dependence, and anxiety neurosis. He excludes social adjustment reactions, character disorders, and some other conditions because, he presumes, these occur with intact neurophysiological function and are produced primarily by psychosocial variables. Anxiety neurosis may indeed, as Dr Ludwig implies, arise from brain dysfunction, but in modern textbooks of psychiatry, its cause is usually attributed to adverse psychosocial experience. Character disorders may also arise from brain dysfunction, but their cause is often attributed to psychosocial experience. Since presuming is allowed, we could presume that chronic psychosocial stress leads to persisting electrochemical dysfunction in the brain, and that this brain dysfunction then continues to produce",

The phenomenon of medically unexplained symptoms cannot simply be classified into one or a few diagnostic categories, but must be regarded as an expression of a basic mechanism by which people may respond to stressors as in the cases of depression and anxiety. Somatization disorder and related disorders must thus be considered to possess a spectrum of severity. In this chapter, the focus will be on the chronic and multisymptomatic forms.",

      "title": "[Induced abortion: shock and after-effects?].",
      "abstract": "It is generally agreed that the incidence of serious psychic side effects after abortion is very low. Most women undergoing abortion appear to experience nothing more than temporary depression that spontaneously resolves, and some surveys suggest that the psychic state may be improved under some circumstances after abortion. A minority of women, however, suffer considerably after abortion and their experiences, as elsewhere in psychopathology, shed light on the less obvious experience of other women. The author uses case studies to illuminate the dynamic and subconscious effects of abortion, which are revealed in attitudes, symptoms, or comments. Whether or not a woman seeks an abortion, the very fact of carrying an unwanted child can be enough to provoke psychic symptoms. If the partner abandons the woman because of her pregnancy, the blow may be even more strongly felt, resulting in a mixture of pain and aggression. The symptoms and the connection with a past abortion may remain unrecognized until a subsequent, desired pregnancy. Symptoms after an abortion may include frigidity, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pain, or poor tolerance of contraception desired at the conscious level. The manifestations are not specific and may occur after childbirth or at any other time. No matter how well accepted abortion seems to be by society, it is different from any other surgical procedure and it may therefore have some aftereffects. Social acceptance may provide some comfort but it is not enough to compensate for personal conflicts. Sometimes the conflict is expressed in the sexual relationship with the partner, who is considered responsible for the abortion. The effects of an abortion on a relationship depend in part of how satisfactory the relationship was before the pregnancy. Repeated requests for abortion may result from a woman's intrapsychic conflicts. It is well known that the desire to be pregnant is not always accompanied by a desire for motherhood. Pregnancy may be an expression of narcissistic need or a means of defense against feelings of unworthiness or doubts about identity. Guilt feelings may be increased by ambivalence about the abortion, by religious beliefs, or even by the desire for children at a later time. Feelings of guild over an abortion are often provoked by society. The practitioner can play an important role in identifying women at risk of serious psychic sequelae by listening attentively to their manifestations of ambivalence and distress.",

      "abstract": "Cerebral origin of relapsing paroxysmal abdominal pains is discussed in the light of six case histories, other personal observations and the literature. The pains are assumed to be due to locally limited epileptic discharges in areas of the cortex where the digestive tract is represented. When the neuronal discharges reach other brain formations, multisymptomatic, partial or generalized epileptic seizures occur. In such cases, therefore, the abdominal symptomatology is either a first stage or a rudiment of a more complex course of attack, and should not be considered as the expression of a particular form of epilepsy that might be termed abdominal epilepsy. Difficulties regarding differential diagnosis ensue in the case of migraine with abdominal symptomatology. The latter should be taken into account when relapsing attacks of abdominal pain, which cannot be explained gastroenterologically, persist for hours and alternate with headache. In case of doubt, a family history of migraine confirms the diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "This review focuses on the differentiation of schizophrenia in the setting of adult psychiatry from neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD's) and psychosis due to other medical conditions (PDMC). Psychotic disorders in early adulthood are most frequently diagnosed with the schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders. However, they may be the manifestation of neurologic, endocrine or immunologic disease. Individuals with NDD's such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) may also present initially in adulthood. Therefore it is not uncommon that the psychiatrist is the first physician to assess a psychotic patient with underlying medical illness or a NDD. Failure to identify the underlying cause will delay appropriate management. Overdiagnosis of primary psychiatric disorders may be misleading in planning the treatment, as evidence-based treatment algorithms relevant to psychosis are intended for primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, and symptomatic treatment may result in unnecessary exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Exclusion of other medical conditions and NDD's is essential before establishing a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Here, we report the case of a 63-year-old woman affected by abnormal, excessive and involuntary reactions to harmless and unexpected sensory stimuli, compatible with the diagnosis of hyperekplexia. It is a pathology that involves the glycinergic system on a hereditary basis and, even if genetic proof compatible with the diagnosis is not present in this case, the fact that an aunt on her father’s side manifested the same disorders supports the clinical suspicion. From an early age, clinical history shows anomalous motor manifestations, initially framed as a form of focal epilepsy or ordinary disorders of the mood sphere, later excluded by the lack of effectiveness of a targeted therapy. Despite this, intellectual, psychological and socio-emotional development was regular. The manifestations, present throughout childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in moderate entity, worsened after the age of 50 perhaps due to hormonal changes. The presence of consequent anxiety and depression has compromised her quality of life, and in order to improve it therapies were resorted which, however, involve cognitive-attention deficits. No diagnostic test has confirmed the diagnosis, although some scars in brain areas involved in the control of reactions are elements favorable to the condition in genetically predisposed subjects. Therapies currently in use attenuate the motor symptomatology without resolving it and cause side effects in the psychological and cognitive sphere. In this case, we want to highlight the difficulty of diagnosing a very rare genetic condition, still not well known and presenting symptoms which are easily confused with other more common diseases, in the absence of clinical-diagnostic tools at the present time.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The onset of HD is insidious. Most clinicians refrain from making a diagnosis of either adult or juvenile onset HD until motor signs are present. The motor signs in JHD may differ from those seen in the classical adult form of the condition. Children and young people from HD families may present with behavioural or emotional problems, and a question of whether these are part of the onset of JHD or have an alternative explanation arises. Some families, in this circumstance, have described this as a distressing time as they perceive that professionals are not listening to their concerns, or are even blaming their parenting skills for their child's problems.A problem has arisen because the genetic test is sometimes described as 'diagnostic'. In fact the interpretation of the result depends on the clinical context in which the test was done. If unequivocal neurological abnormalities consistent with HD are present, then an abnormal result is seen as confirming a clinical diagnosis. If an abnormal test result is reported in an asymptomatic person, then the same genetic test is considered to be predictive. The problem comes when a child or young person has problems which may or may not be due to JHD. Unless the test results show an extremely large increase in CAG repeat length, an abnormal result will not resolve that difficulty.Clinicians need to continue to use the genetic test cautiously in children and young people with behavioural and emotional problems alone, but must also be sensitive to the negative perceptions that this may generate for the parent and other carers. At present additional clinical information may be obtained from standard imaging and neuropsychological assessments, and in the future analysis of other biomarkers currently in development may help in the assessment of this clinical problem.",

Behavioral, psychological, environmental, physiologic, metabolic, and genetic explanations are just some of the possibilities identified as contributing to or causing obesity; yet, each explanation encounters controversy and no one explanation has gained unanimous consensus. Ideally, once a patient has had weight loss surgery (WLS), he or she loses excess weight in a controlled, healthy manner and complies with all the components of the recommended bariatric treatment program; sometimes, however, patients \"modify\" their post-surgical instructions. The ability to identify program modifications may be initially camouflaged if patients continue to lose weight and their laboratory values and other medical tests indicate that their weight loss status is smoothly progressing. On the surface it may seem that all is well, but appearances may be deceiving. A dysfunctional relationship with food and other substances of abuse, such as alcohol, may be lurking underneath the surface of what passes as treatment success, and this condition, left untreated, may persist or evolve to a cross-addiction, also known as an addiction transfer or a substitute addiction. A cross-addiction occurs when an individual exchanges one compulsive behavior for another compulsive behavior, such as when a weight loss surgery patient is no longer overeating or bingeing, but instead is abusing alcohol. An incisive and comprehensive nursing assessment that includes how, why, and in what manner the WLS patient is losing weight needs to be conducted to uncover established or developing cross-addictive behaviors. Clearly, assuming that any weight loss is better than no weight loss is a dangerous proposition when the mechanisms of how this weight loss occurred are not identified.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

      "abstract": "Late-life depression is highly heterogeneous in clinical presentation, and is also commonly resistant to treatment. While some cases are a continuation of the chronic course of illness beginning in early adulthood, a large number of persons will have a first episode of depression in later life following alife-time of relatively good mental health. While incident cases of major depression tend to decrease with age, the number of persons with clinically significant depressive symptomatology rises. À distinction has often been made between early-onset and late-onset depression, however, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest these are distinct clinical entities. On the other hand observations from a fifteen year prospective population study of psychiatric disorder in the elderly (the ESPRIT Study) supports the alternative idea that depression may be divided into sub-types according to postulated aetiology; for example depression with a strong genetic component, related to hormonal changes, the consequence of trauma; the result of cerebrovascular insult. Exposure to these putative causes may be more common at different points in the life span, thus suggesting age-differences. Our research further suggests that even cases of depression appearing for the first time in late-life, may be initially triggered by risk factors occurring decades before. Our findings suggest, for example, that childhood events may lead to changes in the biology of stress management, which continue throughout life, increasing vulnerability to depression and persisting even after effective treatment of symptoms. Together these observations suggest it may be more meaningful to classify depression in the elderly according to probable principle precipitating factors rather than age.",

These are generated by treatment and rehabilitation measures, pensions and loss of working hours. The cause of pain is multifocal and frequently remains unclear. It is not the etiology of back pain that has changed in the last 20 years, but its rate of assessment and treatment options. According to the relevant literature, treatment of chronic back pain will most probably only succeed using multimodal concepts that have to consider medical/somatic and psychosocial aspects and be based on scientific training experience. Pain assessment is based on common legal and certification standards. However, typical decision and rating problems result from the difficulty of objective medical registration and grading of pain. Medical certification may often be complicated by co-morbidities such as somatic pain attacks, fibromyalgia, depression or anxiety. These cases necessitate close cooperation with other medical specialities.",

      "abstract": "Chronic therapy-resistant low back pain is a major problem in medical care. In Germany there are many millions concerned, and the treatment expenses range at the top. Many of these patients underwent non-successful operations at the vertebral column and suffered a long-lasting odyssey of therapies before they are treated psychosomatically for the first time. Chronic low back pain is a disease including social, psychological as well as physiological aspects, and not only a problem of bones, muscles, or intervertebral disks. The problem is similar to that of fibromyalgia. On the basis of 9,000 case reports obtained during psychosomatic orthopedic treatment, character structures, unsolved problems of life and repressed emotional disturbances such as anger, jealousy, fear, and mourning could be identified as major psychosomatic risk factors for chronic low back pain. There is a high coincidence with other psychosomatically influenced diseases such as gastric and duodenal ulcera, asthma bronchiale, migraine with depressions, anxiety disorders, character neuroses, and narcissistic and other structural disturbances of the self. Exclusively somatic treatments without considering the existential situation and psychological methods hold the danger of a symptom shifting. The inpatient treatment from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ('Tagesklinik') with a combination of medical, physiotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic methods promotes a social training that counteracts the increasing constrictions in the accustomed life surroundings caused by low back pain. Chronic low back pain is an 'illness of the upright walk' in an anthropological, ethical sense. Considering low back pain as a strictly somatic disease is a modern myth of a medical treatment without existential understanding of human illness. It provokes failure of treatment and an enhancement of treatment cost.",

Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

      "title": "Mild traumatic brain injury: a neuropsychiatric approach to diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment.",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common occurrence in the United States, with an estimated incidence exceeding 1 million injuries per year. Cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physical impairments are common sequelae of TBI and may, in a significant minority of patients, persist well into the late period following injury. The etiology of these symptoms in individuals with mild TBI is controversial, with hypotheses of postconcussive symptom formation variously ascribing greater or lesser weight to neural damage, pre- and/or post-injury psychological or psychiatric factors, somatization, malingering, or some combination of these. Some of these hypotheses reflect biases common to medicolegal or compensation-related contexts, whereas others are derived from recent neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies. Studies of the latter sort suggest that many of the typical postconcussive symptoms are associated with neurobiological dysfunction in one or more areas of the central nervous system. Whether these symptoms constitute a postconcussive syndrome per se is debatable. Instead, it may be more accurate to describe them as commonly co-occurring symptoms rather than as a syndromal sequela of TBI. The present review addresses these issues including the epidemiology and course of recovery from mild TBI and the validity of the postconcussive syndrome. Suggestions regarding the assessment and treatment of individuals with post-concussive symptoms are offered.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "Depressive syndromes and dementia are the most frequent psychiatric disorders in the elderly. Reactive depressive syndromes can be associated with the restriction of social competence due to increasing multi-morbidity, loneliness, social isolation, the consequences of retirement, interpersonal conflicts, and the loss of partners or close relatives. Endogenous depressive syndromes in the elderly are frequently combined with diffuse and changing somatic complaints, psychomotor restlessness and agitation. Furthermore, depressive syndromes can be caused by somatic illness, degenerative disorders, other organic diseases or certain drugs. The presence of simultaneously occurring somatic illness, positive family history, certain personality traits, and severity of disease could exert an adverse influence on clinical outcome. Medical treatment should consider the special pharmacological features of old age, and should be combined with psychotherapy as well as a close involvement of the relatives.",

They are conceptualized as the human psyche’s way of coping with intolerable circumstances—a means of escape to assure survival, no matter what the price. Depersonalization disorder (DPD) is classified by modern American psychiatry within the dissociative disorders, but its traumatic causes are more highly variable than those encountered in more severe dissociative disorders. Not only childhood trauma, but also later severe stress, frightening episodes of other mental illness, and even isolated drug use can precipitate the condition. In some cases of depersonalization disorder, there is even no apparent cause or trigger.",

A chronic illness has a lengthy duration, uncertain outcome, and unpredictable episodes, often with intrusive symptoms and intermittent or progressive disability. Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

Some children may have persistent physical discomfort which can lead to debilitating impact on their academic and social functioning. These children seek repeated medical consultations and are usually subjected to unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures. It is extremely important to understand that emotional factors can contribute to the development as well as maintenance of impairing physical symptoms. There is scientific evidence for the association of anxiety and functional somatic symptoms in children. The diagnostic category which was previously called somatoform disorders is now included in somatic symptom disorders. The main feature of the somatic symptom disorders is the excessive concern with somatic symptoms. These children usually have high level of anxiety. Detailed clinical examination and investigations will not reveal any abnormalities to explain the symptoms. The somatic symptom disorders are common in childhood. Cognitive behavioural therapy by experts in child guidance, will relieve the somatic symptoms related to anxiety and stress. If not intervened at the earliest, the persistent physical symptoms associated with emotional stress will cause significant functional disability in childhood. Unnecessary invasive medical interventions cause more agony to the child. These children also have high risk for developing anxiety disorders and depressive disorders in young adulthood. Hence, early intervention using cognitive behavioural techniques should be provided to all children with somatic symptom disorders, which will definitely improve their quality of life.",

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

We describe an unusual form of palinacousis resulting from acute lobar intracerebral hemorrhage.A 70-year-old right-handed white man with history of hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation developed a rare form of palinacousis, on which he hears the previous speaker's voice on the current speaker's speech due to right parietal intracranial hemorrhage. Cranial imaging revealed right parietal intracranial hemorrhage likely secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hypertension. Extensive workup and thorough clinical examination ruled out dementia, psychosis, seizure, or other behavioral disorders. The condition gradually improved without any specific intervention.Abnormality in auditory processing due to intracranial lesions affecting auditory cortical projections causes a variety of symptoms that mimic other conditions such as psychotic hallucinations, and ictal and postictal behavioral changes. Thorough characterization with detailed examination and workup may help in distinguishing one from the other. A rare form of palinacousis may occur after unilateral nondominant parietal lesion. The condition is self-limiting and requires no specific management. Ruling out seizure disorder or psychiatric condition may prevent unnecessary workup and treatment.",

      "abstract": "This chapter addresses some of the issues relating to the evaluation of psychiatric drugs. The aim of therapy is to restore 'health' or to prevent its breakdown. Doctors, including psychiatrists, seldom question this goal to which, indeed, most dedicate their working life. The behavioural abnormality may be phobic avoidance or a compulsive ritual or it may be a specific act such as suicide in the context of severe depression. Symptoms in psychiatry are psychological but physical symptoms may also be prominent, especially in anxiety and depression. Pious platitudes abound concerning the usefulness of non-systematic clinical observations. The clinician's solution to this problem is to use as his working standard, not a formal diagnosis, but an informal formulation. The usual design is the parallel-groups design where patients are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatments. Cogent reasons are needed not to use this standard approach.",

The symptoms may be primarily psychological, such as misery, indecisiveness, irritability, inability to concentrate, or insomnia. They may be mainly physical, and the patient may present with one or more of a bewildering number of somatic complaints, often blaming those for his change in mood (Watts, 1957). Pain is a common and diagnostically puzzling presenting symptom of depression and other psychiatric disorders (Walters, 1961). It may take the form of generalized or poorly localized aches and pains, often associated with a feeling of tension, or it may be sharply delimited (Critchley, 1935). This form of localized pain may so dominate the symptomatology that the patient is referred by his general practitioner to a variety of specialists, who may perform a series of special investigations or even exploratory operations. Clearly, every effort must be made to exclude organic disease, even if positive signs of psychiatric illness are recognized, as an organic disease can obviously co-exist with a psychiatric one. In spite of thorough investigation, there will remain a proportion of patients in whom no lesion can be found to account for their symptoms.",

The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether.

An important portion of the history in a primary care evaluation is the psychiatric history and the mental status examination. When evaluating a patient for mental or emotional disorders, history is truly everything. Often, the practitioner must ask specific questions to assess the presence of common mental disorders in order to supplement other information or because the patient does not recognize or does not volunteer the symptoms. Casting ones net for the symptoms of common mental disorders, including the category of anxiety disorders, is extremely helpful to fully assess a patient’s emotional and physical status. Disorders that comorbidly occur may further complicate matters, especially if common symptoms are shared. For example, shared symptoms of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder include worrying, poor concentration, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and somatic concerns. An appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan can be instituted only after the clinical symptoms and signs are fully recognized and evaluated. The information in this book is applicable to evaluations of adult patients, age 18 years or older, although sections may be applicable to younger patients. The information is based on scholarly information supported by research and practical suggestions based on cumulative clinical experiences of the authors.",

Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

      "title": "Focused Neuroregulation in the Treatment and Prevention of Mental and Physical Illness",
      "abstract": "Despite the enormous strides that have been made in neuroscience, the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders remains unclear. Consequently, various forms of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and neuromodulatory therapy continue to be applied without a clear understanding of what pathological process is being treated. However, an emerging hypothesis contends that psychiatric symptoms are the consequence of pathological hyperactivity in symptom-related circuits in the brain. According to the Multi-Circuit Neuronal Hyperexcitability (MCNH) Hypothesis of Psychiatric Disorders, persistent firing in anxiety circuits causes persistent feelings of anxiety; persistent firing in depressive circuits causes persistent feelings of depression; persistent firing in cognitive circuits causes ruminative and obsessive thoughts; etc… This pathological circuit-specific hyperactivity is believed to be caused by an inherent failure of the neurological system to self-regulate when perturbed by a psychological, emotional, or biological stressor. Based on this hypothesis, it would not be unreasonable to think that psychiatric symptoms, irrespective of which disorder was being treated, would respond favorably to any natural or medicinal intervention that reduces the excitability of the neurological system. Although the use of brain-calming drugs in psychiatry is not new, what is new is the idea of focusing their use on correcting a specific physiological abnormality that is believed to underlie the symptoms. This technique, which could be called “Focused Neuroregulation,” would differ from standard pharmacotherapy in that if one anticonvulsant failed to alleviate or only partially alleviated symptoms, another anticonvulsant would be substituted or added rather than turning to an off-target class of drugs. This approach is clinically valid because each anticonvulsant is structurally different, and there are multiple mechanisms (and receptors) through which the excitability of the neurological system can be therapeutically regulated. Also, anticonvulsants, unlike other classes of psychotropic drugs, tend to bring the system back into balance; hence the term “mood stabilizers.” Yet another benefit of Focused Neuroregulation is that it could help prevent or slow the progression of the many chronic health conditions that have been linked to an inherent hyperexcitability of the neurological system. In recognition of these potential benefits, and in an effort to avoid the many problems that are associated with the symptom-based treatment of psychiatric and related functional symptoms, the aim of this article is to incentivize the study of a more targeted approach to the treatment of mental illness and the prevention of chronic disease.",

The diagnosis is established after other causes of anisocoria have been excluded. The purpose of this case report is to describe a case of benign episodic mydriasis of her right pupil in a 23-year-old female patient. The episodes lasted for 5-10 minutes and occurred spontaneously, without any concomitant symptoms or precipitating factors. The frequency of the episodes was variable, but she reported that it worsened in periods when she felt more mentally stressed or anxious. Contact with any kind of medications, homoeopathic drugs, industrial agents, or any other kind of chemical compounds was excluded, and the remaining neurological and systemic examination was unremarkable. Blood tests were taken and imaging was performed, which ruled out a structural lesion. A diagnosis of isolated benign episodic mydriasis was established. Unlike the typical presentation of the condition, the episodes did not occur in association with any form of migraine or headache. Given the benign nature of the condition, no treatment was instituted. After excluding potentially severe causes, and reassuring the patient, the frequency of the episodes decreased.",

      "title": "Trauma as a life event and its impact on suicidal behaviour",
      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

They became a focus of controversy regarding fragmentation of memory, identity and consciousness, especially regarding amnesia and memory retrieval of traumatic events. It became clear that trauma and dissociation are closely linked, both at the time of trauma and in its aftermath. The very discontinuity of experience brought about by trauma can be reflected in the discontinuity of memory and personal identity. As our understanding of other reactions to trauma led to the formulation of PTSD, recognition grew of a dissociative subtype in the DSM-5 that reflected suppression of trauma-related affect. Neurobiological research on dissociation has demonstrated characteristic activity in the region of the posterior cingulate cortex and a corresponding altered relationship with the prefrontal cortex. Dissociative disorders have been underdiagnosed and disrespected, but despite that they have not disappeared, and continue to be increasingly integrated into mainstream psychiatric and psychological thought.",

      "title": "Current Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment of Functional Neurological Disorders",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited. Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.",

They can emerge due to genetic factors or abnormalities in the brain or body acquired after birth, or because of faulty or incomplete physical experiences when learning more complex behavior. Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

Endocrine responses to stressful experience vary widely among individuals, and may account for some of the individual variability in vulnerability to development of psychosomatic symptoms under stress. Endocrine stress responsiveness probably has a large genetic component, but is also known to be modifiable by prolonged and/or profound stressful experience. Social and cognitive factors influence the pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and sex differences may also be significant. It may be possible to develop specific tests of endocrine responsiveness, perhaps incorporating psychological and pharmacological challenges, that may serve as markers of chronic stress experience or of vulnerability to psychosomatic disorders.",

Controversy surrounds the precise causation of the brain injury, the retinal and subdural haemorrhages, as well as the degree of force required and whether impact in addition to whiplash forces is needed.1 3 4 Although most discussion has concerned fatal injuries of this nature, not all are lethal, but they may be associated with subsequent neurological disability of varying severity.\n\nExpert medical evidence about inflicted injury must have scientific validity, but applying the evidence based criteria appropriate to clinical practice entails some difficulties.5 In clinical practice medical management of defined clinical problems can be compared and best practice distinguished by clinical outcomes.

      "title": "SPL12 HEAVY PHYSICAL WORK AND FATIGUE IN HEALTHCARE WORKERS",
      "abstract": "Abstract The fatigue that arises from work manifests itself as a feeling of constant fatigue or weakness. It can be physical, mental, or a combination of both. The occurrence of fatigue is influenced by physical, mental and sensory loads, night work, psychological and physical factors of the working environment, personality characteristics of the worker. In order to speak with certainty about the impact of work on humans, one must determine precisely in each particular case what type of work it is. In this sense, the difference is made whether it is static or dynamic work. If the factors such as physical and psychological load act longer than the worker can tolerate, there is a psychophysiological overstretchand a state between normal physiological and pathological with a tendency to pass into the pathological form, i.e. disease. Acute and chronic fatigue of health care workers is very common. Given that every healthcare professional during his working life meets with numerous hazards and dangers, it is very important that they are recognized in a certain way, evaluated / ranked in order to pay special attention to these hazards and dangers that represent a potential threat to the safety and health of health workers. In this context, a study of health workers currently employed in the Kotor Health Center, Emergency Medical Service and Kotor General Hospital was conducted with the aim of establishing the connection between acute and chronic fatigue among medical workers with sociodemographic work and life characteristics of respondents. As for the methods in the process of collecting data from the respondents, two questionnaires were used, which the respondents themselves completed the OFER15 questionnaire and the general questionnaire. Based on the analysis of the data, it can be concluded that recovery, acute and chronic fatigue are significantly higher among the hospital medical workers, which corresponds to the number of working hours that is higher compared to the other population that was examined.",

Pain, in its severer forms, as for example trigeminal neuralgia, migraine, or the various colics, is one of the heaviest crosses the human race has to bear. Usually pain is a danger signal or warning of some beginning disease process, trauma, or physiological upset. It also may be the hang-over effect of past disease processes. It can arise from purely psychic origin, which is perhaps the most difficult to alleviate. Transient painful processes usually are no problem, but persistent pain, whether mild or severe, over weeks, months, or years can produce serious and far-reaching sequelae, which affect the patients' work, play, and sleep, alter their personalities, and produce changes in every phase of their daily",

When any or all of these factors are disrupted by a progressive dementia it is unsurprising that sexual ‘problems’ are identified. Most sexual behaviour ‘problems’ relate to expressions of normal sexuality complicated by changes in relationships, care needs and cognitive function, and complex ethical and legal considerations emerge. Rarely, new and severe hypersexual or paraphilic behaviours arise de novo , usually due to damage to certain brain areas, and sometimes due to medication side-effects, psychiatric disorder or delirium. Evidence and approaches to assess and to manage sexual behaviour problems in dementia are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

Although this dichotomy between general medical and psychiatric pathology is somewhat dated according to the focus of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th Edition (DSM-5) Somatic Symptom Disorders, the psychogenic description of a medically unexplained symptom is still commonly used in the general medical vernacular. This case report involved a 74-year-old man who was presumed to have “psychogenic” nausea symptoms after a negative medical workup. New tremulous symptoms were presumed to be secondary to a benzodiazepine taper. However, the presence of additional focal neurological deficits prompted a computed tomography of the patient’s head, which revealed a subdural hematoma. Emergent neurosurgical evacuation and drainage relieved the patient’s symptoms and proved to be a life-saving measure. Subdural hematomas are most commonly the result of traumatic tearing of the cortical bridging veins that overlie this subdural space. Subsequent mass effect and ischemia from venous bleeding can cause multiple symptoms, including nausea. This case highlights the importance of ensuring a broad differential for medically unexplained symptoms and close monitoring of symptomatic changes.",

The majority of concussion symptoms will resolve within a month, but upward of a third of patients will have persistent, chronic symptoms. When these symptoms become chronic and persist beyond 1–3 months, this is termed post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Psychological changes associated with PCS may in part be due to a traumatic event and the injury itself and therefore post-traumatic stress reactions may contribute. In addition, alterations to daily life and alteration of lifestyle as a result of the injury can cause feelings of disconnection which in turn can feed anxiety and depression symptoms. A preinjury diagnosis or history of psychiatric or mood disorder, migraine, or family history of psychiatric illness is one the greatest risk factors for the development of PCS. It is recommended that evaluation of concussion and those with PCS take a multidisciplinary approach including evaluation by psychology, psychiatry, and/or neuropsychology. While most concussions do not require treatment, those with PCS will not likely see the resolution of their physical and psychological symptoms without intervention. Treatment is limited, but cognitive behavioral treatment has shown promise in the management of PCS symptoms. It is important to recognize the role psychology plays in the development and persistence of PCS and to recognize and seek collaborative care when treating these patients.",

      "title": "Euthymic suffering and wisdom psychology",
      "abstract": "In Fava and Guidi's paper1, euthymia is defined by \"lack of mood disturbances that can be subsumed under diagnostic rubrics\" , \"positive affects\" and \"psychological well-being\" . So, good mood is euthymic. But, what about bad mood and suffering which can also not be subsumed under diagnostic rubrics? Life is no rose garden. All human beings experience illness, failure, conflicts with others, problems with children or spouse, financial troubles, or legal disputes. It would be a mental disturbance to feel happy under these circumstances. Is euthymia limited to positive affects or happy hours, or should it include all forms of \"normal\" mood? That not all hardship and negative feelings automatically qualify as disorder is confirmed by the ICD-10, which provides separate codes (Z codes) for negative life situations such as loss of work, social exclusion, or burnout. If people feel unhappy when burdened by negative life events, this is no mental disorder, but \"healthy suffering\" . It is of great importance not to medicalize such everyday problems2. In clinical practice, there are many people who contact medical experts because of healthy suffering. They need a professional evaluation together with some advice. We need diagnostic criteria for healthy bad mood. Such criteria include situational adequacy of the type and intensity of the emotional reaction, self-appraisal, controllability, compliance with individual and social norms, lack of specific psychopathological signs and symptoms3. Healthy persons with normal bad mood display consistency in their behavior and values, show environmental mastery, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, flexibility, and resilience to go on with daily duties4. So, healthy suffering and bad mood should be included in the concept of euthymia. How can interventions deal with such a broadened concept of euthymia? There are basically four different approaches to foster euthymia. The first one is to get rid of bad mood by improving well-being through the increase of pleasant activities and experiences5. \"Regeneration therapy\"6 engages people in positive and self-care exercises, from board games to cultural and social activities, relaxation and make oneself up. Positive effects of these interventions were shown in regard to depressed mood or distress intolerance and the ability to work. The bottom line is that, if you are under stress, you should do something positive for yourself or coddle yourself. The second approach also aims to counteract bad mood, this time by teaching how to generate positive emotions directly. \"Euthymia therapy\"7 teaches the art of enjoyment and experiencing of pleasures. \"Well-being therapy\"1 teaches people to focus on constituents of positive mood by self-observation, change of dysfunctional cognitions, and promotion of activities. Studies on these interventions showed positive effects in depressed or psychosomatic patients transdiagnostically. The bottom line is to improve the capacity of the individual to generate positive emotions. A different type of approach is represented by \"mindfulness and acceptance\" based therapies8. Their primary goal is not to get rid of negative emotions and cognitions, but instead to change the individuals' relationship to their emotional state, their experiences, and the living context. This is done by encouraging awareness and acceptance of unpleasant feelings through mindfulness practice and cognitive defusion. Commitment and behavior change processes are based on contact with the present moment. Bad mood is accepted and may still be present after treatment. This approach implicitly has a broader concept of euthymia, including bad and positive mood alike. The bottom line is to accept and arrange oneself with something that cannot be changed. Another approach, which goes in the same direction, is \"wisdom therapy\"9. Life span psychology describes wisdom as a psychological capacity, given to all persons, which is essential in coping with severe, irreversible or unsolvable problems, but also in dealing with daily dilemmas, such as the decision whether to stay at home with a sick child or to go to work. Similar to other psychological capacities, there are about a dozen sub-dimensions, such as recognition of reality (factual and procedural knowledge, contextualism, relativization of problems and aspirations), mastery of emotions (perception and acceptance of emotions, serenity), acceptance of personal limitations (self-relativization, self-distance), clarification and self-assurance of goals and values (value relativism, forgiveness and acceptance of the past, uncertainty tolerance, long-term perspective), and interactional competencies (change of perspective, empathy). \"Wisdom therapy\" provides strategies to translate these sub-dimensions into treatment. There is evidence that it works in patients with severe adjustment disorders9. The goal of the intervention is to learn how to deal with bad and good times alike. Euthymia can be defined as a state of wisdom, in which persons feel at ease with themselves and the world, their past, the present and the future, in good and bad times, and do not lose heart and courage in the face of adversities and hardship. The concept of euthymia should reflect the daily existence of human beings. Happiness is limited to very few moments in life. Demands, hardship, burdens fill the rest of time. Back pain, heavy work or driving a car in combusted streets do not produce happiness. But there is nevertheless euthymia. The problem of mental illness is that people are overburdened and impaired by daily hassles, while healthy persons have resilience and can deal with bad times. We should not create the misunderstanding that happiness is the goal to be pursued by our interventions. This can lead to disappointment. Instead, mastery of exceptional and daily burdens and demands, and how nevertheless to \"feel OK\" (not happy but euthymic), should be the aim.",

There are three factors namely; mental breakdown, mental disturbances, and mental illness impair the mental health of employees. Stress is an unavoidable aspect of life. Workplace stress derives specifically from conditions in their workplace. This condition may either cause stress initially or aggravate the stress already present from other sources. Studies have pointed to the growth in non-standard work and other changing work patterns as contributing to a recent sharp increase in stress leads in the workplace. In organizations the ergonomic the concern is work stress, which in any action from an external source that affects the body. This creates a strain in the body resulting in some physiological response to the stress. Work stress due to unusual posture or improper postural adjustment to the work results in back pain, headaches, nervousness, aching muscles, excessive perspiration and depressions. The most serious result of work stress is serious traumatic injuries, accumulative injuries or death. Psychological factors that may cause stress are excessive heat, improper furniture (chairs, tables etc.), poor workplace, long work hours or any other type of situation in which individual performs his or her work in unusual situation or in a continuous manner. Ill health results in high rate of absenteeism and turnover, industrial discontent and indiscipline, poor performance and low productivity and more accidents. Besides, employee’s health also provides other benefits such as improved morale of employees, increased productivity of employees and also longer working period of an employee which, of course cannot be easily measured.",

      "title": "is Feigned Psychosis a Pathway to Schizophrenia?",
      "abstract": "Factitious disorders (FD) are characterized by intentional production of either physical, psychological or mixed symptoms that mimic various clinical syndromes, with no apparent advantage for the individual concerned other than allowing him to assume the sick role. Large body of work has been accumulated on FD, but the majority of published data deal with the physical variant of the disease, with comparable few reports on psychiatric FD. Although there are many different presentations for psychiatric FD, the factitious psychosis subset justifies particular attention. Factitious psychosis may be prodromic of a genuine chronic psychosis, usually in the context of a personality disorder. Published data shows Munchausen psychosis, a severe subset of FD psychosis, with a prevalence of 0.25% of all inpatient admissions and global FD psychosis attaining 4.1% of all diagnosed psychoses, generally with a poor prognosis. The scantiness of studies on the subject of psychiatric FD and factitious psychosis in particular, despite its significant prevalence, coupled with the fact that its recognition embarks on a radically different approach compared with the physical variant, stresses the need for case reporting. We present four clinical cases with discussion of the underlying pathology and outcome, and a systematic review of the literature of FD psychosis case reports. This is followed by further discussion addressing the recognition of factitious psychosis, its etiological contributing factors, management, effects on staff and diagnostic criteria.",

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

The mental anguish occasioned by the situation is so great that subconsciously the patient prefers the distraction of simulated physical suffering. The concern over the illness relegates the real issue to the background. Sympathy and attention that are not received when the patient is healthy and escape from unpleasant duties are factors which make this type of illness attractive and preferable. Too often the psychoneurosis is further fixed by a physician's diagnosis of organic disease and the scientific justification of the illness which such an opinion entails. Unfortunately, the patient is not aware of the connection between his symptoms and their causes. After the physician has gained the complete confidence of the patient, direct, tactful questioning often suffices to bring to light the underlying psychically traumatic situation.

Este ensayo reflexivo, se ha propuesto analizar el fenómeno y abordarlo desde diversas perspectivas psicológicas que nos brinden una posible explicación lógica y coherente del suceso con el fin de esclarecerlo frente a las supersticiones de la cultura a través del método hermenéutico. Los signos de los posesos pueden deberse a otros factores, tanto neurobiológicos como psicológicos, como, por ejemplo, la aversión a los objetos religiosos y el surgimiento de una segunda personalidad, puede deberse a un cuadro de trastorno conversivo (neurosis) o presentarse en la esquizofrenia (psicosis), y la amnesia después del episodio puede deberse a la sobrecarga funcional del cerebro. Existen otros signos más complejos de explicar, como lo son el hablar en lenguas diferentes o la levitación; el primero lo trataremos descriptivamente desde el síndrome del idioma extranjero, que puede presentarse producto de factores neurológicos o en la misma psicosis, y la levitación podemos verla desde la física, con la llamada levitación magnética, a través de una hipótesis en la cual esta condición podría cumplirse en los seres humanos debido a la sobreexcitación cerebral que generaría cierto campo magnético. Finalmente, dentro de los aportes del psicoanálisis encontramos la neurosis como forma en que se manifiesta este fenómeno y damos por concluido que la posesión demoníaca se debe a dos sucesos: neurosis o psicosis, recalcando la importancia del análisis del contexto para realizar criterios diferenciadores en nuestro diagnóstico psicológico.",

Concussion—sometimes called mild traumatic brain injury—is different from other forms of head injury. Concussions usually involve some temporary disruption of thinking skills or brief alteration of awareness, among other symptoms. Concussion has many different acute symptoms, and these same symptoms occur in a variety of health conditions and situations, which can sometimes make concussions difficult to detect. Symptoms may affect physical, cognitive, or emotional functioning as well as sleep.",

      "title": "Measurement in psychiatry",
      "abstract": "The science of the measurement of mental phenomena (psychometrics) is central to quantitative research in psychiatry. Without appropriate, accurate, stable, and unbiased measures, our research is doomed from the outset. Much effort has been expended over the last 40 years in the development of a bewildering array of assessments. Most of our measurement strategies are based on eliciting symptoms, either by asking the participant to complete a self-report questionnaire, or by using an interviewer to question the participant. Some are long, detailed, and comprehensive clinical diagnostic assessments. Others are much briefer, designed either to screen for probable cases, or as scalable measures in their own right, of a trait or dimension such as depression, neuroticism or cognitive function or as measures of an exposure to a possible risk factor for a disease. Researchers in other medical disciplines sometimes criticise psychiatric measures for being vague or woolly, because they are not based on biological markers of pathology. For this very reason, psychiatry was among the first medical disciplines to develop internationally recognized operationalized diagnostic criteria. At the same time the research interview has become progressively refined, such that the processes of eliciting, recording, and distilling symptoms into diagnoses or scalable traits are now also highly standardized. These criticisms are therefore largely misplaced. Thanks to the careful construction and extensive validation of the better established measures in psychiatric research we can now afford to be slightly more confident of their appropriateness, accuracy, and stability than would be the case even for some biological measurements. This confidence is based on our understanding of the <italic>validity</italic> and <italic>reliability</italic> of our measures.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population.

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) delirium is a common complication after major surgery and related among other potential medical precipitants to either pre-existing cognitive impairment or the intensity and length of anesthesiology or the type of surgery. Nevertheless, in some rare situations, an organic etiology is not always found, which can be frustrating for the medical team. Some clinicians working in an intensive care unit have a reluctance to seek another hypothesis in the psychological field. Method: To illustrate this, we report the case of a 59-year-old woman who developed a massive delirium during her intensive care unit stay after being operated on for a left retroperitoneal sarcoma. Interestingly, she had had no previous cognitive disorders and a somatic explanation for her psychiatric disorder could not been found. Just before the surgery, she was grieving the recent loss of a colleague of the same age, and also a close friend, and therefore had a death anxiety. Results: With this case report, we would like to point out the importance of psychological factors that might precipitate delirium in a predominately somatic environment such as an intensive care unit. Significance of results: ICU delirium can sometimes be considered as a “psychosomatic” problem with either a stress response syndrome after surgery or a defense mechanism against death anxiety. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of such psychological factors even if they always must first rule out potential somatic causes for delirium and encourage thorough investigation and treatment of these medical causes. A collaboration with the psycho-oncologist is recommended to better manage this “psychosomatic” problem.",

On the other hand, depression can also be described as a quantifiable diseased state of the brain that may be cured using a biological therapy or pharmaceutical. Neither one of these definitions is incorrect; rather, they each describe different aspects of this form of mental illness. This duality inherent to understanding depression makes light of the sparse assemblage of literature that exists concerning such a socially, psychologically, and biologically complex phenomenon. Research has shown that the therapeutic benefits of exercise offer treatment for both the psychosocial and biological effects of depression. A more unified research perspective that looks for a coincidence of the social with the biological may allow for steps forward in understanding mental illness and disease.",

      "title": "Syncope And Related Paroxysmal Spells",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal spells are non-epileptic, paroxysmal events that may mimic epileptic seizures but are not associated with rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons typical of seizures. They clinically manifest as a transient loss of consciousness, often occurring suddenly, with or without a prodrome. Paroxysmal spells can be caused by psychological disorders such as substance abuse and psychiatric disease or physiological events such as hypoglycemia, traumatic brain injury, and syncope. Psychological Conditions Data suggest that men with psychiatric disease have an increased incidence of syncope or paroxysmal events of unknown etiology. This data should lead clinicians to consider screening for psychiatric disorders in patients with transient loss of consciousness they cannot identify with a clear etiology.Among patients with a history of substance use disorder, 45% have been found to have unexplained syncope. This suggests that prior and current substance use is also associated with increased incidence of transient loss of consciousness of unknown etiology. Patients evaluated in the emergency department or even hospitalized with syncope of unknown etiology may benefit from toxicology screening and possible detoxification referral. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is defined as low blood sugar with associated symptoms. In patients without diabetes mellitus, this is usually manifested at glucose levels below 50 mg/dl. To diagnose hypoglycemia, symptoms and blood sugar must improve with exogenous glucose. Hypoglycemia can affect the central nervous system, leading to lightheadedness, nausea, flashes of light, focal neurological deficits, transient loss of consciousness, and seizure. It is, therefore, paramount that patients with any paroxysmal spell or syncope receive a fingerstick glucose. Traumatic Brain Injury Traumatic brain injury is an intracranial impairment, often due to external forces. These forces may include blunt or penetrating trauma to the head, causing acceleration/deceleration injury to the cerebral cortex. Intracerebral bleeding, lacerations, and diffuse axonal injuries may result. Injuries, such as an epidural hematoma, may cause a brief state of loss of consciousness, with rapid return of, usually, altered consciousness. Other injuries, such as large subdural hematoma or diffuse axonal injury may cause worsening mentation and coma over hours to days. This is a result of increased intracranial pressure, leading to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, and finally, neuronal ischemia. Diagnosis is by clinical history and CT imaging, although MRI may be more specific for secondary trauma. Management is to reduce intracranial pressure and edema. Syncope As most paroxysmal events are syncopal, the remainder of this discussion will focus primarily on syncope. Physiologically, syncope is a transient loss of consciousness as a result of cerebral hypoperfusion. As such, syncope varies from other etiologies of loss of consciousness in that it does not include head trauma or a post-ictal state. Syncope instead results in complete and rapid resolution of mental status. It may have myoclonic jerking, but no generalized tonic-clonic movement. Rather than a disease, syncope is a symptom of an underlying pathology ranging from benign to life-threatening. Patients are often divided into low-risk and high-risk groups. The etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, treatment, and management of these patients vary greatly. In the United States, hospitalization costs for syncope are estimated to be $5300 per admission and more than $2 billion annually. These costs are higher than those of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma combined. As extensive workups can be costly, time-consuming, and often unnecessary, a growing cadre of management tools has been devised to evaluate patients with syncope. These tools are tailored to determining the etiology of the syncopal event and treating dangerous, high-risk, syncope patients.",

      "title": "Post‐traumatic stress disorder as moderator of other mental health conditions",
      "abstract": "The comorbidity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a range of other mental disorders is common. This comorbidity is often attributed to either overlapping symptoms between PTSD and other disorders or to the variety of psychiatric conditions that can arise in the wake of exposure to a traumatic experience. However, this comorbidity may also be due to the fact that PTSD can moderate the onset or severity of other psychiatric symptoms or disorders. This is an important issue, because it has implications for how patients affected by the array of symptoms that can emerge after trauma may be most efficiently managed. Our knowledge of how PTSD can impact other disorders rests on longitudinal studies that have assessed PTSD and other conditions, and have typically conducted cross-lagged or time-series analyses. This approach allows us to determine the extent to which each condition impacts other disorders at later assessments. Convergent evidence indicates that PTSD can precede or exacerbate depression, anxiety disorders, suicidality, substance abuse, eating disorders, and psychosis1. Furthermore, PTSD can precede a range of physical and behavioral indicators, including chronic pain and tobacco use. There is also evidence from network analysis indicating how symptoms of PTSD may impact other psychiatric symptoms. Network analysis conceptualizes psychopathological states as resulting from causal paths between different symptoms – rather than emerging from an underlying disease state2, 3. For example, the PTSD symptom of nightmares may play a causal role in contributing to sleep disturbance, which in turn leads to concentration deficits and irritability. Numerous studies using network analysis have shown that specific PTSD symptoms can influence problems across other conditions, including depression and anx­iety disorders4. In explaining the role of PTSD as a mediator of the relationship between trauma exposure and onset of other psychiatric disorders, there are several mechanisms that can be considered, and these arguably function in an interactive manner. One key potential mechanism is the impact of PTSD on the capacity to down-regulate emotional distress. It is well documented that PTSD involves impaired emotion regulation, and it is possible that this impairment predisposes people to develop new psychiatric disorders or worsens others5. The capacity to regulate emotions in PTSD can be related to the well-documented deficits in executive functioning6. Deficient working memory and attentional capacity can limit the extent to which one can regulate emotions, which can result in greater risk for mental health problems. Moreover, avoidance is a key symptom of PTSD, and this can trigger a cascade of strategies that can be maladaptive. Avoidance can involve situations or thoughts and memories related to the traumatic experience. This tendency can generalize to more pervasive avoidance of social networks, emotional states, and activities that promote good mental health. This can lead to a worsening of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric conditions. Another common form of avoidance for people with PTSD is self-medicating with prescription or non-prescription substances to numb the distress that is experienced along with traumatic memories. This behaviour can not only lead to substance abuse, which has been documented in longitudinal studies of PTSD, but also facilitate other psychiatric problems, because issues may not be addressed in a constructive manner. Avoidance tendencies can also result in not seeking help from mental health services, which can impede early intervention or adequate treatment for other psychiatric disorders. The DSM-5 explicitly recognizes the presence of harmful behaviors in PTSD, including such risk-taking behaviors as dangerous driving, severe alcohol use, and self-harm. These reactions are conceptualized as a result of the extreme arousal and the difficulties in impulse control that can be experienced by people with PTSD7. These behaviors can lead to a range of events and habits triggering repetitive cycles of exposure to trauma. This can compound the sensitization that has been reported in PTSD, in which the condition results in neural sensitivity to threats and stressors in one's environment, such that the person is more reactive to these events. One of the strongest transdiagnostic predictors of risk for mental health problems is represented by maladaptive or catastrophic appraisals about oneself or the environment8. A key feature of PTSD is the tendency to engage in catastrophic appraisals after the traumatic experience, and these appraisals can generalize to many aspects of a person's life, such as one's self-esteem, trust in others, fears of negative evaluations, germs, or self-blame. These cognitive tendencies are major risk factors for an array of psychiatric conditions, including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Relatedly, the tendency to ruminate is well documented after trauma, and this habit of repeatedly thinking about negative events is a major risk factor for many psychiatric conditions. In considering these various mechanisms for how PTSD can moderate other psychiatric problems, it is worth noting that many of the risk factors reviewed here may be present prior to trauma exposure, and in fact predispose the person to developing PTSD. These elements can be intensified as PTSD develops, and then contribute to other psychiatric conditions which have a shared vulnerability. In this context, it is especially worth recognizing the emerging evidence on shared genetic vulnerabilities to a range of psychiatric disorders9. In the wake of trauma exposure and PTSD development, gene expression can predispose an individual to develop other psychiatric disorders by means of the shared genetic vulnerability. Overall, this evidence reflects the interactive multifactorial nature of the processes explaining how PTSD can lead to the onset or worsening of other psychiatric conditions. Understanding how PTSD can impact on other psychological problems is an important area of future research, because it has important treatment implications. Targeting PTSD may have downstream benefits for many problems beyond the specific domain of that disorder.",

Inclusion within this second group, however, could occur for a number of different reasons-none of which is mutually exclusive. It may be that an underlying pathological agent does in fact exist but has yet to be identified. In this case, it may just be a matter of time, test sensitivity and technical breakthrough before a proven physiological abnormality and a relevant causal link will be established.

Pourtant, l’anxiete comme la depression peuvent donner lieu a des troubles psychiatriques majeurs, associes a d’importantes perturbations cognitives. Ces perturbations ont ete mises en evidence voici deja de nombreuses annees. La depression, en particulier, entraine chez le patient de reelles difficultes psycho-motrices, se manifestant notamment par un ralentissement general ainsi que des troubles mnesiques, attentionnels, et executifs. Ces alterations ont pu etre associees a differentes modifications du cerveau meme, attestant de bouleversements profonds de la structure cerebrale et des connexions neuronales, a la source ou consecutives a l’etat depressif. Outre ces perturbations que nous qualifierons de cognitives, des difficultes du traitement emotionnel ont egalement ete demontrees. Plus specifiquement, les patients depressifs semblent manifester un biais lorsqu’ils doivent analyser du materiel emotionnel. Ce biais est decrit comme un traitement affecte (dans le sens d’une facilitation ou au contraire d’un ralentissement) de tout contenu a valence emotionnel, comprenant par exemple des mots a valence emotionnelle (designant des emotions, des sentiments), des textes ou scenario, des scenes visuelles ou des visages. Dans ce chapitre, nous tenterons de synthetiser les principaux apports de la psychopathologie cognitive a l’etude de ces deux grands syndromes que sont la depression et les troubles anxieux.

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder In Children",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that may develop in some children and adolescents after exposure to a traumatic event. Traumatic events may include incidents that involve serious harm to self or others and include accidents, natural disasters, sexual or physical trauma, natural disasters, and violence.Since time immemorial, scientists have pursued the ever-elusive causal origins of disease processes. To the detriment of humanity, these endeavors frequently resulted in fruitless pursuits, as we still can only postulate the etiologies of many illnesses. Thus, the causal nature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) places it in the company of a scant few psychiatric diagnoses where etiology is known. The temporal association between the event exposure and the subsequent symptom manifestation is not simply a post hoc fallacy. Not to be misled by the putative simplistic nature of the etiology, the consequent psychiatric sequelae can, in turn, be debilitating. Moreover, recent studies have unmasked unsettling discoveries regarding pediatric considerations in the setting of PTSD. It has been suggested that a substantial number of children have gone inappropriately undiagnosed because of the insufficient sensitivities of previous guidelines. Children often react differently to stressful events, and because of this, the pediatric phenomenology of PTSD differs from that of the adults. The transition from DSM IV to DSM-V acknowledges this inconsistency, made evident by the additional criteria specific to PTSD for children six years or younger. PTSD is defined by four symptom clusters, including avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, intrusion, and hyperarousal per DSM-5. The consequences of PTSD are often deleterious with adverse outcomes in physical and mental health besides impaired social and occupational functioning.",

They can be classified in some ways, of which we highlight those in terms of its localization or etiology. Psychogenic dystonia is an exclusion diagnosis, which is infradiagnosed due to the difficulty to specify the disorder. We proposed a review over its use in usual clinical practice, in relation to the symptoms, difficulties of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Development: The inconsistency of symptoms and incongruity with the classical symptomatology, and so the poor therapeutic answer to usual treatments set out to the diagnosis. Its psychiatric comorbility with anxiety, depression, somatizations, conversion symptomatology or personality traits would support the diagnosis; but its presence is not strictly necessary. Psychiatric characteristics are sometimes seen trough the basis of movement disorder of neurological origin. Symptoms of depression or anxiety are related with a better prognosis, while cronification, insidious onset, the diagnosis of hypocondria, the factitious disorder or the simulation are related with poor prognosis. It's recommended a combined pharmacologic-psycotherapic treatment. Recent studies with antidepressants have shown encouraging results.

      "title": "The complex conundrum of geriatric depression and dementias",
      "abstract": "Late-life depression (LLD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia are clinically distinct yet interrelated disease constructs, wherein LLD can be a prodrome, risk factor, comorbidity, or consequence of MCI and dementia. There is considerable prevalence of depression in those with MCI or dementia, and vice versa, with maximum evidence in Alzheimer's disease. These intersections often form one of the most confusing aspects of psychogeriatric practice, leading to under-detection and mismanagement of depression, thus leading to incomplete recovery in most cases. This article focuses on this clinical ambiguity in daily practice, reviews the clinico-investigative pointers for the LLD–dementia intersection, and puts forward clinical and research recommendations in view of the available evidence. Although there is conflicting evidence regarding the cause–effect relationship between LLD, MCI, and dementia, it is likely that these constructs share some common pathological processes and are often associated with each other within a longitudinal clinical continuum. This is a linear yet complex bidirectional association: either the comorbid depression exaggerates preexisting cognitive deficits or chronic persistent depression eventually leads to major neurocognitive disorders, not to mention depression as a part of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, which often impairs quality of life and psychosocial morbidity. Thus, a comprehensive approach, including tailored history, neuropsychiatric examination, and relevant investigations, is necessary for assessing the differentials, with a sound clinical understanding being vital to the process. Depression, if suspected, must be treated adequately with longitudinal neuropsychological reviews. Future research warrants elucidating precision biomarkers unique to these clinicopathological entities.",

Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Article Abstract A diagnosis of bipolar disorder is difficult to make when a depressed patient can provide no evidence of having experienced mania or hypomania, either because the elevated mood states are not recognized as periods of illness or because depression is the initial episode and the patient has yet to experience the other polarity of the disorder. In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

      "abstract": "The term psychogenic or reactive psychosis is used to describe a psychotic state which is experience-related and triggered by a precipitating event. Experimental studies have confirmed that under total sensory deprivation man responds by exhibiting psychotic reactions within a short time. Emotion psychoses, brief reactive psychoses are psychotic reactions due to an emotional shock. They usually go beyond the usual pathological psychoreactions in terms of quality, intensity and duration. Emotion psychoses show schizophrenia-like symptoms; the duration of illness varies from a few hours to several weeks. Emotion psychoses are observed in other cultural groups, too. Two case reports are mentioned. The differential diagnosis of emotion psychoses, of psychotic reactions induced by extreme situations, and the question whether chronic psychoses may have psychogenic causes, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs) are reported to be among the most prevalent and unfavourable mental disorders in the individuals who have gone through life-threatening situations. For the late decades, they have been standing out against the background of marginal mental disorders. PTSDs are caused by an individual’s direct involvement in the stress event, fraught with grave consequences and accompanied by mortal fear, horror and sensation of powerlessness. The problem is pressing for the today’sUkrainein view of theDonbaswarfare, mass resettlement, changes of job and forms of activity. The disease may be diagnosed as PTSD in the case the groups of symptoms persist more than a month since a traumatic event has occurred. For a long time, a good many of soldiers have been reported to reveal anxiety-phobic and behavioural disorders, as well as the signs of organic cerebral lesion. Some of them occur during combat operations, whereas the most of symptoms develop and aggravate 1-2 years after coming home. The PTSD patients mostly develop insomnia, anxiety, depression, and increased aggressiveness, which cause conflicts. An individual may become wicked, aggressive, discontented and cynical on a social basis. Depressive symptoms are hypothesized to mediate the relationship between PTSD and aggression. The ATO men with PTSD, who do not take alcohol, develop depression 1-1.5 year after coming back and, with alcohol added, the problem of aggression arises. Based on this, we suggest that a staff of personnel, trained in psychological aid to the combatants with PTSD, should be formed. Besides, our cases prove that, with friendly support and compassion as well as active stand in life and adequate social work, aggression and proneness to conflict are unlikely to develop. On the contrary, lack of support results in excessive alcohol consumption and, thereof, increased proneness to conflict. The system of treatment and rehabilitation measures for survives should involve combination of psychotherapy, psychological correction, and medicines.",

      "title": "Neurobiology of Behavior: Anatomic and Physiological Implications Related to Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Summary: Controversy exists concerning whether epileptic seizures can produce enduring alterations in neuronal function that cause interictal behavioral disturbances. Although arguments favoring the occurrence of epilepsy‐induced disorders of behavior must not be presented in a way that adds to the stigmata associated with epilepsy, it is not in the best interest of epileptic patients to deny this possible relationship and overlook an opportunity to prevent or treat a major cause of disability. There is evidence to suggest that psychosocial factors cannot account for all the behavioral problems suffered by patients with epilepsy. Behavioral disturbances ascribed to antiepileptic drugs and specific structural lesions may also be due, in part, to epileptogenic mechanisms. Some interictal behavioral disturbances may actually reflect unrecognized ictal events. Most importantly, data obtained from clinical research and animal investigations suggest testable hypotheses of how recurrent epileptic seizures can alter neuronal function in ways that would predispose to specific disruptive interictal behaviors, such as aggression, depression and schizophrenia.",

Dieser Nachweis kann nur in Einzelfällen erfolgen. Größere systematische Untersuchungen fehlen. Die International Classification of Headache Disorders der International Headache Society erkennt auch in ihrer dritten Auflage (Beta-Version) nur die Somatisierungsstörung und die psychotische Störung als mögliche psychische Erkrankungen für die Auslösung sekundärer Kopfschmerzen an. Im Anhang der Klassifikation finden sich weitere psychische Erkrankungen, die möglicherweise sekundäre Kopfschmerzen auslösen können.

      "title": "A Case Report of Schizoaffective Disorder with Pseudoseizures in a 42-year-old Male",
      "abstract": "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), historically referred to as pseudoseizures or hysterical seizures, are sudden disturbances of motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, or emotional functions that can mimic epileptic seizures. PNES have a psychologic etiology related to dissociative disorders or conversion disorders, as opposed to the abnormally excessive neuronal activity found in epileptic seizures. Psychosocial conflicts are essentially converted into physical symptoms, resulting in seizure-like symptoms. This case report presents a 42-year-old male with a past history of child abuse, drug abuse, schizoaffective disorder, prior psychiatric hospitalizations, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was admitted to the behavioral health unit with recurrent seizure-like episodes. These episodes were witnessed in the ED, however, appropriate workup failed to confirm abnormal neural activity or evidence of any brain injury. The patient was admitted to the psychiatric service where he was monitored for additional epileptic activity using long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring (LT-VEEG). While subsequent clinical events that resembled epileptic seizures were observed, the LT-VEEG failed to identify any epileptic activity. A diagnosis of PNES was established and a decision was made for the patient to remain on his current antiepileptic, psychiatric, and diabetes medications during his hospitalization. He showed gradual improvement during his stay and confirmed an understanding of his diagnosis. He was released three days later with instructions for follow-up and continued treatment with his outpatient psychiatrist. Early therapeutic counseling in patients who have a differential diagnosis of PNES should be considered to help identify and address the underlying causes of the seizure activity in an effort to curtail these seizure-like events.",

They are less commonly diagnosed than migraine, their pathophysiology is poorly understood, and evidence for their treatment is mostly anecdotal. Importantly, however, although considered primary headaches after a period of observation, many can present, at least initially, as manifestations of other conditions. Whereas headaches such as primary stabbing headache and hypnic headache are primary in most instances, others, such as those attributed to exercise or sexual activity or thunderclap headache, may present acutely in an emergency department setting, in which imaging and other testing may be appropriate to rule out secondary causes.",

      "title": "Psychodiagnostics as a mandatory element of patient protocols in dentistry",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The psycho-emotional status of patients requiring dental treatment is severely affected by constant stress.[1] Stress is associated with visible or perceived defects that disrupt the patient's image: difficulties in articulating words during chewing or communicating with other people. The severity of such a stressful condition depends on several factors. Among these are the type of nervous activity, characteristics of the patient's perception of their image, social environment and social reaction to the patient's appearance, patient's assessment of their own condition, and the dentist's attitude toward the patient's psycho-emotional state.[2] Many unsuccessful dental interventions occur primarily due to the negative emotional mood of patients; however, they also deal with the discomfort that they experience both during and after the dental procedure. That is exacerbated by increasing stress, anxiety, and psycho-emotional tension or exhaustion, diminishing the positive effect of dental treatment.[3] Further, numerous research works observed possible changes in the normal functioning of the patient's body, namely, in pulse, blood pressure, and heart rate values.[456] These are visible in the results of studies when the ECG was performed during dental surgery.[7] Such deviations might also have the opposite effect. Thus, psycho-emotional stress leads to a delay in the grafting process. Changes in the nervous and endocrine systems can cause certain disturbances in the hemostatic system.[8] High emotional tension is also known to cause a specific contraction of the skeletal musculature of the face, which results in a manifestation of a local vascular response.[9] Another psycho-emotional trait that characterizes patients with dental problems is the anticipation of pain far before the start of the surgery. Some particularly sensitive patients can experience serious emotional trauma, even during simple dental procedures such as dental extraction. Fear can occur at the anesthesia stage, and the patient's body is then characterized by an increase in energy expenditure, which exceeds energy production. Psycho-emotional stress results in a 17% increase in oxygen consumption on average, triggering anaerobic glycolysis. This process, in turn, is a precursor to acidosis, leading to tissue hypoxia and a delayed reparation process. Increased anxiety is the cause of maladaptation and the appearance of neuropsychic disorders, as well as a slower recovery rate after surgery.[10] Psychodiagnosis is, thus, a necessary element of dental treatment. The use of dental questionnaires contributes to the selection of appropriate tactics for interaction between the physician and the patient. In this case, the questionnaires both before and after patients' dental treatment appear necessary. Comparing the results of the pretreatment and posttreatment questionnaire provides good insights into the effectiveness of dental treatment. As there are relatively few studies of this type to date, it appears necessary and relevant to conduct them. In order to adequately assess patient satisfaction with the quality of dental care provided, specialized questionnaires may be helpful, in addition to traditional methods of psycho-emotional analysis.[11] They contain dental questions that are relevant to both the dentist and the patient.[12] Once these questionnaires have been analyzed, the right tactics for patient rehabilitation can be selected.[13] A logical construction of such an analysis is the study of changes in the values of indicators of the patient's psychological state both before and after dental intervention.[14] Such an analysis is a reliable measure of the effectiveness and quality of dental care provided.[1516] Further, these studies appear necessary as they may contribute to the improvement of dental service quality. This study aims at performing a comparative analysis of the psycho-emotional condition of patients both before and after dental surgery. The objectives of the study were: (a) to examine the psycho-emotional state of patients with removable constructions; (b) similarly, to examine the state of patients with fixed constructions. MATERIALS AND METHODS MATERIALS The study was conducted in the Russian Federation in 2019–2020; it addressed data on patients from three dental clinics (two clinics from the Moscow city [Dental Clinic No. 62 of the Moscow City Health Department and Dental Clinic No. 12 of the Moscow City Health Department] and one clinic from the Perm city [City Dental Clinic No. 1]). The study involved a total of 600 patients divided into three groups. The patients' age ranged from 22 to 63 years, with a mean age of 42.0 ± 5.5 years. The average age and the number of men and women in each group are shown in Table 1.Table 1: Gender composition and average age of patients in the three groupsThe number of men and women in each group was similar (P ≥ 0.05; Table 1). The age of patients within each group and between groups also had no significant differences. The first group consisted of 200 patients with fixed dentures (metal-ceramic, used up to 3 years); the second group included patients with removable devices (200 patients); and the control group comprised 200 patients with healthy teeth. The dental procedures were provided under local anesthesia. STUDY DESIGN The Fere method was applied to estimate the predominant activity of the hemispheres. A scheme included three components: a current source and its amplifier (15 mAm) + silver electrodes (S = 2 cm2) + ohmmeter. Parameters of this skin-galvanic reaction were taken from two fingers of the right and left hands. Parameters on different hands were measured separately, first on the left hand and then on the right hand. Low resistance values at the moment of data acquisition allowed concluding the right hemisphere dominance in the patient's mental and emotional spheres and the corresponding emotional manifestations, namely, aggression, negative emotions, and increased anxiety. On the left side, the same data indicated the dominance of the left hemisphere with the corresponding emotions—satisfaction and positive emotions. Afterward, a bilateral asymmetry of hemispheric activity was calculated, when the left-hand indicators were divided by the right-hand indicators. The index value equaling to one was considered to be a physiological norm. Thus, the activity of the hemispheres was balanced. This study was conducted following international ethical and moral standards (the Helsinki Declaration of 1975). When working with patients, their written consent to data processing was obtained. Anonymity and confidentiality of information were preserved. RESEARCH METHODS Levels of anxiety and pain were determined by using a questionnaire. For this purpose, a generally accepted scale of patients' self-assessment of anxiety by Spielberger and Hanin and a Universal Pain Assessment Tool were applied. This test adequately reflects personal and reactive anxiety, estimating it as a constant characteristic of a personality. The advantage of the test is its validity and informativeness in the self-assessment of anxiety levels. The test includes two blocks corresponding to the level of reactive (questions 1 to 20) and personal (questions 21 to 40) anxiety. Reactive anxiety was calculated following the formula P = (A1 − A2) + 50, where A1 is the sum of 3–4, 6–7, 9, 12–14, and 18 items of the anxiety level scale, and A2 is the sum of items 1–2, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 19–20. Similarly, the level of personal anxiety was calculated using the formula L = (A1 − A2) + 35, in which A1 corresponds to the sum of items from questions 22 to 25 inclusive, questions 28 and 29, 31 and 32, also questions 34 and 35, questions 37 to 39 inclusive, and A2 is the sum of items from the remaining questions. Pain level was interpreted on a scale from 0 to 10 or by monitoring the patient's behavior. Each patient also filled out a questionnaire designed to express their opinion about the quality of dental treatment received. The questionnaire included questions on the patient's assessment of their teeth condition and their opinion on how the treatment affected their health and various aspects of life. The list of questions also included social aspects of the patient's life and, from the patient's point of view, the necessity and obligation of visiting the dentist. RESEARCH ALGORITHM The study was performed in the following way. First, a testing of Fere's skin-galvanic reaction was performed. Then, each of the patients filled out a quality-of-life questionnaire developed by the authors. Pain assessment was performed during the dental procedure under local anesthesia. Afterward, the skin-galvanic reaction readings were taken again, and the Spielberger-Hanin Scale questionnaire was administered. The Anxiety Scale questionnaire was offered once since in case of repeated completion, the patient may deliberately change the answers following his/her momentum opinion that the wrong answer was chosen at the beginning. The aim was to capture the possible relationship between questions about dental health and changes in anxiety levels. The algorithm allows establishing a clear psychodiagnostic of the patient's psychic state after the dental procedure, in particular, to reveal any changes in anxiety scores after the received therapy. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The data were processed using Statistica v. 6.0. A two-sample t-test for independent samples was used to detect the significance of differences. Differences were considered significant at P ≤ 0.05. The distribution of features corresponded to normal, allowing for the establishment of Pearson's correlations. Tables 1–3 show arithmetic mean values for each parameter and the error of the mean.Table 2: Psychodiagnostics results of patients with healthy teeth (control group) before and after the survey about the condition of teethTable 3: Characteristics of psycho-emotional condition in patients from Group 1 (fixed metal-ceramic dentures) before and after evaluation of dental statusRESULTS For the control group, the asymmetry hemispheric activity index in 81 patients was within unity, which corresponded to a state of equilibrium. For another 69 patients, this index was less than unity, which corresponded to positive mood and the dominance of the left hemisphere. Finally, in 60 patients, the coefficient exceeded unity, which corresponded to dominance of the right hemisphere and negative emotional mood [Table 2]. In the control group, significant differences were established only for female patients. In both groups, with equilibrium and negative hemispheric activity index, the differences between the values before and after treatment were significant toward a 1.1-fold increase [Table 2]. The other indicators, particularly in the male group, did not differ from those in the control one. A direct correlation was established between the score in the dental status questionnaire and the emotions with which the patient filled out the questionnaire. This correlation was more pronounced in women (0.72; P ≤ 0.05) compared with men, namely, 0.72 vs. 0.57 at P ≤ 0.05, respectively. Consequently, the emotional state of the patients can influence the answers in the dental status questionnaire. There was also a direct correlation between the score growth in the questionnaire and the values of the hemispheric activity index after the survey, namely, 0.75 (P ≤ 0.05) for women and 0.64 (P ≤ 0.05) for men. Thus, the questions of the survey itself can have a significant influence on the patients' emotional state. At the same time, no statistically significant correlation between anxiety scores and the results of the dental status questionnaire were recorded for the control group. For patients from the second group with removable dentures, the hemispheric activity index corresponded to unity in 83 patients, that is, was equilibrium; in 48 patients, it was less than unity, that is, the left hemisphere and positive emotions dominated; and in the remaining 69 patients, the index exceeded unity, that is, the right hemisphere and negative emotions dominated. However, after a survey about dental health, the following changes were observed: 55 patients reported a state of equilibrium, 37 patients had positive emotional disposition, and the remaining 108 had a negative empathy. Significant changes were also obtained for the hemispheric activity index after the dental status survey, namely a 1.3-fold in men with the positive emotional disposition (P ≤ 0.01), a 2.2-fold in women with the negative emotional disposition (P ≤ 0.01), and a 2.1-fold in men from the same group (P ≤ 0.01). Also, a direct correlation between the increase of patients' questionnaire scores and their emotional state was recorded: 0.70 for women (P ≤ 0.05) and 0.79 for men (P ≤ 0.05). These results indicate the influence of the patient's emotional state on the questionnaire results. After the survey, however, this relationship intensified in Group 2, and the correlation between the scores and hemispheric activity factor was 0.88 for women (P ≤ 0.05) and 0.91 for men (P ≤ 0.05). In contrast to the control group, there was also a correlation between the anxiety level and score growth rates. Thus, for personal anxiety in men, the Pearson's correlation was 0.84 for both genders (P ≤ 0.05), whereas the reactive anxiety index amounted to 0.78 for women and 0.81 for men (P ≤ 0.05). The increasing level of anxiety indicates a negative influence of responses about dental treatment, which is also illustrated by the increasing number of patients with a negative emotional empathy in Group 2. Patients in Group 1 had a similar emotional state distribution compared with Group 2 before completing the dental status questionnaire. Thus, 87 had an equilibrium status with index values around unity, 68 were positive, and 43 were negative [Table 3]. After the patients answered the questions about dental health, the ratio of subgroups with different emotional moods changed in favor of the negative one. Hence, there were 80 people in an equilibrium state, 63 were positively inclined, and 57 had a negative emotional disposition [Table 3]. This indicates a tendency for the negative emotional mood to increase after the survey on dental status. Significant changes in the hemispheric activity coefficient both before and after treatment were noted for men with positive mood (a 1.1-fold increase, P ≤ 0.01), for women with negative mood (a 1.2-fold increase, P ≤ 0.05), and for men from the same group (a 1.2-fold increase, P ≤ 0.05). There was a direct correlation between the increased scores and emotional disposition among men and women in Group 1, namely 0.72 and 0.73, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Also, a correlation was established between the value of the hemispheric activity factor and the increased scores after the survey was recorded, namely, 0.82 for men and 0.81 for women (P ≤ 0.05). A correlation between an increase in the scores and the values of personal anxiety for men and women was 0.57 and 0.66, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). For reactive anxiety, these indices were 0.56 and 0.57 for men and women, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). As a result, patients in Groups 1 and 2 with removable and fixed dentures differ in anxiety levels. This confirms the hypothesis that the results of the dental health survey generally have a negative impact on the psycho-emotional status of the patient, especially when the local type of anesthesia is used. DISCUSSION This study showed that after the survey on dental status and quality of life was conducted, a significant increase in the hemispheric activity index values was noted among patients in the groups with removable and fixed dentures demonstrated. Hence, the emotional state of the patients changed toward the negative in both groups in general. These changes affected most patients with negative emotional mood prior to the administration of the questionnaire. There was also a dependence on the type of dentures. In Group 2 (with removable dentures), the increase in negative emotions was more pronounced, with the indices of anxiety varying more in male patients. Thus, the survey results can be used to perform a psychodiagnostic of the patient's emotional condition. If the patient scored up to 18 points on the survey, it can be stated that he or she is satisfied with the dental treatment provided. When the number of points ranges from 18.0 to 29.0, the patient can be considered as only partially satisfied with the quality of dental care provided. If a patient scores more than 29 points based on the test results, it can be assumed that they are not satisfied with the dental treatment performed. The behavioral response of patients under local anesthesia in the first group suggested a moderate level of pain. According to the results on the hemispheric activity index, the indicators of negative emotional mood worsened 1.2 times (P ≤ 0.05) for men and women in the group with fixed dentures; however, in the group with removable dentures, this tendency was stronger with 2.2 and 2.1 times, accordingly (P ≤ 0.01). These results are supported by the increased level of anxiety in patients with removable and fixed dentures. No emotional changes were found in any of the controls. The significance of differences between the groups according to the survey results was confirmed by statistical tests and established correlations between the emotional mood and the increase in scores. Among the study limitations, the factor of gender belonging (significant differences obtained for men and women) and the state of the patient's psyche should be particularly considered. In cases where the patient's mental condition may deviate from generally accepted norms (i.e., phobias), the test results may not adequately correspond to the patient's real psycho-emotional state. This was demonstrated in a study that evaluated the stress level of patients with epilepsy during dental procedures.[17] Data from questionnaires administered to 85 patients with epilepsy before elective dental surgery were considered. Dental anxiety was found in 17.6% of patients (n = 15). At the same time, dental anxiety did not correspond to factors such as age, level of education, type of epilepsy, frequency of attacks, use of antiepileptics, and many others. However, a significant correlation was found between gender (P < 0.01) and the type of oral surgery (removal of a retained third molar; P < 0.05) on the one hand and the level of dental anxiety on the other. Similar results were reported in other studies.[1819] A relationship to the gender factor was also established in this study. Results from this study are generally consistent with similar research. Thus, using data on 105 patients (aged 18–23 years) of dental clinics, it was found that different groups demonstrated various anxiety levels expressed in dentophobia and salivary pH changes.[20] Group 1 demonstrated a low level of anxiety and consisted of 33 patients (31.4%). Group 2 included 32 patients (30.5%) with moderate anxiety levels; however, in Group 2 with 40 patients (38.1%), a high anxiety level was recorded.[20] Of the 105 study participants, 85% showed low levels of dentophobia, 27% demonstrated low levels of anxiety, 29% showed moderate anxiety levels, and 28% showed high levels of anxiety. The mean salivary pH of all participants was 6.79 at rest and 6.43 in anxiety.[20] Thus, saliva pH may also be a factor worth considering in such studies. Another study showed that microcirculatory changes can indicate psycho-emotional stress development.[21] The study included 30 patients. The control group consisted of patients without psycho-emotional disorders but with postprosthetic complications after dental implantation. The results obtained showed that the capillary blood flow during stress changes at both oscillatory and nonoscillatory levels. At vasodilatation, an intensification of blood flow and disruption of venous flow was established. Analysis of high- and low-frequency oscillations by wavelet transformations revealed an increase in endothelium activity and a decrease in sympathetic adrenergic vasomotor and precapillary tone. Psycho-emotional stress is, therefore, mostly caused by a physiological factor. The patient's consciousness in dental clinic is a comprehensive relationship with the stimuli received from external and internal receptors. Through the interaction of these receptors, the consciousness forms a kind of emotional background, reflecting the patient's perception of the physical condition.[22232425] Besides, all of the patient's perceptions or experiences about their condition are reflected in the way they relate to their health.[26] In general, such patients can be divided into three groups: with a dismissive attitude, with an adequate attitude, and finally, the group with increased attention to their health.[16] Other data indicate that a negative emotional background is influenced by factors, such as the patient's intelligence, the intensity of pain, and the severity of the ongoing disease or upcoming dental procedure.[2728] Thus, research into the patient's emotional activity type plays an important role in subsequent dental treatment. The predominance of negative emotions, such as irritability, demandingness, and the frustration of their physical sensations, constitute a significant proportion among character traits, which also affect the patient's social life.[29] It is known that among the patients who have agreed to treatment, feelings of fear and pain may increase even before the dental treatment starts. Fear may take different, and often opposing, forms, such as worry, euphoria, and anxiety. Of the techniques used, two approaches are dominant.[22] The first approach is clinical, consisting of analytical conversations with the patient and observing behavioral patterns. The second approach is a laboratory one, which is less costly in time and resources and implies the use of questionnaires. The most commonly used questionnaires are the Eysenck questionnaire, the MMPI, and the MMPI 2. Further, the Eysenck questionnaire links types of temperament, extraversion and introversion, as well as stability and instability. However, most of the questionnaires show different deficiencies. Some of them diagnose a small number of psychoypes, others are too cumbersome, and many do not include psychometric properties. CONCLUSION This study showed that changes in the hemispheric activity index and indicators of personal and reactive anxiety are related to the survey results on the dental status and the type of dental service provided. By the quality-of-life criteria, the values obtained were different according to the emotional mood of the patient. It follows that obtaining reliable information about the patient's satisfaction with the dental care provided, questionnaires on the patient's dental health status are required in addition to the standard psychodiagnostic techniques. The study and analysis of the data obtained allow for the right choice to restore the patient's physical and mental health after receiving dental care. Such a multicomponent approach can greatly enhance the quality of dental treatments and establish the most efficient methods. These results are confirmed by the heightened level of anxiety in patients in groups with removable and fixed prostheses. No change of emotional mood was noted in controls.

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and complex disorder precipitated by exposure to a psychologically distressing event. PTSD first appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980,1,,2 arising from studies of the Vietnam war, and of civilian victims of natural and man-made disasters.3,,4 However, the study of PTSD dates back more than 100 years. Before 1980, post-traumatic syndromes were recognized by different names, including railway spine, shell shock, traumatic (war) neurosis, concentration-camp syndrome, and rape-trauma syndrome.2,,3 The symptoms described in these syndromes overlap considerably with what we now recognize as PTSD. According to the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-IV-TR),5 the essential feature of PTSD is the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor characterized by: direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of another person; or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate. The person reacts to this event with fear and helplessness, and tries to avoid being reminded of it. Traumatic events include military combat, violent personal assault, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration, natural or man-made disasters, automobile accidents, or being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. The principal symptoms of PTSD are the painful re-experiencing of the event, a pattern of avoidance and emotional numbing, and fairly constant hyperarousal.\n\nPost-traumatic reactions fall on a continuum, and many clinicians and researchers believe it is useful to conceptualize partial symptoms as well.2, …",

      "abstract": "Funktionelle Erkrankungen des Magendarmtrakts sind uberaus haufig. Sie sind charakterisiert durch Symptome wie Oberbauchschmerzen, Vollegefuhl etc. sowie durch das Fehlen struktureller Lasionen oder biochemischer Abnormalitaten, die diese Symptome erklaren. Die funktionelle Dyspepsie mit auf den Oberbauch bezogenen chronischen oder chronisch rezidivierenden Symptomen ist dabei eine der wichtigsten Erkrankungen, die in der Klinik Anlass gibt fur endoskopische Untersuchungen.\r\nHinsichtlich der Pathogenese der Symptome wird heute angenommen, dass neben Motilitatsstorungen vor allem Veranderungen der gastrointestinalen Sensorik eine zentrale Rolle einnehmen. So sind bei Patienten im Vergleich zu gesunden Probanden die Schwellen fur die Wahrnehmung und das Auftreten von Beschwerden bei mechanischer Distension des Magens signifikant niedriger als bei gesunden Probanden . Neben Unterschieden hinsichtlich der Wahrnehmungsschwellen sind Patienten gekennzeichnet durch gestorte adaptive Veranderungen der Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation oder einer mukosalen Schleimhautschadigung durch nicht-steroidale Antirheumatika (NSAR). Ziel der vorliegenden Untersuchung war es, den Einfluss opioiderger Bahnen fur die Modulation viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen zu erfassen und die Effekte bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie und gesunden Probanden zu vergleichen. In Ubereinstimmung mit anderen fruheren Arbeiten findet sich bei Gesunden ein Anstieg viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation und Behandlung mit NSAR, wahrend die Schwellen bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie abnehmen. Die Gabe von Naloxon, einem unspezifischen Opioidantagonisten, bewirkt bei Gesunden einen signifikant starker ausgepragten Abfall viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen als bei Patienten. Die Daten lassen insofern den Schluss zu, dass \r\na) bei Patienten offensichtlich antinozizeptive Bahnen nur eingeschrankt funktionstuchtig sind; \r\nb) b) dies auf eine Storung opioiderg vermittelter antinozizeptiver Effekte zuruckzufuhren ist, was die verminderte Antwort auf intravenos appliziertes Naloxon bei Patienten nahe legt.",

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

For the physician, it is a guide to diagnosis itself, and for the patient it is a signal which warns of new conditions of the body and soul or of a disorder. Objectives Mental disorders are most commonly presented by a group of symptoms, among which the patients often can’t point out the leading one. Anxiety as a symptom can occur in a number of psychiatric entities and it can stimulate differential diagnostic dilemma in daily practice. We will show a 26-year female in which the internal anxiety is the main symptom. Aim To underlined the importance of taking in to account a leading symptom of the disease in the way of establishing the correct diagnosis. Methods The psychiatric and psychotherapeutic interviews were performed together with a clinical assessment of mental status and structured clinical interviews (SCID I and SCID II), EEG and psychological testing. Results/conclusion Internal discomfort is a subjective feeling, respectively a symptom which the patient in this case continuously underlined, and which guided us (along with a comprehensive analysis) to a clear diagnosis. Following the choosing of an effective psycho-pharmacological combination, and with the goal of reducing a leading symptom, according to enlarged diagnostic process, we decided to diagnose the Schizoaffective disorders (F 25.2).",

The medical student's first practical learning experience, in which he glimpses the euphemistically named \"continuous-treatment\" ward of a mental hospital, is usually sufficient to indoctrinate him to the viewpoint of inexorableness. When evidence of an optimistic nature cannot be overlooked, it is still interpreted in the framework of rigidity; that is, favorable changes have occurred because the diagnosis of schizophrenia was incorrect, or else these changes have taken place<i>in spite of</i>an",

Extrinsic sleep disorders are caused by transient stress or disruptions in the sleep environment. Jet lag and shift work that temporarily disrupt the normal sleep cycle also are considered to be extrinsic sleep disorders. Daytime sleepiness is a very common presenting symptom. It is important to distinguish excessive daytime sleepiness from alterations in the level of consciousness, such as lethargy. During the night, a sleeper cycles through a series of sleep stages; this is called “sleep architecture.” Rapid-eye-movement sleep is the state in which most, but not all, dreaming experiences occur. Symptoms that seem bizarre and occur in association with nocturnal sleep or daytime napping should be considered as possible expressions of sleep pathology rather than psychopathology.",

However, in the physical impairment related diseases, it is difficult for the disease to occur only by internal factors, and it can be said that internal factors and external factors are combined. Therefore, when the physical impairment is caused by disease, it is important to the apportionment analysis of injury to think about the cause of the physical impairment by considering both the external and internal factors. The most commonly used the apportionment guide is the “Rhim's trauma apportionment guideline” in impairment evaluation. But this guideline is often difficult to assess in certain diseases. Since the apportionment analysis of external factors can bring about a difference in degree according to the viewpoint of the assessor, the degree of the physical impairment may vary greatly depending on case by case. Especially, it is not reasonable to assess based on causal relation with common sense or emotional, and it is necessary to make rational assessment based on medical evidence and professional knowledge.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older.

At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships.

Social factors are the most important determinants of health status. Reducing social adversity and childhood trauma would improve the physical and mental health of the population. Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

These are different sample format describe various symptoms and prevention associate with those symptoms. Genetic activity, genes presence and repetition also gives user activity detail and problems in human body. Mental illness is a type of disease which relate with the mental disorder. It deals in human interaction, its behavior, and its regular and irregular activity. In this stage human sudden start misbehave or extra activities during the particular phase and hence an un-predictable incident may occur. Psychometric disease cases are increasing day by day with different symptoms in human being. These are diseases which occur due to over work pressure, mental activity, some past human life incident or may be the victim of some good or bad incident. It leads to several problems in society, as per well issue with the person who is suffering with the particular disorder. An human interaction and understanding capacity is different than a normal person which keep person separate from the normal society and social life. These disorders also occur sometime very violent and make it very tedious to recover. Psychiatric relate to brain disorder, Mental disorder, irregular work performing in public etc. Diagnosis over the disease is complex and not fixed. In the previous research on the same concern shows that the past data can be analyzed properly and it can further be useful for the precautions. Mental disorder records may leads to several Meta data, report activities observed by hospital or supervision person. A classification over the given symptoms, its action and medical treatment help in diagnosis. Past studies always parts in important role using which further decision can be taken. Mental disorder, mental health, further possibilities can be observed and driven remedy can be discussed. Data classification algorithm makes it possible to classify the normal and abnormal data cases. Hospital release dataset give the information which tends to changes, mental health of previous patients and their best precautions taken to cure them. Different algorithm model is used which help in mining the previous algorithm data rule over the past cases. It enable user to understand past cases, their symptoms, disease occurred and its diagnosis steps taken. Various algorithms such as Genetic algorithm, Naïve bayes, Ant colony optimization, Rule based reasoning (RBR), Case based reasoning (CBR) and Artificial neural network (ANN) is used for psychometric disease finding from the large dataset. In this paper survey of past techniques is performed. This paper also illustrates the work finding and limitation of previous research. An analysis using the real time dataset over the proposed algorithm is left for further work..",

In serious situations, it might show as a dissociative disorder, which extremely impairs psychological functioning. Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Accurate certification of deaths in custody that occur either during or immediately following contact with law enforcement personnel (especially physical contact) involves consideration of one or more modalities of contact. These modalities include physical restraint (hand/ankle cuffing, prone positioning, application of pressure on the torso and/or limbs, maximal prone restraint, application of conducted electrical weapons) and chemical restraints (lacrimal agents/chemical irritants) in the setting of psychotic illness/agitation, struggle/physical exertion, intoxication with stimulant drugs and underlying cardiovascular pathology that can predispose to sudden death. Assessment of these case are often not straightforward, and their certification can be some of the most difficult cases that a forensic pathologist can be faced with in respect to the determination of both cause manner of death. Perceived unfair and/or unpopular certifications of these cases can result in professional criticism, allegations of bias, complicity or bias by certifying pathologist, social dissatisfaction/unrest and violent public protests. Recent deaths in custody in the United States (US) are typical examples of this phenomenon. This Chapter outlines the main clinicopathologic considerations that must occur in the pathologic assessment of these cases",

The index case is presented for highlighting the pathological nature of fantasy friend phenomenon, role of psychological, social and cultural factors in its genesis and its course. Onset and persistence of this phenomenon throughout adolescence, its longer duration and non-recognition of its imaginary component by the patient indicates its pathological nature. The patient developed schizophrenia after experiencing this phenomenon for 12-13 years. It is concluded that pathological fantasy friend phenomenon may carry risk of schizophrenia if continued without any intervention for longer duration. Hence, there is a need to identify and intervene early in such kind of cases. The findings of this case report needs to be corroborated by other case reports or studies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

However, the importance of diet, alcohol, activity, and other concurrent disease also was noted. Perforation usually occurred as a climax to a period of emotional turbulence when the patient faced situations which, consciously or unconsciously, he felt to be grossly damaging to his self-esteem and to which he reacted, predominantly, with impotent rage. The perfection prodrome is described and interpreted as a depressive equivalent. The ulcer patient's ordinal position in his family as the youngest or middle child and his difficulties in relation to his father are emphasized. Particularly where no other serious disease coexists, perforation should be taken as presumptive evidence that the patient has tried unsuccessfully to resolve an emotional crisis and that appropriate psychiatric help probably is indicated as part of the total treatment.",

It is not known to what extent these medical conditions precede or lead to depression. The present study proposes to identify somatic comorbities in a group of patients with major depressive disorder. The results show that many of the comorbidities identified may be metabolic risk factors for the development of other diseases or may even predispose to depression, as suggested by other studies in the literature. Patients with multiple comorbidities have a much higher risk of depression, which requires the implementation of a depression screening program and monitoring of patients at risk. Early and effective treatment leads to a lower mortality rate.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

Uma vez que a vulnerabilidade é agravada por eventos naturais somados a predisposição psicossocial e psicológica. A depressão trata-se de uma perturbação afetiva que culmina com um estado melancólico, mais que pode evoluir com alguns episódios de ansiedade que compartilha algumas características coma tristeza. As causas da maior parte das doenças de ordem psicológica não estão bem esclarecidas. Não existem causas isoladas da depressão, tratando-se assim de uma doença multifatorial, ou seja, não possui fatores causadores específicos que possam ser identificados dentro dos critérios de certeza absoluta científica. Quando surge imediatamente após o parto toma a designação de Depressão Pós-Parto. O estudo tem como objetivo Conhecer os fatores desencadeantes da Depressão Pós-Parto em gestantes no terceiro trimestre e puérperas do 1° ao 3° mês no PSF da cidade do Crato-Ce. Identificar os principais fatores de risco relacionados ao desenvolvimento da Depressão Pós-Parto. A pesquisa e do tipo exploratório-descritivo, com abordagem qualitativa. A população constituiu-se por gestantes no terceiro trimestre de gestação e puérperas de qualquer idade obedecendo aos seguintes critérios de inclusão e exclusão. Para a obtenção de dados junto à amostra, utilizou-se uma entrevista semi-estruturada contendo perguntas abertas e fechadas. Concluímos que se faz necessário um planejamento das equipes para a execução de ações preventivas que proporcionem uma gestação e um puerpério emocionalmente sadios. Essas equipes devem atuar, fundamentalmente, no acompanhamento das mães puérperas atendendo às suas necessidades básicas de saúde e educação, bem como na orientação daquilo que se refere aos cuidados com a criança. Tais atitudes básicas não devem ser específicas da medicina em geral ou da psiquiatria em particular. Elas devem ser realizadas por equipes multiprofissionais da rede básica de saúde treinada para isso.",

If we avoid Cartesian dualism, the claim that mental disorders are biological is obviously a tautology. Given the facts above, psychiatric diagnostic manuals, such as the DSM and ICD, are school examples of what evidence-based science is not and represent nothing but a failed attempt to build a legal road from Health Care to Hell Care by over-medicalization and by the suffering of human and non-human animals.

The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy.

So far, this well-established psychopathological knowledge has been appreciated only insufficiently by the official diagnostic systerms of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV TR) and the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (ICD-10). From a perspective of primary care services, this unmet diagnostic need is deplorable, as the main mode of presenting a depression is by reporting somatic symptoms. This somatic form of presentation, however, significantly contributes to low rates of recognition in primary care. A diagnostic challenge may be seen in the differentiation of a depression with prevailing somatic symptoms from anxiety, somatoform disorders, and medical conditions. When somatic symptoms, particularly painful physical conditions, accompany the already debilitating psychiatric and behavioral symptoms of depression, the course of the illness may be more severe, implying a higher risk of early relapse, chronicity, suicide, or mortality due to other natural causes, the economic burden increases considerably the functional status may be hampered heavily, and health-related quality of life may be lowered dramatically. The neurobiological underpinnings of somatic symptoms in depression may guide more promising treatment approaches.",

      "abstract": "The Concept of Spiritual Emergency T here exists increasing evidence that many individuals experiencing episodes of nonordinary states of consciousness accompanied by various emotional, perceptual, and psychosomatic manifestations are undergoing an evolutionary crisis rather than suffering from a mental disease (Grof, 1985).The recognition of this fact has important practical and theoretical consequences.If properly understood and treated as difficult stages in a natural developmental process, these experiences-spiritual emergencies or transpersonal crises-can result in emotional and psychosomatic healing, creative problem-solving, personality transformation, and consciousness evolution.This fact is reflected in the term \"spiritual emergency,\" which suggests a crisis, but also suggests the potential for rising to a higher state of being.Traditional psychiatry does not recognize the difference between mystical and psychotic experiences.All unusual states of consciousness are essentially seen as pathological and attributed to anatomical, physiological, and biochemical changes in the brain, or other medical causes.There is no acknowledgement that any dramatic experiential states involving changes of consciousness could be potentially therapeutic and transformative.Psychiatry thus routinely and indiscriminately uses controlling and suppressive approaches to terminate such experiences.However, in the case of transpersonal crises, insensitive use of repressive measures can lead to chronicity and long-term dependence on tranquillizing medication or other pharmaceuticals with ensuing serious side effects and impoverishment of personality.It seems, therefore, extremely important to clarify theoretically the concept of transpersonal crises and to develop comprehensive and effective approaches to their treatment.Spiritual emergencies (transpersonal crises) can occur spontaneously without any precipitating factors, or they can be triggered by emotional stress, physical exertion, disease, accident, intense sexual experience, childbirth, or exposure to psychedelic drugs.However, in many instances the catalyzing factor seems to be involvement in various meditative practices which are specifically designed to activate spiritual energies.As spiritual disciplines are gaining popularity in the West, an increasing number of people are experiencing transpersonal crises that can be traced to their practice of yoga, Zen, various movement meditations, pranayama, Kundalini maneuvers, Tibetan Buddhist psychoenergetic exercises, Christian prayer, and other forms of deep and systematic spiritual involvement and self-exploration.Supportive evidence for the concept of spiritual emergency can be drawn from a variety of fields : history, anthropology, comparative religion, clinical psychiatry, modern consciousness research, psychedelic therapy, Jungian psychology, new experiential psychotherapies, and many others.Indirectly, the developments in a variety of scientific disciplines that undermine the Newtonian-Cartesian model of the universe and mechanistic thinking can be used to support the new concepts.Though incompatible with traditional thinking in science, the new approaches are congruent with many important aspects of the emerging paradigm (Grof, 1985). Definition of Spiritual EmergencyT o prevent misunderstanding, it is important to emphasize that not every experience of unusual states of consciousness and intense perceptual, emotional, cognitive, and psychosomatic changes falls into the category of spiritual emergency.The concept of transpersonal crisis is not oriented against traditional psychiatry; it offers an alternative approach to individuals who can benefit from it and are capable and willing to accept it.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Deaths due to positional asphyxia are most often accidental, associated with alcohol and/or drug intoxication. A 19‐year‐old male is reported who was assaulted and placed in a head‐down position in the back of a car were he was later found dead. Brush abrasions indicated that he had been dragged to the vehicle. The head and right shoulder were wedged into the foot well with the body uppermost. At autopsy, there was marked congestion of the face, neck, and upper chest with conjunctival ecchymoses, bruising of the face and scalp, focal subarachnoid hemorrhage, minor cerebral contusion, and diffuse cerebral swelling with early hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ). Toxicology was negative. Death was attributed to HIE resulting from the unusual positioning of the body. Cases of positional asphyxia involving others may not always include restraint, and when encountered should initiate a careful evaluation of the possible events and lethal pathophysiological processes.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

With respect to the distinction between psychological and somatoform manifestations of dissociation current data suggest a hypothesis to which extent mild manifestations of 'pseudoneurological' symptoms in healthy young population may be linked to stress-related psychopathological symptoms or whether these symptoms more likely could be attributed to unexplained somatic factors. With this aim we have assessed the relationship between somatoform dissociation and stress-related psychopathology (i.e. anxiety, depression, symptoms of traumatic stress, alexithymia) in a group of 250 healthy non-psychiatric and non-clinical young adults. Results of this study show that the symptoms of somatoform dissociation are significantly linked to stress-related psychopathology. Findings of this study show that the 'pseudoneurological' symptoms may be linked to stress-related psychopathological processes which indicate that also mild levels of stress may influence somatic feelings and may lead to various somatoform dissociative symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Occasionally, pain after disease or trauma develops only after a prolonged interval. Examples include late-onset pains which first occur months or years following a stroke, spinal cord lesion or amputation of a limb; a previously experienced pain that is recalled years later; and latent pain triggered for the first time by a further insult in the same area. Late-onset pains may develop gradually or suddenly, and may be brief or long standing. Pains which develop after an innocuous insult may be associated with slowly evolving sensory changes. However, even long-standing pains, particularly those of nociceptive origin, may resolve sometimes after many years. Resolution, which again can occur gradually or suddenly, may be spontaneous or follow development of another disorder or after therapeutic intervention. The duration of this pain relief can range from minutes to an indefinite period. These clinical phenomena, and the mechanisms, including genetic factors, subserving them, have been little studied. It is postulated that mechanisms implicated in acute pain may not be the same as those that subserve pain that develops after a long interval. Those late-onset pains which develop slowly after innocuous lesions may be associated with a variety of slow anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes. In late-onset pains that follow a painful insult, however, memory of the former pain and threshold triggering factors may be particularly important. Further studies of these neglected conditions may lead to understanding of as yet unknown processes subserving pain and to novel approaches to treatment.",

Physical sequelae are most common, but also other symptoms can happen, such as neurological symptoms, psychiatric alteration, and cognitive decline. The repercussion of EI can happen whether or not the head is a point of contact with the electrical current. There are no official diagnostic criteria for cognitive repercussions of EI, which may lead to incorrect diagnostics and confusion with other most frequent causes of dementia, such as frontotemporal dementia, pseudodementia, or dementias for reversible causes. In this case report, we described a right-handed man, aged 56 years old, referred to our service due to behavioral changes and cognitive alterations related to electric shock. The psychiatric team has monitored him, but cognitive deficits have raised doubts about the presence of dementia syndrome. The neuropsychological evaluation revealed severe deficits and loss of functionality, which filled the criteria for major neurocognitive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-5). Adding these findings to the patient's history and after a detailed investigation of other causes of dementia, we concluded that this is a possible case of EI with strong neuropsychological symptoms. This case report should help clinicians to recognize this condition and its features. We aimed to share the importance of recognizing the neuropsychological and psychiatric features of EI, mainly in the Brazilian context.",

The early research on stress clearly documented the importance of biological bases of the stress process.

Chronic stressors can cause neural and endocrine change that alters the normal functioning of the organism. The physiological response to stress is also accompanied by behavioural responses.

      "title": "[A relationship under the influence : collusive phenomena in clinics].",
      "abstract": "Collusion is a mostly unconscious phenomenon occurring in the therapeutic relationship, which can be commonly identified in psychiatry but more generally in medicine. Collusion is especially present in circumstances in which the effects of disease and its treatments have a heavy impact on patients and caregivers, and where the stakes are existential. Collusion is triggered by unresolved psychological problems, for example, loss, intimacy or control, which are shared by the patient and the clinician. Collusion, if unrecognized, can seriously hamper the clinician-patient relationship and the care of the patient.La collusion est un phénomène inconscient survenant dans la relation thérapeutique, observable en psychiatrie, mais aussi en médecine. Elle se manifeste surtout dans les domaines où les effets de la maladie et des traitements pèsent lourdement sur les patients et les cliniciens et où les enjeux sont existentiels. L’origine d’une collusion se situe dans des problèmes psychologiques non résolus, en lien avec des thématiques comme la perte, l’intimité ou le contrôle, qui sont partagés par le clinicien et son patient. La collusion, si elle n’est pas reconnue, peut sérieusement entraver la relation clinique et avoir des conséquences négatives sur la prise en charge.",

It is characterized by disturbances in perception, emotional regulation and thought processes, including symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, leading to a disconnection from reality. Patients often suffer when trying to meet the demands of ordinary life. Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in development of psychosis. Besides these, there are also environmental influences, which contribute as a trigger and later progression of psychotic disorders. These external determinants could possibly be managed in attempts to contain the problem of increased mental health conditions with the main psychotic component.

Intoxication, popularly accepted as an etiologic agent in some disturbances of peripheral nerves, is, with the exception of that due to lead, seldom considered at the bedside as the cause of a disease of the brain or the spinal cord. Yet toxic factors, intoxications, undoubtedly cause acute or subacute nervous disorders, which always exhibit definite histopathologic features but only occasionally possess a suggestive clinical picture. For this reason many disorders of the central nervous system remain undiagnosed and consequently improperly treated.

      "title": "Neuropsychiatric disorders: post-stroke depression. A review",
      "abstract": "Introduction Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common neuropsychiatric disorder after stroke, and also the main factor limiting recovery and rehabilitation in stroke patients, which leaded to poor quality of life. A prevalence of 30% is estimated between 1 to 5 years after stroke. More than half of all cases are neither diagnosed nor treated. Objectives The aim of this paper is to review the latest updates regarding post-stroke depression and progress in its diagnosis and treatment. Methods A systematic review of the scientific and clinical literature on PSD was conducted. The review included databases such as PubMed and Cochrane, covering articles from the past 10 years. The scientific evidence obtained was analyzed and synthesized. Results Currently, the diagnosis of PSD is mainly based on the DSM guidelines and combined with various depression scales. Symptoms usually occur within the first three months after stroke, the patient presents symptoms of a depressive episode such as low mood, anhedonia, loss of appetite, sleep disorders, vegetative symptoms or social withdrawal. Several mechanisms, including biological, behavioural, and social factors, are involved in its pathogenesis. The main predictors are personal history or cognitive impairment, as well as sequelae of the stroke. Left hemispheric strokes are those with the highest risk of early depression, as well as small subcortical vessel pathology. Treatment is mainly pharmacological, with SSRIs. The probability of recovery is between 15 and 57% in the first year, with a recurrence of 38% at two years, up to 100% at 15 years. In addition, there is an increase in mortality, especially in those under 65 years of age. Conclusions There are still many unanswered questions in the treatment of PSD, such as the best time to start treatment or the effects of antidepressants on cognition and motor function, among others. Although great advance has been made by researchers, the mechanism of PSD is not completely clear. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

A case is presented of a young male suicide victim whose antemortem course did not demonstrate apparent psychopathology to either his family or fellow students. A journal written by the decedent was found, however, which revealed extensive ruminations on death, depressive symptomatology, and evidence of possible delusions, and hallucinations. We opine that this represents the prodrome of a psychotic process, possibly schizophrenia, and the decedent’s suicide was a response to his awareness of his deteriorating mental status. The prodrome of schizophrenia is a well-described entity that manifests as a decline in social and occupational functioning, along with increasingly bizarre behavior. Prodromal psychosis could represent an explanation for some cases of suicide seemingly without causation.",

The insidious, chronic course of most sleep disorders and lack of patient awareness of signs and symptoms during sleep can complicate the clinical evaluation. Typical chief complaints include snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and behaviors during sleep. Sleep disorders can be primary or secondary to medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is often desirable. Family members can be a critical source of information as they may have observed nocturnal or daytime symptoms unrecognized by the patient. Objective testing plays an important role in assessment for obstructive sleep apnea, parasomnias, and other specific sleep disorders, and can be used most effectively in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation. Nonsleep specialists should consider obtaining assistance from sleep clinicians for more challenging presentations or management of sleep disorders unfamiliar to them.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

      "abstract": "In electric convulsive therapy the first'clinical improvement is frequently followed by an acute psychotic picture which is an organic reaction caused by the treatment. Not only are such disturbances of practical importance for the correct application of electric convulsive therapy, but they have many theoretic implications of great interest. The much discussed impairment of memory is the most constant, but never the only, organic mental symptom during electric convulsive therapy. Careful examination will reveal equally early symptoms in the emotional sphere. In a fair number of patients more dramatic syndromes develop. These always have certain characteristic features which permit their diagnosis as organic psychotic reactions implanted on the psychosis for which the patient is being treated; they disappear within one or two weeks after the last treatment. Their misinterpretation often leads to untimely cessation of treatment or, more frequently, to its unnecessary prolongation because of symptoms which are mistaken for",

      "title": "PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDERS IN ADOLESCENTS",
      "abstract": "Psychotherapy of psychosomatic disorders in adolescents is one of the most responsible tasks a therapist could undertake. The psychosomatic spectrum of disorders in children aged between 5 and 18 years is widespread. The similarity between the various symptoms lies in the fact that they are masked gratified desires, but not in an adequate but neurotic manner. Psychotherapy should be approached individually and the personality traits and characteristics of adolescents should be taken into account. This article looks at some of the most common disorders and the causes of them. The focus is not on eliminating the symptom, but on the cause of it. Many clients have serious difficulties in understanding the full dynamics of a psychosocial syndrome. Psychosomatic disorders belong to a larger group known as psychogenic diseases, which can generally be considered as physical diseases caused or modified by the brain for purely psychological reasons. Psychosomatic pain is often due to hidden emotions. Grief, stress, and anxiety can all occur physically. If the patient has recently had a traumatic experience, this may give the therapist an idea of where these symptoms originate. Other times, the root of the problem may be less obvious. People who have experienced deep emotional trauma in the past may have buried those emotions, which would be expressed through physical pain years, even decades later. A remnant of anger and rage from childhood that has never been expressed can be a serious cause of a psychosomatic symptom or illness. For example sexual, physical or emotional abuse, parental problems, including alcoholism, depression, anxiety, drug addiction, psychosis, unrealistic parental expectations of the child, social tension, and others resulting from self-imposed tension (i.e. internal conflict), stress and tension from everyday life. Let us not forget that psychosomatic manifestations, in the form of physical symptoms, can be a protective mechanism of the brain. The brain diverts attention to the body to prevent the awareness of confrontation of some unconscious, repressed or threatening feelings, in particular anger/rage. Once the individual accepts this explanation and is aware of the brain's strategy for diverting attention from emotions to the body, the physical symptoms may disappear. Often there is no medical explanation for the symptoms - there is a pain but no evidence of illness. Symptoms begin when a person reaches their physical and emotional limits. This limit is specific to each person. Psychoanalysts speak of a psychosomatic personality type. Psychosomatic disorder is a way of coping with illness. Symptoms are an indicator of an overall imbalance and a need for personality harmonization.",

Independent depression syndrome describes a patient who meets criteria for major depression or dysthymia, and it is clear in the history that the depression is independent of effects of substances. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) introduced substance-induced depression to recognize the existence of syndromes of depression that cannot be established to be independent, but that nonetheless appear to exceed the usual effects of substance intoxication or withdrawal and require clinical attention. A number of other psychiatric disorders e.g. bipolar disorder, ADHD, PTSD, and some other anxiety disorders, antisocial and borderline personality, co-occur with substance-use disorders and may account for some of the association between depression and substance abuse. Chronic medical disorders, especially those producing chronic pain, also need to be considered.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Parasomnias are disorders that may appear during sleep with and/or without dreams. To describe them we must take in account a subjective description by the patient and his relatives. Objective measurement of this phenomenology is made with Polysomnography, Electromyography and Holter EKG. Material and Methods: We searched the recent data about parasomnia in the Medline, Pubmed, Google academic databases as also in classic books and reviews. Results: The clinical picture is various from motor and neurological signs to autonomic signs as also sleep related hallucinations. There are more rare presentations with associated disorders due to excretion and involuntary urinary emission during sleep disorders. Parasomnias are often preceded by a traumatic event for the patient and his family members which can be a head trauma or an infection or an intoxication which can be accompanied by psycho vulnerable events. On the other part parasomnias can be themselves a preamble announcing neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson disease, Lewy Body Dementia or some synucleopathies. Conclusions: The fluctuations of neurotransmitters (Dopamine, Serotonine or Acetylcholine) due to specific neurologic pathology can lead to particular parasomnias, their evolution corresponding to each impairment. The knowledge of accompanying parasomnias of neurologic disorders like those from Parkinson disease helps manage diseases of neurological patients already known with Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases, leading to increased quality of life for these patients as a result of specialized intervention.",

      "abstract": "Syncope in the aviation environment can be a very difficult problem to assess. Even more difficult is the differential diagnosis between convulsive syncope and epilepsy after the first event. This paper discusses syncope in general and the differential diagnosis between vasovagal syncope and other forms of syncope. About 50% of all syncopal episodes cannot be identified as to etiology. However, a benign outcome for a single syncopal episode, non-cardiac in origin, is the norm. The diagnosis of syncope is discussed, emphasizing that a meticulous history from an observer or the patient, a good physical examination, and an ECG are the cornerstones of diagnosis. Other diagnostic venues are discussed. Convulsive syncope occurs in only about 12% of syncopal episodes, 65% of these being vasovagal in origin. The other 35% are due to a variety of causes. We found no good algorithm to differentiate convulsive syncope from epilepsy. We reviewed the literature to develop a differential diagnostic table, focusing on: age, awake status, position, emotional/physiologic stressors, onset, aura, appearance, injury on falling, seizure characteristics, automatism, length of unconsciousness and subsequent confusion, pulse characteristics, blood pressure, urinary incontinence, seizure duration, recovery time post-event, post-seizure sequelae, amnesia, posture vs. recovery, EEG characteristics, and the value of sophisticated diagnostic procedures.",

It presents a small series of neurological patients with severe emotional disturbances. Even in cases where an organic aetiology is indisputable, physiological factors can only be invoked to explain somatic symptoms and the physiological correlates of mental symptoms. The mental symptoms themselves can only be understood psychologically. There can be no doubt that mental phenomena are somehow related to physical and chemical processes. A moment's reflection reveals the futility of seeking the cause of a suicidal melancholia, for example, in a CT scan. A scan or an angiogram, or whatever, can only reveal the cause of the stroke. A stroke therefore has different psychological implications for different patients, who have different resources available for dealing with them.",

In psychosexual medicine, every patient is unique and the approach to identifying and elucidating the nuances of each patient's story will vary from case to case.

Such patients complain of increased urination (pollakiuria), urinary incontinence (enuresis), urinary retention, or loss of urination. As a rule, for the first time, such patients turn to a pediatrician (therapist), then to a urologist who, after a comprehensive examination, excludes any organic violation of the genitourinary system. Psychogenic dysuria can be noted in the structure of general neurosis, be a somatoform disorder, or be a neurotic (usually conversion) monosymptom. Hysterical (conversion) disorders, by definition, are not simulative, but manipulative, representing either a way to draw attention to your person, which is typical for females, or being a kind of unconscious way out of a hopeless from the patients point of view situation, as it was in this case. For the same reasons, the treatment of patients with hysteria remains one of the most difficult problems, requiring the involvement of a specialized specialist a psychotherapist or psychiatrist. Integrative psychotherapy (rational, behavioral and suggestive) is quite effective here, however, long-term treatment is usually required to achieve a good effect. Which consists of consultation with confrontational and paradoxical techniques, and the way out of such a confrontation is usually the same behavioral therapy and 510 sessions of hypnotherapy. The given clinical example is of scientific and practical interest, since the full effect was achieved after the first consultation and one session of hypnotic suggestive therapy.",

      "abstract": "In the context of the medical assessment of officers-to-be, the physical and mental aptitude of persons having revealed a psychotherapeutic or psychiatric pretreatment is frequently questioned. Generally, the fact that a person took up a specific therapy because of psychic disturbance doesn't tell anything about severeness and relevance of an underlying mental disorder. If evidence of psychiatric disease arises during the medical examination, an additional expert advice should be obtained to differentiate between mild or reversible dysfunctions and severe or chronifying psychiatric diseases. In the light of a growing social acceptance of psychotherapy, the finding of a prior psychotherapeutic or psychiatric treatment without regarding the individual background, course and prognosis cannot longer justify the exclusion from officialdom.",

      "title": "Factitious Disorders and Trauma-Related Diagnoses",
      "abstract": "The recent plethora of lawsuits involving allegations of iatrogenically implanted memories of satanic ritual abuse and other traumas has highlighted the existence of a unique group of psychiatric patients. Although these patients are often successful at deceiving therapists (and sometimes juries), the case studies in this special issue reveal the chronic nature of their propensity to invent traumatic identities and past histories. The core clinical features of affect dysregulation, somatization, and impaired object relations, together with frequent histories of alcohol and substance abuse, parallel the psychiatric co-morbidity frequently found in genuine trauma victims. These case studies also point to early childhood problems in attachment, and sometimes to real childhood trauma, as possible etiologic factors. The current diagnostic system does not adequately capture the full range of these patients' psychopathology, which involves the creation of factitious identities and fictional traumatic personal histories. The particulars of these histories change over time as the patients incorporate, deliberately and/or “unconsciously,” details derived from outside sources. Although clearly susceptible to being influenced by authority figures of all kinds, it is evident from these case studies that the core psychopathology at work here is intrinsic to the patients and not the by-product of therapeutic misadventure.",

Curiously enough, compared with other functional symptomatology, somehow this disturbance has been neglected in literature until now. Urologists, surgeons, and internists have more difficulties than psychiatrists to find out that distinct emotional conflicts and especially unsatisfactory sexual adjustment might have contributed to the development of recurrent or chronic urinary retention which they vainly tried to explain by organic findings. Of course the fact that extensive medical evaluations or even surgical procedures revealed no abnormality except the stout urinary bladder never is suifficient to qualify for \"hysterical disease\". Every diagnosis has to be established on positive grounds. Hypothetic explanations of mysterious syndromes by supposing more \"microscopic\" and thus undetected morphological deficiencies and changes as the crucial cause of a disease never should become the protective trick by which a physician avoids confrontation with his patients' psychological problems.",

      "title": "Un diagnostic \"psy\" invisible : le cas du trouble d'adaptation",
      "abstract": "Le trouble d'adaptation (TA) est un diagnostic defini par le DSM comme une reaction psychologique a un evenement de vie penible. Sa prevalence clinique est relativement elevee en premiere ligne medicale ou il fait parfois figure de diagnostic officieux de « depression mineure » et d' « epuisement professionnel ». Bien que le TA soit un diagnostic frequemment utilise en clinique medicale, il demeure relativement peu etudie. A peine une centaine de publications scientifiques abordent le diagnostic dans des revues savantes depuis son introduction en 1980. Un tel chiffre contraste avec les milliers d'etudes menees sur les autres diagnostics psychiatriques dont la prevalence est comparable, notamment la depression majeure. Cette faible attention scientifique portee au TA interpelle plusieurs chercheurs. La principale hypothese retenue jusqu'a maintenant pour expliquer ce phenomene est le caractere non specifique de la definition du TA qui entrainerait des obstacles methodologiques significatifs. Cependant, plusieurs autres attributs du diagnostic paraissent susceptibles de limiter son etude, dont sa nature relativement benigne vis-a-vis des autres troubles psychiatriques. Afin d'eclaircir les raisons derriere la faible attention scientifique portee au TA, nous avons procede a une analyse de contenu thematique de la litterature scientifique abordant specifiquement le diagnostic. Nous avons ainsi recolte cent quinze textes publies dans des revues savantes depuis trente ans ayant l'expression « trouble d'adaptation » dans leur titre. Apres categorisation des textes scientifiques et identification des principales dimensions substantives associees au TA, nous avons pu degager les principaux attributs du diagnostic susceptibles de repondre a notre question de recherche. Cette etude, qui propose un regard sociologique inedit sur le diagnostic du TA, laisse voir que la faible attention scientifique dont il est l'objet est le produit de plusieurs facteurs. D'abord, bien que defini par la psychiatrie, l'objet d'etude que represente TA se derobe vraisemblablement de cette specialite medicale par son profil phenomenologique mineur, par l'absence de substrat biologique associe ainsi que par l'approche pharmacotherapeutique minimale qu'on preconise a l'egard du diagnostic. Ensuite, l'ambiguite fondamentale qui caracterise le TA, le savoir tacite du DSM que requiert son etude ainsi que le benefice que le diagnostic retire d'une forme d'invisibilite contribuent aussi a reduire l'extension de la recherche a son endroit. \r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : trouble d'adaptation, diagnostic, depression, clinique, psychiatrie",

In some neuromuscular disorders, these symptoms may not necessarily be induced by exercise and they are usually part of a wide constellation of symptoms. Some of them are distinct enough to be recognized clinically or electrophysiologically, as in peripheral neuropathies, myotonias, or syndromes of continuous muscle activity.

Proprietary and open-source clinical examination tools are available, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Mini-Cog. Physician judgment is necessary in selecting the most appropriate tool for an individual patient. These tools have varying sensitivity and specificity for neurologic and psychiatric disorders, but none are diagnostic for any mental status disorder. Each must be interpreted in the context of physician observation. The mental status examination is useful in helping differentiate between a variety of systemic conditions, as well as neurologic and psychiatric disorders ranging from delirium and dementia to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. There are no guidelines to direct further testing in the setting of an abnormal mental status examination; therefore, testing is based on clinical judgment.",

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

The Supreme Court of Korea has sometimes tried to take into account of mental and emotional injuries in determining whether the defendant has imposed `bodily injuries` on the victim. However, it still hesitates to announce that mental injury is a part of bodily injuries. To the contrary, the United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines state that: “bodily injury” means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation. Impairment of a function of mental faculty will be counted on finding criminal liability under the guidelines. Too many victims are suffering from mental and emotional injuries after the criminal accident. Typical symptoms are including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder but the victims are not qualified for the compensation from the government. Furthermore, the criminal courts do not care about what has visibly happened on the brains of criminal victims. They are often ignoring recent developments in the neuro-science, which clearly shows that mental defects are resulted from the criminal act on the victims. We need to re-define what is injury. Imposing mental illness on victim must be punished on a charge of injuring. It will help the criminal victims recover from the post-traumatic symptoms and get back to their daily lifes.",

      "title": "Social trauma : consequences of emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection in subjects with social anxiety disorder",
      "abstract": "A history of child maltreatment is associated with psychopathology, predominantly affective and anxiety disorders as well as substance abuse. In the past, research has primarily focused on the consequences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect or combinations of these types of maltreatment. However, besides physical and sexual transgressions, child maltreatment does also involve emotional abuse and emotional neglect. Although it was suggested that the consequences of emotional maltreatment might be as severe as the outcomes of physical or sexual maltreatment, there is little knowledge about the unique effects of emotional maltreatment on psychopathology. However, there is a growing body of evidence for an association of emotional maltreatment by caretakers and psychopathology, particularly social anxiety.\r\nIn addition to emotional maltreatment that involves abuse and neglect by parents and other caretakers, emotional abusive treatments (also referred to as emotional victimization) are highly prevalent among peers. Similar to emotional maltreatment by parents or caretakers, emotional peer victimization contributes to various forms of general psychopathology, e.g., depression, anger-hostility, dissociation, and drug use. However, peer victimization is particularly associated with characteristics of social anxiety disorder.\r\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder, which is characterized by persistent fear of social or performance situations, fear of negative evaluation, social avoidance of general and new situations, as well as physiological symptoms in social situations. However, the mechanisms that associate emotional maltreatment by caretakers as well as peers and social anxiety are still unknown. Models of cognitive vulnerability suggest that negative learning experiences establish associative information structures in memory that activate various stereotype and pathological behavioral programs in similar situations. This conceptualization predicts that social events may provoke more intense reactions in emotional maltreated subjects as such situations trigger associative response elements of social traumatic experiences. \r\nA key element of emotional maltreatment is social rejection. Experiences of social rejection elicit negative mood, emotional distress, and activity of neural networks that are associated with the processing of physical pain. However, because physiological reactions to social rejection were found to be ambiguous, there remains a need for clarification of the impact and direction of social rejection on other physiological measures such as heart rate and skin conductance. In socially anxious subjects, social rejection elicited immediate and delayed effects on psychological outcomes. Therefore both, physiological reactions in healthy subjects as well as increased psychological reactions in socially anxious subjects were suggested in previous studies. However, a combination of these, i.e., an investigation of physiological reactions in socially anxious subjects, was not presented, yet. This might be of specific interest, as fear of social rejection is one of the core components of social anxiety. Accordingly, socially anxious subjects should present stronger and prolonged physiological reactions to social rejection.\r\nHowever, there is so far minimal evidence that experiences of aversive social situations evoke an associative network and an activation of associative memory processing. The aim of the present work was to address this point and to explore the impact of prior emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection. In addition, it was assumed that associative memory representations are potential links between maltreatment and social anxiety disorder. Thus, the effect of a history of emotional maltreatment on the experience of potential traumatic social events was expected to be even stronger for subjects with SAD.\r\nIn a first step, the association of emotional maltreatment with social anxiety was examined. Results indicate a relation of childhood maltreatment with psychopathology, and in particular, social anxiety symptoms. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the relative impact of emotional forms of abuse and neglect might even be higher than indicated by previous research on child maltreatment, which had mainly focused on physical and sexual types of abuse and neglect. Moreover, emotional maltreatment mediated the association of physical maltreatment and social anxiety. In addition to emotional maltreatment through parents and other caretakers, reports of emotional peer victimizations were independently related to social anxiety symptoms. Thus, it was concluded that symptoms of social anxiety are mainly predicted by emotional types of victimization, either in childhood through the caretakers, or during childhood and adolescence through peers.\r\nAs a second step, physiological reactions to social rejection were examined in healthy subjects. The results suggest that social rejection evokes reactions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) apparent in accelerated heart rates. Although the effects of social rejection did not imply changes of skin conductance levels, it was concluded that the autonomic nervous system is affected by experiences of social exclusion indicating that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. \r\nAfter that the link between social rejection and physiological reactions had been established, it was examined whether these reactions are affected by histories of emotional maltreatment and symptoms of social anxiety. Data suggested that reactions to an episode of social exclusion were primarily influenced by the degree of relational peer victimization rather than by the diagnosis of SAD. While an increase in skin conductance immediately after the exclusion was observed for all groups of subjects, this physiological response was attenuated among the subjects with a history of peer victimization.\r\nIn general, the results provided evidence for the existence and significance of associative networks and associative memory processing that is established by experiences of emotional maltreatment. In line with memory models of traumatic events and network models of emotional processing, a history of emotional maltreatment altered physiological reactions to a social challenge. After it has been demonstrated that experiences of emotional maltreatment place individuals at risk for symptoms of social anxiety disorder, findings indicate that associative information processing may account for an enhanced cognitive vulnerability for social anxiety. Although the mechanisms involved remain uncertain, it may be speculated that altered physiological reactivity in subjects with a history of emotional maltreatment contributes to the development of social anxiety. \r\nImportantly, the findings of the present research highlight the role of emotional forms of abuse and neglect in the development of a wide range of psychological disorders. Besides the impact of emotional maltreatment on social anxiety, the present research suggested influences of emotional maltreatment on various types of psychopathology. These findings establish a cross-diagnostical perspective on the consequences of emotional maltreatment. Assuming that experiences of emotional abuse and neglect account for various forms of symptomatology, it may be speculated that a plurality of patients would benefit from treatments that address these experiences. Therefore, the development of therapeutic interventions that combine disorder-specific treatments with an approach that focuses on adverse life experiences including social trauma should be a main goal of future clinical research.",

Catatonia is associated with psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia, major depression, encephalitis, and bipolar disorder. The physiopathology of catatonia is complex and not fully understood.

FNS are involuntary and unwanted and are clinically significant because of associated disability. Functional seizures are one of the most common functional neurological presentations.

Determining whether these consequences of stroke may be improved by treatment of depression constitutes both a major challenge and an enormous opportunity for new approaches to poststroke pharmacotherapy.

Contrary evidence, however, suggests that dysphoric mania may be a form of typical mania, a stage-related or severe form of mania, or a transitional state between mania and depression. Because the evidence may be inconsistent because of varying definitions of dysphoric mania among studies, the authors propose preliminary operational diagnostic criteria for the future study of dysphoric mania.",

There is always a risk of suicide. In psychiatry, termination of pregnancy is very important as it can be a reason of developing psychopathology. The identified psychopathological symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria of post-traumatic stress disorder which are considered a post-abortion syndrome. Psychopathology is distinguished by its personal, spiritually painful and stigmatized character. In the course of more than thirty years of clinical practice I have met, and medical documentation describes, about five hundred cases of post-abortion syndrome in Lithuania. The problem of termination of pregnancy exposes the tragic situation of family relations and discloses the destructive effects of the lack of love and warmth between nearest and dearest people, the poverty of sexual life, a woman's slavish behavior and dependence on a man.The topic has been highly syigmatized in Lithuania.

      "abstract": "Depression is a major disorder of mood characterized by a persistent dysphoria, anxiety, irritability, fear, brooding, appetite and sleep disturbances, weight loss, psychomotor agitation or retardation, decreased energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty in concentrating or thinking, possible delusions and hallucinations, and thoughts of death or suicide.The disorder, which occurs in children, adolescents, and adults, may develop over a period of days, weeks, or months.We call it the four step viscous cycle of Incidence, Prevalence, Mortality and Lifetime risk.The reasons could be many specifically categorizing them into environmental, psychological and genetic causes.Episodes may occur in clusters or singly, separated by several years of normality.The causes of the disorder are multiple and complex and may involve biological, psychological, interpersonal, and sociocultural factors that lead to an unidentifiable intra psychic conflict.Treatment includes use of antidepressants like FETZIMA and electroconvulsive therapy, followed by long-term psychotherapy.Nursing care is needed to ensure adequate nutrition, appropriate balance of fluid intake and output, good personal hygiene, and protection of the patient from self-injury.It is also called major affective disorder or unipolar disorder.Genetically triggered determinants leading to Major Depressive Disorders include diseases like Dysthymia, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, etc. Environmental changes play a major role in bringing psychological changes in a person thereby leading to various kinds of changes in their attitude which might take the shape of Major Depressive Disorder.All of these various environmental, psychological and genetic factors which give rise to depression shall be further discussed in the paper.",

      "title": "BIOCHEMISTRY OF THE PSYCHONEUROSES— A REVIEW",
      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

Epidemiological and clinical studies show that depression and schizophrenia are associated with impairment of sexual function and satisfaction, even in untreated patients. Most antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs have adverse sexual effects but it is difficult accurately to identify the incidence of treatment-emergent dysfunction, as disturbances can be reliably detected only from systematic enquiries made at baseline and during treatment. Growing awareness of the adverse effects of psychotropic drugs has led to attempts to use adjuvants or substitute treatments to resolve sexual dysfunction. More studies of the effects of antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs on sexual function are needed.",

This is most obvious in those disorders that result from morphological alterations of the brain structure due to a noxious agent or event, or due to a neurobiological deficit that seriously affects the organization and development of the brain.",

It is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, accounting for approximately one quarter of general practice consultations and half of all outpatient attendances and hospital admissions in the UK (Royal College of Physicians, 1996). For some people, persistent pain is an unrelieved condition of daily life. Yet despite the prevalence of chronic and debilitating conditions, indices of social well-being seldom include pain as a factor affecting the quality of life. Pain is commonly seen as a symptom of other complaints rather than an adversity in itself. Although injury and disease can be detected by observation and clinical tests, pain is a peculiarly private experience that cannot be reduced to anything else; it cannot be x-rayed, or calibrated like blood pressure on a standardized scale, nor can we feel another's pain. Unlike most other states of consciousness, pain has no object or referential content: it is not of anything or for anything, nor can it be easily defined. We commonly resort to suggestive metaphors to describe what we feel in terms of something else — as a 'shooting', 'burning', 'throbbing', 'gnawing' sensation. Sometimes the sheer intensity of what we feel seems to defy language and we can only speak of 'excruciating', 'unbearable' or 'indescribable' pain.KeywordsChronic PainPersistent PainDiscursive PracticeMedical DiscourseReal BodyThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "title": "What attitude towards a patient with somatoform disorder?",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

Herein this term is redefined, and an additional term, parahallucinations, is introduced. Hallucinations are defined as sensory perceptions that have the compelling sense of reality of true perceptions but that occur without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ and are experienced as following the sensory path, that is, can be localized in three-dimensional space outside the body. Pseudohallucinations are defined as hallucinatory phenomena that do not follow the sensory path and are experienced predominantly by psychiatrically ill subjects. Parahallucinations are defined as hallucinatory phenomena that occur due to an injury or abnormality to the peripheral nervous system. Insight into the reality of these experiences-the realization that they are not real-is not felt to be important in their phenomenology.Utilization of this classification system during clinical investigations will yield greater insight into the pathophysiology, course, treatment, and prognosis of psychiatric and neurologic disorders.",

It is possible that somatic symptoms without clear medical causes may reflect psychosocial stress, but it is difficult to discern whether the psychosocial issues preceded the somatic complaints or were a result of them. Making an accurate diagnosis is difficult, and broaching such a subject with patients and their families is a delicate matter. More research is needed to determine appropriate screening tools for identifying cases where psychosocial stress may play a relevant role in symptom presentation, as well as potential treatment modalities for such cases.",

This also has treatment implications in old age. Case presentation: A 65-year-old female who presented with mood and psychotic symptoms pose diagnostic dilemma. Careful history, collateral examination and continual exploration were done for accurate diagnosis and proper management. Due to overlapping symptoms, the initial diagnosis of psychotic depression was revised to paranoid schizophrenia. Eventually, the detailed examination, neurological and laboratory work up were done and the treatment approach was adjusted. The diagnostic dilemma appeared during the initial stage of the late onset psychosis due to affective symptoms. This case emphasises the critical role of clinical acumen in identifying the possibility of schizophrenia and other psychoses, ruling out organic aetiology and balancing the need of psychotropic drugs in old age.",

      "abstract": "The pathology of epilepsy is a complex and evolving field, reflecting both rapid developments in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, and the continued difficulties in translating electrical and functional phenomena into traditional categories of morphological disease. A seizure is an acute neurological event due to sudden excessive disorderly discharge of neurons.1 Lesions that are presumed to cause seizures can be either structural, definable by morphological techniques such as radiology and anatomic pathology, or functional, definable by clinical localization, electrophysiology, and, in some cases, functional imaging defining a focus. Causality is inferred by correlation of morphological findings and location with clinical and electrophysiological data and, in some cases, by the cessation of subsequent seizures after removal of the lesion or focus. Epilepsy is intermittent recurrence of seizures. The finding of structural lesions in some forms of epilepsy suggests and supports causality, but our understanding of the chain between the definable structural lesion and the recurrence of seizures is often less clear.2 Causality may be particularly difficult to determine in conditions producing multiple structural lesions such as tuberous sclerosis, where one lesion is epileptogenic and other similar lesions are not. Even determining how a particular electrically active focus propagates to evolve into a particular seizure or series of intractable seizures is also incompletely understood. To add to the difficulty, seizures or epilepsy itself can be causal, resulting in progressive brain damage and self-perpetuating seizures, particularly in some forms of temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, some treatments for epilepsy themselves have been associated with some forms of brain damage.",

Other causes may also be cardiovascular disease, medication, leg pathology, psycho-pathologic processes (psychogenic dizziness), etc. In our Dizziness Clinic, 3427 patients 70 years of age or older were evaluated and an accurate diagnosis was possible in 76.25 percent of cases. Dizziness specific to aging was not identified, although at times dizziness was more serious than in younger patients due either to weakness because of aging or to more than one cause of dizziness. Thus dizziness and vertigo in aging have to be investigated carefully and similarly to other age groups. To this effect, the history, the clinical examination, and the follow-up are the most essential tools available to the practicing physician.",

The symptoms may vary from discomfort and pain to decreased body function and invalidity. Although it is not clear to what extent MSDs are caused by work, their impact on working life is huge.

      "abstract": "Summary There is a popular conviction that psychological disturbance is invariably a reaction to environmental events. This approach is associated with total rejection of the so-called ‘medical model’. However, allowance must be made for the fact that contemporary knowledge of psychiatric illness is well behind what is now known about general medicine, and current ideas about psychiatric aetiology may be emotionally determined to give satisfying concepts which are often almost impossible to refute. By tracing the progress of some hypotheses in general medicine, as they developed in the past, there are similarities with some current observations about the methods of action of physical treatments in psychiatry, treatments which have been discovered empirically. There is a widespread assumption that psychological responses relate precisely to the degree of evoking stress or the patient's personal attitudes to the stress. However, emotional responsiveness may show an intrinsic individual variation so that many patients who over-respond to stress may do so because of enhanced responsiveness rather than necessarily because psychological events have brought about a state of vulnerability. The exclusively dynamic approach to psychiatry has been perhaps unnecessarily encouraged by naming an illness ‘endogenous depression’ which could well be a primarily physical metabolic disturbance in the central nervous system but which happens to present with prominent depression, as well as other abnormalities. The emphasis on the component of depressed mood artificially delineates the illness and tends to impede consideration of its wider implications.",

      "abstract": "The word depression is being used to describe both a symptom and an illness.The symptom is the experience of gloom, despondency, sadness, grief; the feeling of being run down, dispirited, miserable, melancholic, in the dumps, or of being low.The richness of our language in synonyms for depression may be taken as an indication of its frequency.It is an emotional experience, though sometimes it is described as an empti- ness or flatness, seemingly a loss rather than a lowering of affect.Depression, like anxiety, is a universal experience, and we regard it as abnormal only if it appears without reason or if it seems excessive in its degree or duration in relation to the pro- vocation.Not surprisingly such a common feeling may be associated with any psychiatric syndrome; the depressive dis- orders are those in which the depressed affect appears to be the primary phenomenon or at any rate one of the more prominent of the clinical features.Broadly there are two depressive entities-endogenous depres- sion, which is a variant of manic-depressive illness, and neurotic depression.In practice the differentiation of these two condi- tions is often difficult, but this is not surprising when we recall that any primary psychiatric disturbance may be associated with secondary or reactive features, and of these depression is one of the more common.A convenient though over-simplified view that attempts to quantify this relationship suggests that in any individual case we can regard the patient a. showing say-to give an example-40% endogenous and 60% reactive or neurotic depression.If so, one should not forget that irre- spective of the magnitude of the figures it is the endogenous component that is important, for the remainder is a reaction to it.Successful treatment of the endogenous component is likely to lead to total recovery, whereas treatment directed only at the reactive component can hardly be more than partly successful.The term \" atypical depression \" has been applied to some of these cases.It is only in the last 10 or 15 years we have come to appre- ciate how common is depressive illness.Watts' estimated that in general practice one could expect that of every 1,000 patients 12 would present as revw cases each year.Older figures, largely hospital derived and therefore making little allowance for milder cases, suggest that the incidence of endogenous depression alone is 1% in males and 2% in females.It would be unwise to suggest that depressive illness has become more common in the last 10 years ; the much larger number of cases seen reflects the fact that we have learned to recognize its milder forms. Endogenous DepressionLet us take endogenous depression first.Though less common and less likely to be overlooked, the more severe cases will be described first.The onset is usually gradual, the patient often looks ill, his skin may be sallow and dry, the hair lustreless, and",

Attention to categorical entities such a major depression or anxiety disorders will alert the clinician to comorbid psychiatric disorders that respond to traditional psychiatric treatments.

A depressive episode in the course of BPAD is characterised by the frequent coexistence of psychotic symptoms, excessive sleepiness and increased appetite. The first episode of the disease most often occurs at a young age. Apart from the typical symptoms of the depressive syndrome, we often observe accompanying cognitive disorders, which represent a group of symptoms causing significant discomfort and suffering to the patient. They most often intensify with the development of the disease and the number of subsequent episodes. In particular, the effectiveness of attention processes, executive functions and memory is weakened. These deficits have a negative impact on the patients’ day-to-day functioning at school, in the workplace and in society, and severely impair it.

Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation.

      "abstract": "Empirical studies have recently demonstrated that major and minor depressive disorders occur in 30–50% of stroke patients, and last more than one year without treatment, although they do respond to tricyclic antidepressants. These mood disorders are not strongly associated with severity of impairment, demographic characteristics, social supports or prior personal history, but major depression is often strongly associated with left frontal or left basal ganglia lesions and pre-existing subcortical atrophy. While the aetiology of these mood disorders remains unknown, serotonergic or noradrenergic dysfunction may play a role. Mania is a rare complication of stroke: the clinical presentation and response to treatment are usually the same as mania without brain injury. Post-stroke mania is strongly associated with both a right hemisphere lesion in a limbic-connected area and a second predisposing factor, such as genetic loading for affective disorder, pre-existing subcortical atrophy or seizure disorder. This disorder may be mediated through frontal lobe dysfunction. The lesion method represents a potentially fruitful technique for investigating the mechanisms of affective disorder.",

Evaluating functional overlay and differentiating between this concept and organic conditions is important in medicolegal areas in which financial values are placed on pain and disability.

In considering psychologic reactions to pain and disability, a gradient of simulation, malingering, symptom exaggeration, overvaluation, functional overlay and hysteria is useful. The dynamics of overlay are a combination of anxiety from body-image distortion and depression from decreased efficiency of the body, as well as the resulting psychosocial disruption in a patient's life.",

Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil. La prise en charge doit mettre le deuil au centre de la réflexion : – en traitant l’individu, en appréciant : ∘ la spécificité de son deuil : pré-deuil, deuil « blanc », deuil « non élaboré », deuil de l’enfant, de l’adolescent, de l’adulte, de la personne âgée voire très âgée, les circonstances de la mort du proche : mort d’un enfant, mort par suicide, par homicide, par accident survenant pendant un transport (voiture, train, bateau, etc.) après une catastrophe naturelle, si la mort est brutale et que la personne y a assisté ou si elle a failli elle-même mourir ; – en traitant le groupe : ∘ familial avec une approche transgénérationnelle, ∘ d’individus bénéficiant d’une prise en charge groupale : avec un même type d’endeuillés ou avec des endeuillés de causes différentes.",

Often they seem to peter out or, at least, the family becomes able to cope with the symptom at a domestic level, once the doctor has guessed or established the family’s specific fear, and has been able to reassure them that the pains are not, for example, appendicitis, leukaemia or a brain tumour. Other family members may have dysmenorrhoea, indigestion, or migraine. The abdomen and head and limbs seem to be the most common sites for recurrent pains in children; chest pains or chronic backache are rarer. Although, in most patients, there is no physical cause to account for the pain, careful assessment is necessary. Chronic backache, unlike the others, is more usually a symptom of some underlying organic pathology in a child. It, and limb pains are discussed in Chapter 21.",

Circumstances, personality and psychiatric illness may amplify (and less commonly mute) volunteered pain scores. Most pain is organically initiated and then psychologically contaminated. The psychological and psychiatric factors influencing pain scores will be considered. Patients with a propensity to somatise may elaborate and/or maintain ‘organic’ pain. This occurs ‘unconsciously’ (without awareness). This process deceives the patient (and often also the doctor). Intentional amplification of pain and the construction of pain behaviours for care‐eliciting purpose (factitious disorder) or personal gain (malingering) deceives others. Though there are clinical clues to feigned pains able to be obtained from the history and signs such as those proposed by Waddell, it is notoriously difficult to differentiate partial malingering, conversion or somatoform pain and the pain signature of the particular patient. If the intent of symptom formation and its continuance is psychological, medicine has a diagnostic role. If the intent is for personal greed or is criminal, the diagnosis rests upon legal issues.",

      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Increased health-care costs, prolonged hospital stays, and long-term cognitive decline are well-recognized outcomes of delirium. Delirium can interfere dramatically with the recognition and control of other physical and psychological symptoms such as pain in later stages of illness. Delirium is one of the most common mental disorders encountered in general hospital practice. Delirium is highly prevalent in cancer and AIDS patients with advanced disease, particularly in the terminally ill patients in the last weeks of life, with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 88%. Many of the clinical features and symptoms of delirium can also be associated with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, mania, psychosis, and dementia.",

      "title": "Delirium in Elderly People: A Review",
      "abstract": "The present review aims to highlight this intricate syndrome, regarding diagnosis, pathophysiology, etiology, prevention and management in elderly people. The diagnosis of delirium is based on clinical observations, cognitive assessment, detailed family history, physical and neurological examination. Clinically, delirium occurs in hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed forms, based on psychomotor behaviour. As an acute confusional state, it is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms, fluctuating course and an altered level of consciousness, global disturbance of cognition or perceptual abnormalities and evidence of a physical cause. In spite of pathophysiological mechanisms of delirium remaining unclear, current evidence suggests that disruption of neurotransmission, inflammation or acute stress responses might all contribute to the development of this ailment. It usually occurs as a result of a complex interaction of multiple risk factors, such as cognitive impairment/dementia, current hip fracture and presence of severe illness. Despite all of the above, delirium is frequently under-recognized and often misdiagnosed by health professionals. In particular, this happens due to its fluctuating nature, its overlap with dementia and the scarcity of routine formal cognitive assessment in general hospitals. It is also associated with multiple adverse outcomes that have been well documented, such as increased hospital stay, function/cognitive decline, institutionalization and mortality. In this context, early identification of delirium will be essential. Timely and optimal management of people with delirium, should be performed with identification of possible underlying causes, dealing with a suitable care environment and improving education of health professionals. All these can be important factors, which contribute to a decrease in adverse outcomes associated with delirium.",

Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is the most popular, widely discussed, and recognized of the DDs. Pathological possession has been included as a symptom of DID in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).

      "abstract": "This chapter provides information on definition, etiology/pathophysiology, medical history, clinical features, differential diagnosis, and therapeutics of behavioral or self-injurious dermatoses in small animals. Self-injurious behavior or compulsion refers to any voluntary action resulting in self-damage. Compulsive disorders are characterized by repetitive, persistent, or sustained behaviors in excess of what is required for normal function, especially if severe enough to interfere with normal function. Cutaneous compulsions (psychodermatoses) often have an underlying organic disease or trigger. Diagnosis and treatment include identifying the underlying trigger, treating secondary dermatoses, and modifying behavior to prevent recurrence; medications are a helpful adjunct if anxiety interferes with normal activities or learning. Dermatoses may be initiated by a pathology, with subsequent self-injury causing persistence or worsening of lesions. Basic work-up to rule out medical causes of self-injurious behavior include evaluation for pain or pruritus, including musculoskeletal disease, neurologic disease, and/or primary dermatologic disease.",

      "title": "Depression: epidemic or pseudo-epidemic?",
      "abstract": "There are a number of under-examined fault lines running through the medical literature on depression, and current clinical practice in the UK. This chiefly stems from a too exclusively biomedical focus, neglecting the social construction of the human mind. For a start, the term `depression' tends to be used without qualification, as if it was settled that we were always referring to a free-standing biologically-based disorder. Yet in everyday usage, as much by doctors as by the general public, `depression' can mean something figurative or literal, can denote a normal or abnormal state, and if abnormal either an individual symptom or a full-blown disorder. And though depression-as-disease may have acquired the status of a natural science category, this was an achievement rather than a discovery: the history of the concept demonstrates the gradual incorporation of a Western cultural vocabulary of guilt, energy, fatigue and stress.1\r\n\r\nOrthodox teaching has been that a `functional shift', the presence of so-called biological features, points to medically significant depression (and responsiveness to anti-depressants). But, bar a small subset of severe cases, there is no reliable demarcation of depression from ordinary unhappiness or misery on this basis. Poor sleep and concentration, weight loss, reduced motivation and drive, anhedonia, etc. (as well as suicidal ideas), not uncommonly accompany ordinary misery as well.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, just before the Royal Colleges of Psychiatrists and General Practitioners began a Defeat Depression campaign, they surveyed lay people's attitudes to depression and its treatment.2 The views they elicited tended to portray depression in terms of emotional problems, like unhappiness, caused primarily by social and situational factors, and not something to take to general practitioners (GPs). Of the 2003 people polled, 78% saw anti-depressants as addictive, and liable to dull symptoms rather than solve the problem. The Royal Colleges seem to have been undeterred by these findings, which were rather at odds with their view of `depression' as straightforwardly connoting a psychiatric disorder. Indeed the Royal Colleges initiated the Defeat Depression campaign because they believed that 50% of people with depression did not consult their GPs. They wanted to increase this figure. But was the lay view wrong? We can see here how professional pronouncements can contribute to a blurring between unpleasant but commonplace mental states, part of life, and those associated with objective dysfunction and breakdown, meriting medical attention.\r\n\r\nThe other explicitly stated reason for the campaign was the belief that GPs often missed depression anyway. Since then the notion that there were large numbers of undiagnosed cases has been remarkably tenacious. Why? There is, in fact, no sound evidence for an epidemic of depression (as psychiatric disorder) in the UK. On the other hand, the case for an epidemic of antidepressant prescribing is now cast iron. In Britain prescriptions rose from 9 million to 21 million during the 1990s, and in the USA have doubled in only 5 years—mirroring the production and marketing of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) antidepressants.\r\n\r\nWhat remains striking is how unrobust the evidence base for antidepressants still is, particularly for the mild/moderate cases that account for the majority of all prescriptions.3 Part of the reason is surely that antidepressants will not cure human misery, whether presenting in primary care or in psychiatric clinics. Indeed many of those difficult cases described in psychiatric journals as having `treatment resistant depression' may be `resistant' precisely for this reason.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this repeatedly aired assumption about under-recognition at primary care level has itself led GPs to prescribe more readily. Further, some GPs prescribe for low mood per se, even if other features of the syndrome are absent, and the simpler dose regimens of SSRIs by comparison with tricyclics have helped. Patient feedback is influenced by placebo effects, and by factors like nonspecific sedation that have nothing to do with `antidepression'. People whose record indicates prior prescription of anti-depressants are more likely to be prescribed them again at a later time by other doctors. It remains to be seen if NICE guidelines—which do not recommend antidepressants as the primary intervention in `mild/moderate' cases, make a difference to these trends.4\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical promotion of SSRIs made much of the claim to have fewer side-effects than the tricyclics, and this contributed to the confidence with which GPs recommended them to patients. In view of the public concern about addictive effects evident in the survey described above, it is ironic that discontinuation reactions are now emerging as a distinct clinical problem (extending to litigation against doctors in the USA), both in SSRIs and in other new anti-depressants like venlafaxine.\r\n\r\nThe weak construct validity of psychiatric categories, and the dominance of empiricism over theoretical development, are overarching issues for the psychiatric profession.5 Both are apparent in the discourse about depression. So, too, is a lack of explicit reflection on the ideological and societally-framed nature of medical practice, which would need to take account of cultural shifts in attitudes to adversity and the emergence of an expressive, less stoical individualism.6 The surge in anti-depressant prescribing is as much a cultural trend as a medical one, reflecting the rise of a medicalization and professionalization of everyday life and its problems across Western societies.7\r\n\r\nThere is also an important international dimension. `Depression' is said to contribute 12% of the total burden of nonfatal global disease.8 The World Health Organization describes it as an epidemic that within two decades will be second only to cardiovascular disease in terms of global disease burden. But `depression' has no exact equivalent in non-Western cultures, not least because these do not share a Western ethnopsychology that defines `emotion' as internal, often biological, unintentioned, distinct from cognition, and a feature of individuals rather than situations.9 Non-Western peoples would tend to see the problem in situational and moral terms (as some Western citizens still do, as evidenced by the survey described above), though when they migrate to the West they become more likely to ascribe to a depression-as-disease model.10 This is to highlight the work of culture and its opinion formers—including the medical profession—in shaping a particular interpretation of the world.\r\n\r\nThus the use of Western-derived quantitative instruments to estimate population prevalences worldwide is likely to commit a category fallacy, which is the assumption that mental and bodily state phenomena mean the same thing in whatever setting they are detected. There is no such thing as depression, if by this we mean (as the WHO appear to mean) a unitary, universally valid, pathological entity requiring medical intervention. Such claims seem a serious distortion, one serving to deflect attention away from what millions of people might cite as the basis of their misery, like poverty and lack of rights. The one clear-cut beneficiary would be the pharmaceutical industry, with its vested interest in the biologization of the human predicament.",

      "abstract": "Vertigo, dizziness, and disequilibrium are common symptoms following concussion or traumatic brain injury. Dizziness and vertigo may be the result of trauma to the peripheral vestibular system or the central nervous system, or, in some cases, may be due to anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder; these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. While most peripheral vestibular disorders can be identified by testing and examination, those without inner ear causes that have persisting complaints of dizziness and motion sickness are more difficult to understand and to manage. Some of these patients exhibit features compatible with vestibular migraine and may be treated successfully with migraine preventative medications. This paper reviews the neurological causes of persisting dizziness, the possible mechanisms, and the pathophysiology, as a framework for patient management and for future research.

      "abstract": "In the Freudian division between inhibition, symptom, and anxiety, panic is certainly more on the side of anxiety, that is, of a real that presents itself without symbolic connotations that make it placeable. It is important to see that the panic attack is a clinical phenomenon, but it is not a diagnostic category. Today, the panic attack remains one of major reasons to turn to a psychoanalyst or psychotherapist, together with a large increase in demands for relational problems: people in difficulty in their relationship as a couple or with children, or with difficulties resulting from the absence of relationships, for a loneliness not chosen and barely tolerated. Paradoxically, if in neurosis it is usually a question of deconstructing the suffering side of the symptom by dismantling it, without suppressing it, in panic it is a question of re-establishing the function of embankment that the symptom is not playing. Panic is therefore, in a way, the effect of a revelation.",

      "title": "Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness",
      "abstract": "Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a common cause of dizziness and vertigo. This term was first described fairly recently by the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders in 2017. The symptoms include unsteadiness, vertigo or dizziness, lasting at least 15 days per month for 3 months or longer. The symptoms are exacerbated by upright posture, standing, walking or in the presence of various visual stimuli. The cause of this disorder is still unknown, although it is believed that it is related with the discoordination of the peripheral sensory and the central nervous systems. The onset of dizziness has been explained as the result of failure of integrating visual, vestibular and proprioreceptive signals into the central nervous system. The symptoms are often succeeding a previous vestibular disorder, e.g. vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière’s disease or other disorders. Psychological factors also play a part in the onset of PPPD – patients quite frequently present a history of anxiety, neurotic tendencies and depression. PPPD diagnosis is clinical, a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination are crucial. In order to diagnose PPPD correctly, a set of all five criteria, established by the Bárány society, should be met. The treatment is usually multimodal, consisting of vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive behaviour therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).This review describes the term of PPPD, the symptoms of the disease, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, comorbidities, also the diagnostic criteria and treatment of PPPD. The purpose of this article is to educate about this disease and to encourage more research, as well to seek better care for patients, accomplished by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.",

Sometimes these patients are referred from other specialties such as urology or gynecology; most often, we attempt to search for STIs or other dermatoses on the genitalia and refer them back. We often underestimate the prevalence of sexual concerns of the patients or feel uncomfortable discussing matters of sexuality with them.

Demographic factors, especially those revealing changing social status, recent loss, intentionality, lethality, past history, and high-risk groups, can be rapidly assessed. Viewing suicide as a final common pathway of system dysfunction at any or all major levels-biologic, psychologic, sociocultural-leads to an appreciation of the ubiquitous nature of passive or active \"self murder\" impulses. Persons depressed for any significant length of time for whatever reasons are potentially suicidal. Thus, the \"typical\" depression is suicidal but so are persons whose depression is related to drug side effects, primary illness effects, to living in a dysfunctional family system, or to normal grief. Diagnosis requires inquiry about the depth of the patient's depression pain. Treatment takes into account the aforementioned risk factors, plus interventions appropriate to the malfunctioning system.",

      "title": "What Acute Stress Protocols Can Tell Us About PTSD and Stress-Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the fifth most prevalent mental disorder in the US, is a chronic, debilitating mental illness with as yet limited options for treatment. Hallmark symptoms of PTSD include intrusive memory of trauma, avoidance of reminders of the event, hyperarousal and hypervigilance, emotional numbing and anhedonia. PTSD is often triggered by exposure to a single traumatic experience, such as a traffic accident, a natural catastrophe, or an episode of violence. This suggests that stressful events have a primary role in the pathogenesis of the disorder, although genetic background and previous life events are likely involved. However, pathophysiology of this mental disorder, as for major depression and anxiety disorders, is still poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown how can a single traumatic, stressful event induce a disease that can last for years or decades. A major shift in the conceptual framework investigating neuropsychiatric disorders has occurred in recent years, from a monoamine-oriented hypothesis (which dominated pharmacological research for over half a century) to a neuroplasticity hypothesis, which posits that structural and functional changes in brain circuitry (largely in the glutamate system) mediate psychopathology and also therapeutic action. Rodent stress models are very useful to understand pathophysiology of PTSD. Recent studies with acute or subacute stress models have shown that exposure to short-time stressors (from several minutes to a few hours) can induce not only rapid, but also sustained changes in synaptic function (glutamate release, synaptic transmission/plasticity), neuroarchitecture (dendritic morphology, synaptic spines) and behavior (cognitive functions). Some of these changes, e.g., stress-induced increased glutamate release and dendrite retraction, are likely connected and occur more rapidly than previously thought. We propose here to use a modified version of a simple and validated protocol of footshock stress to explore different trajectories in the individual response to acute stress. This new conceptual framework may enable us to identify determinants of resilient versus vulnerable response as well as new targets for treatment, in particular for rapid-acting antidepressants. It will be interesting to investigate the putative prophylactic action of ketamine towards the maladaptive effects of acute stress in this new protocol.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Infertility is a reproductive system condition defined by the failure to carry a clinical pregnancy following a period of 12 months or more of unprotected regular intercourse. Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

The connection between depression and alterations in gonadal function may have further psychophysiological implications.

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

The nature of hallucinations is often difficult to understand in patients of Turkish (or Moroccan) origin, as they can be diagnosed as a psychotic feature, or as a sign of dissociation, reexperiences, mourning, personality disorder or depression. Most of the time the symptoms can be regarded as culture-bound phenomena of psychosocial stress, often accompanied by somatoform complaints. In those cases they should be diagnosed as pseudohallucinations. Drug interventions only play a supportive role in the treatment of these symptoms.

There are accounts of depressive illness throughout history from almost every human society. The universality of depressive illness is also reflected in the frequency of depression as a theme of the world's great literature.

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Following Intraoperative Awareness",
      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

      "title": "The social dangerousness and medico-legal risks of schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Psychic activity relies on the physiological processes occurring in the brain. When disruptive factors, such as alcohol consumption or hallucinogenic substances intervene, the product of nervous activity, known as the psyche, becomes disturbed, resulting in perception, thought, and behavioral disorders. The psyche can be considered a fascinating mechanism oscillating between extremes: it can be both objective and subjective; both material and ideal. Additionally, the psyche manifests itself both normally and pathologically. Regarding the ways the psyche manifests, distinct categories can be identified. Appropriate behavior exhibited by individuals defines the normal psyche, while the pathological psyche exhibits unusual behavioral disorders often deemed immoral. The term \"normality\" is ambiguous and encompasses several meanings:It can refer to a person's discernment in psychiatric expert evaluations for judicial purposes; It can be associated broadly with individual health; It represents physical, mental, and social well-being; Psychiatrically, it is defined by the absence of mental illness. Medico-legal psychiatric examinations play a crucial role in justice, providing data to assess the responsibility of individuals who have committed criminal acts. To promote ethical principles and lawful conduct, preventive and intervention measures must be devised for cases involving antisocial defiance and social maladaptation. The pathological psyche is characterized by biological and/or psycho-behavioral changes that cause distress, disability, or a high risk of such outcomes (according to the American Psychiatric Association, 1994).",

      "title": "Psychological Morbidity Associated with Orthopedic Trauma",
      "abstract": "Little is known about the clinical consequences of psychological morbidity associated with orthopedic trauma. Previous work has reported that mental illness is an independent predictor of poor outcome following orthopedic trauma, and future studies should explore whether management of psychological symptoms independently predicts recovery from orthopedic trauma. Anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and personality disorders may all flare up during the post-operative period, leading to psychiatric consultation. Other common general post-operative issues include complications related to alcohol abuse, dependence, and withdrawal; pain management in opioid-dependent patients; the presence of personality disorders and other causes of lack of cooperation; and post-operative delirium. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is also common after surgery, particularly after traumatic injuries, but is underrecognized and undertreated. Previous research has evaluated these and other issues in surgical patients. Although psychiatric problems are seen less frequently than previously, the orthopaedic surgeon must remain aware of their possible effect. The prevalence of psychological illness following traumatic injuries varies according to the diagnostic criteria used in studies, the timing of the assessment and definitions of trauma. Estimates of psychological symptoms following musculoskeletal trauma have ranged from 6.5% to 51.0%. Mason assessed the psychological state of 210 male accident and emergency department patients and followed them for 18 months, at which time 30% satisfied criteria for a psychiatric disorder. A recent study of patients with severe lower limb injuries found a 42% prevalence of psychological disorder at 24-month follow-up and that only 22% of such patients reported receiving mental health services. No relation was found between injury severity and psychological distress; however, the authors suggested that low variability in injury severity might have obscured this result. McCarthy further identified a high correlation between the Brief Symptom Inventory (a measure of psychological distress) and the Sickness Impact Profile (a measure of patient function). A high index of suspicion for the presence of psychiatric disorders is important in treating the orthopaedic patient with multiple trauma, chronic disease, factitious disorder, or suspected malingering or who fails to improve with recognized treatment. Recognition of a psychiatric problem should be part of preoperative planning in orthopaedic practice, and a formal psychiatric referral for diagnosis and treatment should be made for the patient with significant psychiatric involvement. When associated psychiatric disease is diagnosed and controlled before orthopaedic treatment commences, the patient is more likely to comply with the treatment regimen, which may lead to better results. It is important for providers who care for patients with minor injury to include a psychiatric history and/or rapid screening for psychiatric disorders as part of the health assessment. Psychosocial factors, specifically, ongoing litigation and psychological symptoms are related with reduced health-related quality of life. Further, the goal of care is to help patients attain maximal functional recovery. Therefore, the presence of a positive psychiatric history or a current psychiatric disorder should stimulate a referral of these patients for appropriate emotional support and therapeutic follow-up. By doing so, providers will give patients important interventions to maximize full recovery.",

Dizziness is a common symptom of FSS. Generally, clinical examination in these cases is inconclusive. The complaints of these patients usually persist until a satisfactory treatment is administered. For the treatment of cases with FSS, first, signs of underlying psychological distress should be identified during history taking. It is essential to address the psychosocial aspect in these cases from a medical point of view. Drug therapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors is therefore prescribed. Next, psychotherapy should be introduced. The final strategy usually is to collaborate with a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist.",

The diagnosis is relatively easy in the classical forms, with a meticulous interview when the context and the patient's complaints are in favour of this condition, but there are various cases in which the symptoms are not typical or in which other diagnoses are in the forefront. In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

      "title": "A Case of Musical Hallucinations in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Aims: New onset psychosis in the elderly is rare with lifetime prevalence rates of 0.3–1%. Schizophrenia occurs in 0.1–0.5% of the elderly, however more common causes of new onset psychosis include dementia, delirium, drug-induced psychosis, and primary psychiatric disorders, most commonly depression. More than 50% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease experience psychotic symptoms and 70% develop delusions, in particular, persecutory type. Visual hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination occurring in 80% of patients with Lewy Body dementia. Second person auditory hallucinations occur in schizophrenia-like psychosis, however musical hallucinations where one perceives music without an external source are rare. Methods: An 84-year-old female patient with no psychiatric background reported a 2-month history of musical hallucinations, causing distress and poor sleep. Patient denied hearing voices and other modalities of hallucinations. The musical hallucinations were not lateralised to either ear or side of space but experienced as external. Delirium was ruled out and patient’s medications were screened for anticholinergics and sedative-hypnotics. Patient had good cognition and a CT head excluded organic causes. The patient appeared distracted by the musical hallucinations, however, was not agitated and her mood was euthymic with congruent affect. No evidence of mood disorders ruled out psychotic depression and other affective disorders with psychotic symptoms. No thought disorders or delusions were present. Antipsychotics quetiapine and amisulpride proved no benefit for the patient. Results: The patient’s presentation showed no clear reversible pathology and was unresponsive to antipsychotics. Musical hallucinations was given as a diagnosis of exclusion. A musical hallucination is a type of auditory hallucination involving the perception of music without an external source. Patients are usually female, over 60 and subdivided into those with hyperacusis, psychiatric disorders, focal brain lesions, epilepsy and intoxication. Our patient was female and over 60 with presbycusis. Musical hallucinations are proposed to be due to abnormal autonomous activity in the auditory brain systems responsible for normal music imagery. Sensory auditory deprivation or acquired peripheral deafness leads to impoverished auditory input and spontaneous activity occurs within the network for the perception and imagery of music. Conclusion: This case report describes a rare phenomenon of musical hallucinations in an elderly patient. It identifies important diagnoses to exclude including delirium, dementia and other organic causes. The patient was female, over 60 yrs and diagnosed with presbycusis, characteristic of patients with musical hallucinations. The patient showed no improvement with antipsychotics and so treatment consisted of psychoeducation.",

The third consideration is the one that is least established, but nevertheless the most discussed recently.

Pseudodementia is a term used clinically to describe symptoms that resemble dementia but are caused by other conditions (most frequently depression), rather than being recognised as an official diagnosis. Pseudodementia is characterised by a cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but which does not have its origin in neurological degeneration, deriving instead from functional psychiatric conditions. This condition is more commonly observed in older adults (particularly those over the age of 50 or 60 years), and its risk factors overlap with those for depression. Pseudodementia is essentially characterised by deficits in memory, executive function and speech and, therefore, can easily be confused with dementia, although there are aspects that allow its differentiation. Diagnosing pseudodementia can be difficult, especially as there is significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions. However, it is important to recognise characteristic aspects of this disorder, as its correct identification is essential for proper treatment.",

That there is a centre in the brain, disorder of which causes a distaste for food, has been suggested, but is scarcely worthy of serious consideration. The cause is more likely to be some local affection, such as malignant disease, gastric ulcer, or simple gastritis, giving rise to pain on the ingestion of food; the refusal of food is then the translation of a protest from a stomach in an unfit state to receive any but the lightest food.",

      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain, Psychopathology, and DSM-5 Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor:\r\n\r\nThe neurophysiological mechanisms and comorbidities of anxiety and depression with chronic pain cited by the authors1 serve as evidence of correlation, not causality. When A (neurophysiological mechanism) and B (symptom of chronic pain) occur together, it cannot be concluded that A causes B, because it could just as well be that B causes A, or a third factor causes both. Regarding the comorbidity of chronic pain with anxiety or depression, it could be that these forms of psychological distress result from chronic pain due to physical impairment, that the pain is a symptomatic expression of anxiety or depression, or that underlying psychosocial issues are causing both. A mentor of mine used to say, “You can’t have a bad thought without a bad molecule, and you don’t know which comes first,” and this paper proves that adage.\r\n\r\nWhen a symptom or condition is diagnosed as psychosomatic, this should not be done solely by exclusion, that is, lack of objective medical evidence. There should be positive substantiation through identification of psychological factors that provide an understanding of what is going on in the life of the patient. The ability to at least ballpark such situations should be in the therapeutic armamentarium of every physician, while psychiatrists should be able to provide biopsychosocial formulations as a core skill. By doing so, we help our patients by empowering them to deal with real life problems, as opposed to placing them in a position of passivity as recipients of a medical solution. Problems occur when psychosomatic diagnoses are communicated poorly, such as “There’s nothing really wrong with you” or “It’s all in your head,” and when patients are not ready to assume psychological ownership of personal problems. Either of these can result in demonization of physicians who make such diagnoses, in the former case justifiably, not so the latter.\r\n\r\nCase in point: the diagnosis of tension headaches seems to have disappeared from the medical lexicon, because everyone has migraines. Despite their potential severity, tension headaches are not seen as medical enough, place an onus on patients to deal with whatever source of tension is causing the headaches, and places physicians who make this diagnosis at risk of demonization for allegedly blaming patients and minimizing their suffering. By contrast, the diagnosis of migraine is perceived as more validating and more supportive, leading to a proliferation of migraine diagnoses and treatments.\r\n\r\nJust as the failure to make a medical diagnosis can have serious consequences in patients with chronic pain and other medically unexplained symptoms, so, too, can the neglect of a psychosomatic diagnosis, in terms of extensive and fruitless investigations and consultations, iatrogenic complications of questionable treatments, and reinforcement of illness–disabled role issues at the expense of dealing with real problems. The mind is more than the sum of the neurochemical parts of the brain, and the failure to recognize this places us at risk of falling into a mindless brand of psychiatry.2",

Clinical evaluation begins with a careful review of medical records. After taking a thorough history, the physician performs the physical examination, including neurological testing, on the patient. The clinical evaluation also determines data needed for impairment evaluation. Neurological examination helps distinguish among the various types of pathology suggested by the history, but to some extent the neurological examination lacks sensitivity and specificity and only about two-thirds (69%) of patients with documented L4-L5 or L5-S1 disc herniations demonstrated weakness or deep tendon reflex changes. To maximize information from the evaluation, physicians routinely test for nonorganic physical signs. Isolated positive signs have no clinical or predictive value, and only a score of three or more positive signs is considered clinically significant. Further, these tests were not designed to detect malingering. Used in isolation, the history, neurological examination, and various diagnostic studies do not have the necessary sensitivity and specificity to diagnose and identify the structural pathology responsible for lumbar radiculopathy. Integrating these components into a logical, unbiased evaluation, physicians usually can perform an accurate assessment.",

      "title": "Neuropsychological triggering factors in musicians with focal dystonia",
      "abstract": "Focal dystonia is a\n neurological movement disorder which affects the fine motor control of a\n specific body location. In professional musicians, a limb or the embouchure\n involved in playing a musical instrument may be impacted. Focal dystonia in\n musicians (FDM) is characterised by a loss of\n voluntary motor control and can be a career-ending condition. The\n pathophysiology of focal dystonia, which remains incompletely understood, is\n mainly associated with dysfunction of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits, with impaired\n inhibition and dysfunctions of sensorimotor pathways. FDM is triggered by various\n neuropsychological and environmental factors. However the existence of\n psycho-psychiatric comorbidities and their possible impact on and/or\n contribution to the manifestation of FDM remains under-investigated. Recent\n studies have revealed that motor function can be altered as a result of\n psychological or psychiatric conditions, suggesting common neurobiological\n networks. Studies conducted in other forms of focal dystonia have uncovered\n psychiatric or other psychological comorbidities such as obsessions, phobias,\n anxieties and depression, whereas a limited number of investigations with FDM\n patients have mainly indicated elevated levels of anxiety and perfectionism.\n The aim of the current thesis was to provide new insights into the\n psychopathology of focal dystonia and its possible consequences for motor\n performance in affected musicians. The investigation was divided into three\n different studies (chapters), each exploring a different aspect of the\n overall topic.\n The first chapter comprises\n a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the psychological profile of FDM\n patients based on standardised psycho-diagnostic\n instruments. Findings indicate that in comparison to healthy controls, half\n of the FDM patients exhibited elevated instances of psychological traits\n related to anxiety, perfectionism and dysfunctional stress-coping features.\n Furthermore, results suggest that these conditions pre-dated the onset of the\n disease and may have contributed as aggravating risk factors to the\n development of FDM. We suggest that the existence of FDM patients with and\n without psychopathology could reflect different mal-adaptive processes\n mediated via different circuits of the cortico-basal\n ganglia-thalamic loops.\n Most of the features in the\n FDM patients diagnosed with psychopathology were related to elevated levels\n of stress and anxiety. Therefore the second chapter focuses on the design of\n a complex experimental paradigm which examines physiological parameters\n (electro-myography [EMG] and fine motor\n performance) in relaxed and stressful conditions, in combination with\n objective assessments (electrocardiography [ECG], cortisol) of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\n (HPA) axis. Due to the fact that no similar paradigm has previously been\n implemented for patients with focal dystonia, a pilot study with a small\n number of patients was conducted. Findings suggest that the experimental\n design is feasible and serves its purpose.\n The final chapter\n encompasses a combined design derived from the first two chapters. Possible\n electrophysiological differences were examined i)\n between FDM patients and healthy controls, ii) among FDM patients before and\n after stress and iii) between\n patients with and without psychopathology. Findings indicate that FDM\n patients are characterised by increased sensitivity to psychosocial\n stressors, in comparison to healthy controls. The impact of stress is\n expressed as an increase in muscular co-contraction of the affected hand, which can be\n explained as a “natural” physiological response under stressful conditions. Finally,\n no motor outcome differences are found between patients with and without\n psychopathology, however results indicate that musicians with psychopathology\n had, on average, developed dystonia around a decade earlier than the\n remainder of the patients, emphasising the contribution of psycho-psychiatric\n conditions to the manifestation of dystonia. Summarising, the current\n thesis suggests the existence of psychopathology in about 50% of musicians\n with focal dystonia. FDM patients with and without psychopathology did not\n differ in their motor performance, however there is clear evidence that\n psychopathology can be an aggravating factor, which may accelerate or even\n trigger the manifestation of dystonia. The current thesis supports the\n concept that motor and psycho-psychiatric features share common\n neurobiological networks in patients with focal dystonia.",

Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

Mostly, that are not explained by an specifiable organic disease and that especially related to psychiatric underlying cause. Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep paralysis is one of the many conditions of which visual hallucinations can be a part but has received relatively little attention. It can be associated with other dramatic symptoms of a psychotic nature likely to cause diagnostic uncertainty. Methods and results: These points are illustrated by the case of a young man with a severe bipolar affective disorder who independently developed terrifying visual, auditory and somatic hallucinatory episodes at sleep onset, associated with a sense of evil influence and presence. The episodes were not obviously related to his psychiatric disorder. Past diagnoses included nightmares and night terrors. Review provided no convincing evidence of various other sleep disorders nor physical conditions in which hallucinatory experiences can occur. A diagnosis of predormital isolated sleep paralysis was made and appropriate treatment recommended. Conclusions: Sleep paralysis, common in the general population, can be associated with dramatic auxiliary symptoms suggestive of a psychotic state. Less common forms are either part of the narcolepsy syndrome or (rarely) they are familial in type. Interestingly, sleep paralysis (especially breathing difficulty) features prominently in the folklore of various countries.",

One can then observe co-occurrence and mutual interaction of dysfunctions typical of addiction and of other mental disorders that accompany addiction. That is why, clinical pictures of such states (double diagnosis) are usually less unique, have an unusual course and cause diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty. The problem of forensic psychiatric opinion and treatment of people with a double diagnosis is another aspect of these difficulties. It is caused by the fact that forensic psychiatric assessment of the mental state of such people requires taking into consideration a very complex clinical and legal situation triggered by the interference of various ethiopathogenetic and clinical disorders. It leads to the need for complex evaluation and reference to sanity or other signs of functioning within the current law should result, first of all, from the analyses directly pertaining to the influence of the diagnosed disorders on the state of patients with double diagnosis. The forensic psychiatric aspect of disorders connected with double diagnosis is particularly significant as there is a relatively high risk of behaviours posing a threat to public order in this group of patients.",

      "abstract": "Central poststroke pain (CPSP), formerly known as thalamic pain syndrome of Déjerine and Roussy, is a central neuropathic pain occurring in patients affected by stroke. It is one manifestation of central pain, which is broadly defined as central neuropathic pain caused by lesions or dysfunction in the central nervous system. Thalamic pain was first described 100 years ago by Déjerine and Roussy and has been described as \"among the most spectacular, distressing, and intractable of pain syndromes\". CPSP is characterized by constant or intermittent pain and is associated with sensory abnormalities, particularly of thermal sensation. While the pain is frequently described as burning, scalding, or burning and freezing, other symptoms are usually vague and hard to characterize, making an early diagnosis particularly difficult. In fact, those who develop CPSP may no longer be under the care of health care professionals when their symptoms begin to manifest, resulting in misdiagnosis or a significant delay before treatment begins. Diagnosis is further complicated by cognitive and speech limitations that may occur following stroke, as well as by depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances. Patients may also exhibit spontaneous dysesthesia and the stimulus-evoked sensory disturbances of dysesthesia, allodynia and hyperalgesia. The present study offers a historical reference point for future clinical and basic research into this elusive type of debilitating pain.",

      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

      "title": "Chronic, Unipolar, Treatment-Resistant Mania: A Case Report and Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

      "abstract": "In addition to accidental crisis, we are often talking in the modern world about development crisis. The terms like period, or time, even years of crisis are mostly used in the milieu of our country, because our people were exposed to contemporary or successive critical situations. This increases the general tendency to mental disorders and causes many pathological phenomena, with suicide among them as the most serious. In our society suicide is treated as well as a product of illness or seismograph of sociable impact, because there is high unemployment, privation, high percent of divorce and social isolation. Nevertheless, the same occurs in other developmental states, were benefit of civilization, wrongly directed, can dehumanize and alienate and lead to suicidal tendencies. Although, the risk of suicide is 3-12 times higher among psychiatric patients, the greatest number of those who commit suicide have never met a psychiatrist. Furthermore, when in the presence of mental illness, the patient consciously chooses death, great stigma and mystery remains attached to the psychiatrist himself. Psychiatrists are sometimes placed between, on the one side, some statistical reports or simplified approaches, which very clearly claim to know the causes of and, on the other side, knowledge about the role of the unconscious in in formulation of not why someone committed suicide, butwhat does he wanted to reach? Psychiatric experience is that there will be 5 patient's suicides within a psychiatrist's life span. We are afraid this figure will be exceeded today, in a time of crisis, endangering the psychiatrist himself. The Psychiatrist should not stay alone in his treatment of suicidal patient. He needs a great support of society, just like his patient does. Only by working together, will we feel that we are doing something not with, but for someone who wants to commit suicide.

      "abstract": "Abstract Pain is etymologically combined with penalty, emotionally with anxiety and depression, and physiologically with inflammatory processes and other kinds of pressure augmentation in the tissues. Pain is a subjective experience that cannot be measured or “objectively” verified by other individuals. Reactions to pain, however, can be registered by others. Pain in the orofacial area may have several etiological explanations. Since the functional pattern of the area is multi‐faceted, persisting pain in the area most likely has a multi‐factorial background, and also a variety of effects. Treatment should be made considering delicate diagnostical distinctions. A thorough clinical examination contains lots of treatment components. This paper discusses some psychological factors in the diagnosis and treatment of orofacial pain.",

      "title": "Fibromyalgia or pseudo fibromyalgia? - We have to get it right",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain disorders like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, repetitive strain injury and myofascial pain syndromes are no more considered as ‘waste basket diagnosis’, especially because of better biological understanding of these disorders including their immunological and genetic links.1-3 Patients truly suffering from these illnesses, therefore, need to be recognised correctly. Missing these peculiar illnesses and thereby messing them up by misdiagnosing as more serious ailments like Rheumatoid arthritis, other arthritic conditions, connective tissue diseases, psychiatric illnesses or malingering are expensive errors. An equally expensive error is labelling these close mimics and other pseudo fibromyalgia states as fibromyalgia. In both the scenarios, implications can be clinical (progression of an undiagnosed illness), pharmacological (toxicity of an unwarranted drug therapy) economic, emotional, social or even legal. Unfortunately, these errors are made by General practitioners, Physicians, orthopedicians, Psychiatrists and by Rheumatologists alike.4 Syndromic approach to diagnosis of illnesses relies upon physical signs and investigations to a large extent. In pain disorders like fibromyalgia, however, the vague, ‘out of proportion’ tenderness on minor pressure or even a gentle touch may be the only other notable feature apart from the widespread aches complained by the patient. There is no ‘tell-tale’ sign elicitable by inspection, palpation, percussion or auscultation for this spectrum of illnesses. Laboratory investigations always draw a blank. Chronic pain disorders, therefore, cannot be diagnosed by this conventional approach.5 Although chronic wide spread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and mental fogging are some of the hallmarks of these illnesses, familiarity with classification criteria is a prerequisite to identify a good number of them. There are patients, however, with these illnesses that do not fulfill any criteria. Neurochemical misbalances, rather than anatomical lesions are more likely to cause these disorders; nor are they straightforward psychiatric illnesses, in spite of many reports of mind-body link in these conditions.6, 7 While rheumatology clinics in the western and developed world are flooded with such patients and rheumatologists in those parts of the world are more familiar with these illnesses, developing world is less familiar with these maladies. Now that the epidemic seems to be reaching the less developed world, many unanswered questions need to be addressed on this subject. Is it globalization that is bringing it to the developing world, where people earlier could tolerate small aches and pains better? Is it much less common amongst the underprivileged section of the society? Do lifestyle, dietary factors and other socioeconomic factors have some influence on pain threshold, if not on causation of these new world diseases? Painful disorders with anatomical lesions like inflammatory arthropathies, connective tissue diseases and osteoarthritis may also cause vicious cycle of ‘pain begetting more pain’, which may be termed as secondary fibromyalgia.8 On the contrary and paradoxically enough, there is a paradigm shift in the understanding of pain disorders; it is now believed widely that pain itself can cause localised inflammation in a significant proportion of cases and thereby induces this novel mechanism to perpetuate the vicious cycle of pain.9 Whether this has a therapeutic implication is arguable, but breaking this cycle is important in arresting the pain process. Mimics of fibromyalgia comprise a wide spectrum. On the one end, there are highly treatable low grade metabolic disorders like hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency causing chronic widespread pain. These relatively common disorders need to be excluded or diagnosed and treated, as the case may be, in a chronic pain scenario.10 On the other end of this spectrum, there are more serious organic pathologies like enthesopathic pain of spondyloarthropathies and at times, out of proportion pain and tenderness of leukemic arthropathies, especially in children presenting as vague aches and pains. Attending physician need to be sensitized to avoid misdiagnosing these conditions as fibromyalgia. Last, but not the least, undiagnosed cases of psychiatric illnesses including depression and malin-gering for social, emotional or economic gains can also present as ‘pseudofibromyalgia’.11, 12 The Chinese study in this issue by Rong MU et al. has revealed poor awareness and deficiency in diagnostic skills amongst doctors including rheumatologists and is a must- read article for all. Some of the points discussed in the preceding paragraphs are realised in this paper. Many rheumatologists who considered themselves non-believers of this vague entity in the recent past, have now turned into believers in view of emerging evidences cited above. No rheumatologist can afford to make a mistake today in diagnosing or excluding these modern day illnesses.",

It does not work very well for most mental health problems, as these are based on common sensations and perceptions that most of people experience from time to time. It is apparent that the various symptoms that make up the diagnostic categories of mental disorders are distributed widely and variously across the population. The biomedical model considers that pathophysiological changes are the basis on which to consider and characterize the presence of a pathological process. Disease categories should only be regarded as valid if they can be shown to be discrete entities with natural boundaries that separate them from other disorders. Even more uncertain are the boundaries between anxiety, depression and somatization in primary care. Mental health disorders may be \"valid\" but not useful in clinical practice.",

Mezi nejčastější psychické problémy onkologických nemocných patří strach a úzkost, deprese, patologická únava a posttraumatická stresová porucha. Několik klinických studií prokázalo, že neléčená deprese je spojena s četnějšími somatickými komplikacemi a s horší prognózou základní nemoci než u nemocných se stejnou nemocí, ale bez deprese. K rozvoji deprese napomáhá nenaplnění \"nově vzniklých potřeb nemocných\". Psychické poruchy se mohou objevit i po ukončené léčbě. Starší psychiatři měli pro tuto situaci termín deprese z odbřemenění, dnes se tato situace nazývá posttraumatická stresová porucha. Deprese může indukovat různé bolesti, nejčastěji bolesti břicha, ale málo je známo že deprese může navodit i psychogenní horečku a psychogenní noční pocení. Někdy může být onkologické onemocnění provázeno těžkou depresí s psychotickými rysy, dřívějším termínem involuční melancholie. Problémem je také patologická únava, která v době léčby postihuje téměř všechny nemocné, ale u 30-40 % nemocných může přetrvávat i po ukončení léčby. Fyzické cvičení dle posledních poznatků má příznivý vliv jak na depresi, tak i na patologickou únavu. Z uvedených poznatků vyplývá doporučení pro hematology a onkology - včas tyto psychické komplikace odhalit a včas odeslat tyto nemocné do odpovídající psychologické či psychiatrické léčby.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is commonly defined as a state in which physical activities and sensory perception are greatly reduced, and it is frequently associated with our body's recuperative period. However, research has shown that sleep is also required for other vital processes such as memory consolidation and normal physiological functioning. Extensive research has shown that the areas that control our sleeping behaviour are the hypothalamus, brain stem, midbrain, and amygdala. These areas coordinate events during the non-REM and REM phases of sleep-wake cycles. GABA and adenosine, two chemical neurotransmitters, are also involved and play an important role in our sleep cycle. Insomnia has caused a slew of psychological and physiological issues such as fatigue, decreased mental concentration, irritable nature and a higher risk of heart attacks and stroke. It has reduced the patient's quality of life of the patient and have a social impact on them. Primary insomnia is defined as the inability/absence of proper sleep and impaired daily life functioning. Secondary insomnia, on the other hand, is believed to result from pre-existing medical conditions, substance abuse, or as a side effect of certain drug therapy. Insomnia is diagnosed through physical examination and the use of electrical devices to monitor sleep behavior.",

Such questions are typically prompted after a medical or neurological evaluation has not identified the etiology of the physical symptoms, if the symptoms are incompatible with or disproportionate to existing medical or neurological pathology, or if the patient is engaging in maladaptive health-related or interpersonal behaviors in the hospital. Provider countertransference in response to patients presenting with psychiatric disorders that feature somatic symptoms—as well as the maladaptive behaviors that may accompany these symptoms—can lead to provider distress or impact patient care and is a critical area for liaison interventions from the consulting psychiatrist. This chapter demonstrates the approach to the hospitalized patient whose physical symptoms may arise secondary to psychological processes or whose psychological response to medical symptoms gives rise to pathological distress, behaviors, and impairment. It highlights some of the psychological factors that may contribute to the experience of and response to somatic symptoms, as well as some of the challenging interpersonal dynamics that occur in the hospital setting. Clinical cases involving somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder, and factitious disorder present strategies for making complex diagnoses, therapeutic interventions, and effectively engaging these patients in psychiatric evaluation and treatment.",

The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death.",

This narrative review focuses on the main clinical presentations of cognitive and psychological problems ('mind injuries') that occur postoperatively in absence of ascertainable focal neurologic deficits, exploring their pathophysiological mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention and treatment. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a potentially devastating complication that can involve several mechanisms and several predisposing, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors, which can result in or be associated to cerebral microvascular damage. Postoperative depression is influenced by genetic or psychosocial predisposing factors, by neuroendocrine activation, and by the release of several pro-inflammatory factors. The net effect of these changes is neuroinflammation. These complex biochemical alterations, along with an aspecific response to stressful life events, might target the function of several brain areas, which are thought to represent a trigger factor for the onset of depression.",

Historically these peculiar postures were considered psychogenic but have now been classified as forms of dystonia. Writer's cramp is the most commonly identified task‐specific dystonia and has features typical of this group of disorders. Symptoms may begin with lack of dexterity during performance of a specific motor task with increasingly abnormal posturing of the involved body part as motor activity continues. Initially, the dystonia may manifest only during the performance of the inciting task, but as the condition progresses it may also occur during other activities or even at rest. Neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for the dystonia‐related abnormalities. Although the precise pathophysiology remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests reduced inhibition at different levels of the sensorimotor system. Symptomatic treatment options include oral medications, botulinum toxin injections, neurosurgical procedures, and adaptive strategies. Prognosis may vary depending upon body part involved and specific type of task affected. Further research may reveal new insights into the etiology, pathophysiology, natural history, and improved treatment of these conditions.",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

      "title": "Subjectivity, psychosis and the science of psychiatry",
      "abstract": "The significance for psychiatry of a patient's subjective or \"lived\" experience seems obvious even on casual reflection, especially in cases of severe mental illness. It is likely that curiosity and concern about what a patient is experiencing is a prerequisite for building trust or a therapeutic alliance, particularly when the experiences seem highly unsettling and unusual. Few would deny that grasping something of the patient's viewpoint should play a role both in developing and selecting therapeutic techniques. Beyond this, it seems likely that some understanding of patients' subjective life is relevant to psychopathology as a scientific enterprise. The explanandum at issue in what we term \"delusion\", \"hallucination\" or \"thought disorder\" may, for instance, be found to involve quite different experiences across different individuals, diagnoses or subgroups, and such knowledge can improve the pathogenetic modelling of mental disorders. It is possible, in fact, that the lackluster results of neurobiological research on severe mental illness in recent decades (widely acknowledged) be in part due to neglect of this subjective dimension and the distinctions it would allow. Given all this, it is striking to note how limited the study of patients' experiences has been in the mainstream of psychiatry and clinical psychology. One may wonder why. An obvious reason is the influence of exclusionary and reductive forms of empiricism and materialism, which have stressed the difficulty both of observing subjective life and of incorporating it into the causal order of the universe. Subjectivity can indeed seem what phenomenological philosopher M. Merleau-Ponty termed \"the flaw in the great diamond of the world\"1 – a recalcitrant explanatory outlier, albeit one that is lodged at the center of each one of us (our consciousness) and is the condition for whatever knowledge we possess. A second reason is a widespread discomfort with and incomprehension of the states of mind that characterize severe forms of mental or emotional disorder, especially psychoses. Though many scientists and scholars are fascinated by the limit-experiences that can occur in psychotic conditions, many are ready to accept what are, in scientific terms, extremely vague and potentially misleading characterizations, often involving defect and deficit assumptions that do little more than register the absence of a norm (e.g., \"inappropriate affect\", \"false belief\"). Deficit models are often criticized on ethical grounds as being condescending or even insulting to the patient's dignity, but their modes of objectification may also be scientifically inadequate, since they fail to register what may be qualitatively distinct about the condition being studied2. Conventional approaches also tend to downplay the agentic role of the patient – i.e., the subtle ways in which a patient's orientation or attitude, partly under his/her control, can impact the nature of delusions, hallucinations or \"thought disorder\"3. The study by Fusar-Poli and numerous co-authors publish­ed in this issue of the journal4 is an exceptionally important contribution. There have been previous attempts, especially by phenomenologists and qualitative researchers, to collaborate intensively with patients whose experiences they study, but never on such a broad-based, quantitative scale. As the authors note, their results are in fact consistent with the rich phenomenological tradition which stemmed from K. Jaspers and the Heidelberg school and included, among the others, K. Schneider, K. Conrad, W. Blankenburg, E. Minkowski and the various contemporary experts cited in the paper. Phenomenological psychopathology did influence mainstream British psychiatry in the 1950s through a textbook by the German-Jewish émigré W. Mayer-Gross, and penetrated North American consciousness with the anthology Existence in 19585 and Laing's Divided Self of 1960; but then it languished for several decades prior to its more recent renaissance beginning in the 1990s. Fusar-Poli et al's study vindicates this most venerable approach to a rigorous understanding of mental life in psychiatric illness. The present study is mainly in the tradition of descriptive phenomenology, offering diverse accounts largely in the vocabulary of everyday language, eschewing attempts at explanatory synthesis5. Another type of phenomenology, more speculative and theoretical, does try to account for the heterogeneity of some subsets of symptoms by identifying a core or generating disorder, thereby providing models for pathogenetic research that can account for the variety and variability of certain psychotic conditions – e.g., \"loss of vital contact\"6 or altered \"basic-self experience\"7. There is much to be learned from Fusar-Poli et al's report, a su­perb compendium of all the major experiences characteristic of psychosis, and perhaps especially of the contested category of schizophrenia. Like earlier phenomenological work, their research shows that signs and symptoms can seem very different from within a mental condition compared to what common sense or standard psychiatry often claims. Hallucinated voices may not exactly be \"heard\". What we call \"delusions\" may or may not be taken literally and, rather than being \"erroneous beliefs\", may sometimes involve withdrawal into a private or subjective world that the pa­tient himself actually recognizes as such8. So-called \"poverty of con­­tent of speech\" – a type of \"formal thought disorder\" – may somet­imes contain profundities. Among the many insights to be gleaned is the prominence (at least for some patients some of the time) of the experience of insight and illumination. Confronted with \"madness\", the academic observer or man-on-the-street stresses metaphors of darkness, confusion, and subterranean journeys, and this sometimes accords with the patient's viewpoint. But, as Fusar-Poli et al4 report, patients may describe some \"psychotic\" states as shot through with a sense of almost blinding clarity and revelation. We must beware of projecting our own yearnings and value judgments onto the patients. They, at least, can sometimes feel not beneath, but far above the quotidian realities of \"normal\" people, who neglect more encompassing and foundational though ineffable truths – truths perhaps accessible only to forms of self-conscious or hyperreflexive awareness unavailable to most of us3. In closing, one must acknowledge some gaps in our grasp of subjectivity and its significance for psychiatry. It may be obvious to common sense that the exercise of free will, together with a person's experience of meaning or significance, do play a role in human behavior and thereby affect the material plane of brain functioning (if I choose to close my eyes, in prayer, patterns in visual cortex are altered). But it is also true that we have difficulty incorporating the domains of conscious life and its physical substrate within a single explanatory account (the mind/body problem). In particular, we have difficulty integrating \"act\" with \"affliction\" aspects of psychological existence3 – that is, appreciating the subtle but decisive ways in which defensive or other goal-directed forms of thought or behavior can interact with aspects of mental life over which the person has little or no control. Even more basic is the challenge of observing and describing consciousness itself, whose ever-changing, all-encompassing flow we, as human beings and language speakers, are constantly tempted to misperceive or misdescribe. We succumb to this temptation by using words that stress the substantive over the transitory aspects of experience, or by focusing on particular objects of awareness while ignoring subtle alterations in, for example, the experience of space, time, or the overall atmosphere of reality. In fact, no approach can be fully \"bottom-up\" in the sense of being purely empirical or a-theoretical: when it comes to describing experience, patients as well as professionals are burdened (though also blessed) with the objectifying prejudices of their language and their worldview. The study of \"lived experience\" may then be impossible as a foolproof, quasi-empiricist venture. It is, however, also indispensable – and to both the ethical and the scientific enterprise of psychiatry9.",

Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental illnesses together with sleep disorders and astheno-neurotic syndrome [3]. Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term, uncorrected disturbances of circadian rhythms lead to clinically significant distress and cause mental, physical, social, professional, educational, or other functional impairments [6].",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

Diese konnten sich bisher nur auf nicht überprüfte Vermutungen stützen. Inzwischen liegen aus mehreren Instituten unfallmechanische Untersuchungen von naturgetreuen Auffahrunfällen mit Zusammenprall von rückwärts, von vorne und von der Seite vor. Dabei wurden die Bewegungsabläufe mit einer Hochgeschwindigkeitsvideokamera unter gleichzeitiger elektronischer Erfassung anderer, wichtiger Parameter erfasst. Übereinstimmend hat sich gezeigt, dass die gesamte Crashphase etwa 3/10 s dauert und dass ein Schleudermechanismus tatsächlich nicht stattfindet. Das sog. Syndrom der Spätfolgen nach Schleudertrauma ist uncharakteristisch. Eine gleichartige Symptomatik wird bei verschiedenen Befindlichkeitsstörungen beobachtet, deren nosologische Stellung zweifelhaft ist. In vielen Fällen sind die somatischen, emotionalen und kognitiven Beschwerden Ausdruck von Depressivität.

      "abstract": "Post-stroke mood and emotional disturbances are frequent and diverse in their manifestations. Among them, post-stroke depression is the best known. Although post-stroke anger (PSA) has been studied relatively less, it can be as frequent as depression. Manifestations of PSA range from overt aggressive behaviors (including hitting or hurting others) to becoming irritable, impulsive, hostile, and less tolerable to family members. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of PSA include neurochemical dysfunction due to brain injury, frustration associated with neurological deficits or unfavorable environments, and genetic predisposition. PSA causes distress in both patients and their caregivers, negatively influences the patient’s quality of life, and increases the burden on caregivers. It can be treated or prevented using various methods, including pharmacological therapies. In addition, anger or hostility may also be a risk or triggering factor for stroke. The hazardous effects of anger may be mediated by other risk factors, including hypertension or diabetes mellitus. The identification of anger as a result or cause of stroke is important because strategic management of anger may help improve the patient’s quality of life or prevent stroke occurrence. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, prevalence, factors or predictors, relevant lesion locations, and pharmacological treatment of PSA. We further describe the current evidence on anger as a risk or triggering factor for stroke.",

      "title": "Differential diagnosis in mild brain injury: understanding the role of non-organic conditions",
      "abstract": "Over one million mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) occur annually in the United States. Most of these patients recover full function within about 3 months, but a significant minority do not. Failure to recover as expected following a diagnosed or suspected mild TBI is most commonly related to a concurrent diagnosis or alternative diagnosis or condition. Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms. Accurate diagnosis will lead to better treatment and optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on early identification of the 'slow to recover' group to allow early and appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONBruxism is psychopathophysiological disorder of orofacial muscle activity which is defined by American Academy of Orofacial Pain as a diurnal or nocturnal parafunctional activity including clenching, bracing, gnashing, and grinding of the teeth.1 The excessive and frequent nocturnal bruxist activity, unlike physiological muscular activity during sleep, results in non-physiological wear (attrition) of occlusal surfaces.2,3In multifactorial and often controversial bruxism etiology, peripheral (morphological) and central (physchological and pathophysiological) etiological factors can be distinguished.4 The most common morphological factors, such as occlusion (in particular occlusal discrepancies), along with the anatomy of the orofacial system have been considered more traditional than evidence based medicine and dentistry bruxism causative factors.4,5Bruxism is related to great number of pathophysiological factors. During sleep, sudden awakening or change in intensity of sleep may occur. That is arousal response. Then, generalized change of body activity occurs: higher heart rate, changes in breathing rhythm, peripheral vasoconstriction and muscular hyperactivity, including bruxism.6 Changes of the central neurotransmitter system in the nigrostriatal projection can cause the muscular activity disorders. Drug therapy can also induce bruxism: L-dopa, neuroleptics and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Numerous substances such as amphetamines, amphetamine-like substances, nicotine and alcohol can play major role in the etiology of bruxism, which has been particularly explained by effects via dopamine system.7Behavioral disorders and affective psychological factors, anxiety being one of the most prominent together with emotional stress, caused by sociological and psychological factors, can induce bruxism.8Dentistry and alcohol consumingAlcoholism is progressive mental disease with social and health consequences. The addiction to alcohol is more difficult to observe in early stages of alcoholism due to some traditional reasons related to alcohol consuming, which can have adverse side effects in dental treatment. Alcohol consumption leads to great number of systemic disorders, such as malnutrition and hypovitaminosis, neurological disorders, pathological changes in the digestive, cardiovascular and respiratory system.9,10Besides the poor oral hygiene, consumption of alcohol may cause oral diseases, periodontal diseases and premature tooth loss. Alcoholics are exposed to higher risk of orofacial trauma (for example, jaw fractures), fractures and even losing the removable dentures while under the influence of alcohol.11The aim of this paper is to give case report on Michigan splint treatment of very severe bruxism in female patient who was under psychiatric therapy due to alcohol consuming, which caused psychoorganic syndrome.CASE REPORTA previously treated 62 year old psychiatric female patient was referred to the Prosthodontic Department, School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb for prosthodontic treatment. She exhibited pronounced teeth abrasion.Psychiatric treatmentTaking her case history with the assistance of her son and from the available medical records of her previous psychiatric treatments, we found out that she had been an alcoholic for many years (F 10.2 diagnosis by the International Classification of Diseases - ICD) and subsequently developed pyschoorganic syndrome with characteristics of depression (F 10.7 diagnosis by the ICD). Although she has had the alcohol addiction problem for many years, her psychiatric treatment started in 2001. She was hospitalized for three months at the alcoholism ward and discharged in better health condition with recommendation to take 20 mg of fluoxetine in the morning and 3x5 mg of diazepam. In the same year, she was coming regularly for check-up in the Psychiatric patient clinic accompanied by her son who reported her abstinence from alcohol, but also less communication and more passiveness in behavior. …",

Depressive symptoms are a collection of behaviors and feelings that can be specifically classified as depression. Symptoms of depression are at least seen from three aspects, namely physical symptoms, psychic symptoms, and social symptoms. Some people have a negative stigma about individuals affected by mental disorders such as depression, some studies show data on affected individuals exposed to negative stigma, one of which was shown by McLean Hospital in 2020 which showed that 75% of individuals with mental disorders had been stigmatized by society. The stigma given by society related to people who have a mental disorder is very diverse, ranging from so-called insane, people who do not have reason, and so on, but the highlight in this study is the stigma from society against people affected by mental disorders is the stigma that those who experience depression or other mental disorders that they lack faith, lack of prayer, lack of belief in God, and various other stigmas, this is then exacerbated by \"religious figures\" who sometimes give the same stigma and do not provide solutions to what is being felt by people who are affected by mental disorders. The results showed that faith can be a factor that can improve the mental health of an individual.",

Yet the results are mostly clinical in nature, and often refer to unrepresentative groups of patients selected for study because of special medical conditions. The few epidemiological reports are problematic as well because of methodologic problems and inconsistencies that hinder the comparison of results. Most investigations concerning \"head injury\" are really about brain injury. In some reports, however, it is unclear whether the authors intended to study brain injury or head injury. Determining brain injury severity has been a long-standing problem. For decades, various systems were employed, and most were nonreproducible because of their subjective nature. Duration of unconsciousness was one of the most consistently used criteria to judge severity, because it was positively correlated with diffuse brain damage. A spinal cord injury that results in loss of motor or sensory function is one of the most catastrophic medical conditions recognized.",

The data, past illnesses, prodromal symptoms, and psychosocial information were obtained from the plant medical records, the private physicians, and mainly from direct interviews with the surviving next-of-kin, usually the wife. The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death.",

Studier har visat att cirka 6-15% av alla patienter med affektiv sjukdom begar sjalvmord. Vidare har det visat sig att cirka halften av alla manniskor som tar livet av sig har haft en depression. Man har darfor sokt efter riskfaktorer inom depressionsgruppen. Sjalvmordsforsok ar den viktigaste kliniska riskfaktorn for deprimerade likaval som for andra grupper. Man har ocksa funnit skillnader mellan sjalvmordsfall och kontroller betraffande symptom, sociala bakgrundsfaktorer, personlighet och biologiska markorer. Somnloshet, tidig foraldraforlust, att leva ensam och for kvinnor histrionisk personlighet ar exempel pa riskfaktorer, liksom laga halter av ett amne i ryggmargsvatskan (5-HIAA). Sjalvmord foregas ofta av forsok och dessa ar i sin tur foregangna av sjalvmordstankar.

Depressioner ar forenade med okad dodlighet aven i somatiska sjukdomar, och en fragestallning for avhandlingen har varit om denna okade risk kvarstar sent i forloppet och om sjalvmordsrisken forblir densamma. Slutligen uppstar fragan om gangse somatiska behandlingar, antidepressiv medicin och elektrisk behandling, som ar sa effektiva vid depressionsbehandling, ocksa kan forebygga sjalvmord. Ett flertal studier, men inte alla, har visat att deprimerade patienter som tagit livet av sig ofta inte fatt tillracklig behandling. Kontrollerade studier har emellertid inte kunnat pavisa nagon klar skillnad som tyder pa forebyggande effekt av antidepressiv terapi med mediciner eller el-behandling. Kombinationen av elbehandling och uppfoljande antidepressiv medicinering har inte undersokts i tillrackligt stora material for att kunna pavisa nagon skillnad. Denna avhandling behandlar djupa depressioner/melankoli. Den utgar fran de multiaxiala skattningar som gjordes av inneliggande patienter pa psykiatriska klinken under 50- och 60-talen. Under denna tid fick 1206 patienter den namnda diagnosen (506 man och 700 kvinnor). Vid en forsta uppfoljning 1984 hade 103 patienter tagit livet av sig. Av dessa utvaldes de som hade en primar depression, alltsa ingen tidigare diagnos, for undersokning. Darvid ingick 89 patienter i studien (38 man och 51 kvinnor). Lika manga kontroller ur samma material utvaldes matchade for kon, alder och forsta inlaggningsar med diagnosen. En blind genomgang av journalerna gjordes med skattningar av en rad variabler, som sjalvmordsbeteende, behandling m m. I en andra omgang gjordes en uppfoljning av dodligheten hos samma patienter fran 1984-1998. Da hade ytterligare 14 patienter tagit livet av sig (8 man och 3 kvinnor). Avhandlingen har behandlat riskfaktorer, utveckling av sjalvmordsbeteende, sen dodlighet (efter 15 ar och mer) samt behandling vid sjalvmordet. Studie 1 Sprod/sensitiv personlighet och hereditet for psykos var relaterade till sjalvmord i den manliga gruppen. I den kvinnliga gruppen var sjalvmordsoffren oftare ensamstaende, negativa till behandling och hade oftare gjort sjalvmordsforsok. Nagot ovantat hade kontrollerna oftare haft en disharmonisk uppvaxt och hade oftare en fysisk sjukdom. Detta kan tyda pa att de som begick sjalvmord var mera sarbara an de andra. Studie 2 Livsleda, dodsonskan, sjalvmordstankar och planer skilde inte mellan dem som begick sjalvmord och kontroller. Daremot var livsleda relaterat till sjalvmord for man med sprod/sensitiv personlighet och ”tvingande” sjalvmordstankar for man med psykos. Det var vanligare att kvinnor tog livet av sig utan att ha kommunicerat sjalvmordstankar eller gjort sjalvmordsforsok an det var for man. Studie 3 Sjalvmordsforsok predicerade som vantat for sjalvmord. Det galler for man som bara haft depressioner och for kvinnor som aven haft skov av forhojd sinnesstamning. Sjalvmordsforsokens karaktar, som metod, svarighetsgrad och upprepning skilde inte mellan sjalvmord och kontroller och kan darfor inte sagas oka risken. Daremot borjade kvinnor som senare tog livet av sig oftare med ett allvarligt sjalvmordsforsok jamfort med sina kontroller. Stressande livshandelser var ungefar lika vanliga fore det forsta sjalvmordsforsoket hos sjalvmord och kontroller. De senare gjorde emellertid oftare upprepade och svara forsok efter utlosande handelser. Dessutom var handelserna oftare allvarliga i kontrollgruppen. Detta tyder an en gang pa en storre sarbarhet hos dem som senare begar sjalvmord. Dessa gor istallet fler upprepade forsok ju fler depressiva skov de far. Tva sjalvmordsprocesser kan beskrivas i den kvinnliga gruppen: 1. En sjalvmordskarriar som ofta borjar med ett allvarligt sjalvmordsforsok och darfor inte uppvisar nagon okning i svarighetsgrad; upprepade forsok relaterade till depressionsforloppet snarare an yttre handelser. Denna karriar slutar ofta med fullbordat sjalvmord. 2. En karriar som borjar med ett mindre allvarligt sjalvmordsforsok och senare i forloppet uppvisar allvarliga forsok, ofta utlosta av yttre handelser. Denna karriar har ofta god prognos. Den sjalvmordsprocess som beskrivits i litteraturen fanns saledes hos kontrollerna! Detta ar faktiskt inte orimligt eftersom tidigare studier gjorts pa personer som gjort sjalvmordsforsok av vilka de flesta overlever och saledes kan forvantas likna vara kontroller. Studie 4 Dodligheten sent i forloppet var okad i andningsorganens sjukdomar, sjalvmord och osakra sjalvmord for man och okad for alla orsaker sammanlagt och sjalvmord for kvinnor. Sjalvmord ar dock mindre vanligt sent jamfort med tidigare i forloppet. Man begar oftare an kvinnor sjalvmord sent i forloppet. Denna skillnad fanns inte tidigare vid en undersokning av samma material. Den totala dodligheten i sjalvmord ar hittills 10%, alltsa nagot hogre an de 6%som nyligen kalkylerats for depressioner i allmanhet (inte sa djupa som dessa). Den hogsta risken for sjalvmord foreligger i de yngre aldersgrupperna for bade man och kvinnor, medan kvinnor visar en ny topp mellan 50 och 60. Studie 5 Behandling vid sista kontakten fore sjalvmordet undersoktes och jamfordes med kontrollernas. Darvid delade vi upp sjalvmorden i dem som hade kontakt med kliniken i samband med sin sista depression fore sjalvmordet, dvs inom sex manader, da behandlingen kunde tankas ha effekt. Det visade sig att det inte fanns nagon skillnad i behandling mellan sjalvmord och kontroller ifraga om medicinering med antidepressiva eller elbehandling. Inte heller fanns det nagon skillnad i svar pa behandling i form av forbattring. Daremot hade kontroller som fatt elbehandling oftare fatt antidepressiva som uppfoljning. Detta tyder pa att uppfoljning med medicinering efter el-behandling kan forebygga sjalvmord. (Less)",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Both physical and mental health is intimately linked. People who have a significant mental illness are more prone to suffer from a variety of chronic physical diseases. People who have long-term medical issues, on the other hand are more than twice as likely to be depressed and anxiety as the general population. The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

      "title": "Prevention of psychotic disorders in the general population",
      "abstract": "Subthreshold psychotic experiences are widely reported within otherwise healthy populations. Their phenomenology is broad and very heterogeneous ranging from meaningful coincidences and precognitive dreams over haunting to out-of-body experiences and visual as well as auditory hallucinations. Although creative aspects of these experiences are implied too, a similarity in form and content to positive symptoms in schizophrenia (e.g., delusion, disordered thought, and hallucinations) or schizotypy (e.g. magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, ideas of reference or paranoid ideation) seems to be obvious. However, the borderline between normal and pathological experiences and behaviour is unclear. The so called “continuum approach” assumes that schizophrenia or schizotypy are not discrete or categorical illness entities. It implies a gradient in the severity of the symptoms, ranging from healthy population to full-blown schizophrenia. As such, psychotic signs are no longer restricted to formal diagnoses according to DSM or ICD, but would, instead, complete the spectrum of psychological and biological features that characterize individual variations among human beings. Can subthreshold psychotic experiences be integrated in this continuum? Do individuals indicating such experiences lack some social cognitive abilities and are particularly vulnerable to false inferences in their social world. How are these experiences related to increased neural activity or an abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission? These and similar questions will be discussed in the presentation.

      "abstract": "Lapses in psychic functioning, i.e., occurrence of certain psychological mishaps, e.g., making a slip of tongue, reading wrong word, stumbling in walking, forgetting to carry out an intended purpose, accidentally breaking or mislaying something, failing to recall what one ought to be able to recall, etc., have been attracting a great deal of attention during past fifteen or twenty years. Unfortunately for psychology, those who gave subject this attention approached it with a bias resulting from preoccupation with system of psychotherapeutics known as psycho-analysis. Owing to this bias these investigators found in these lapses confirmation of their theories about mental and they have used these lapses and their interpretations of them as a means of introducing uninitiated into mysteries of so-called new psychology. According to this new such lapses are not explainable by principles of orthodox psychology, are due to operation of mental processes of which individual is not and cannot be aware at time of lapse, are manifestation of activity within the of desires of a painful or disgusting or unthinkable nature, and betray something which individual does not want to know or have known about himself. In following analyses of such lapses (slips of tongue, etc.) as have recently come under my notice or have been studied by me, I shall show that such psychic mishaps or accidents can be satisfactorily explained by principles of orthodox psychology, do not involve unknown or unknowable mental processes, are not manifestations of repressed desires, are not unconscious betrayals of individual's secret self, and that they furnish not slightest basis on which to construct a psychology of unconscious. The careful scrutiny of circumstances surrounding lapses (slips, forgettings, accidental breakages, etc.) proves that these mistakes are results of verifiable psychophysiological processes, that known laws of orthodox psychology are adequate to explain them, that they are psychologically determined (not psychically determined), that they are not valid psychic acts and do not give expression to repressed, unknown, and unknowable motives of an undesirable, discreditable, or disgusting nature.

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "abstract": "Auras of somatic and visceral sensibility are commonly experienced as part of the epileptic sequence of events, and their divers varieties have been fully described in a prolific literature on the subject. The \"sensory march\" of the jacksonian fit and the variegated epigastric aura represent the sensory component of what may or may not terminate in the motor expression of the epileptic attack. These sensory manifestations may include the element of pain, but usually they are not confined to a single somatic segment or focal visceral area. Localized pain, as an isolated phenomenon not associated with somatic convulsive seizures or with other motor, sensory or psychic variants of epilepsy would rarely be considered a form of epilepsy even though its occurrence was episodic and paroxysmal. However, it was conjectured prophetically without benefit of electroencephalography by Wilson<sup>1</sup>in 1928. The frequency with which unexplained abdominal pain occurs both in children",

Anticipatory grief can be a particular challenge during palliative care. The family is recognized as the major source of social support and the environment in which grief is shared with others. Key risk factors for pathological bereavement outcomes can be identified on admission to palliative care, permitting preventive models of psychological care to be used through palliative care into bereavement. Models of therapy include supportive-expressive, interpersonal, cognitive behavioural, family focused, and specific therapy for complicated grief. Pharmacotherapy can judiciously accompany psychotherapy. Life-cycle issues include bereaved children, siblings, parents, and grief for the very elderly. Grief can be stigmatized and ambiguous in special circumstances, yet positive growth is a desirable outcome from any loss.",

His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

      "abstract": "Delicate diagnosis':avoiding harms in difficult, disputed, and desired diagnoses Life & TimesMedical diagnoses can be subject to ambiguity, flux, subjectivity, and inherent uncertainty.This is particularly true in primary care, where many reported symptoms do not conform to a clear diagnosis.Thresholds around normality are often unclear.Symptoms are commonly experienced and described as an 'iceberg'.Over a third of otherwise well people without a chronic condition have felt tired or run down, or had a headache in the previous 2 weeks, and over a quarter have had back or joint pain.Distinguishing conditions that would benefit from diagnosis and earlier intervention from those that are temporary, self-limiting, and prone to harmful medicalisation, remains challenging.While overdiagnosis is a diagnosis of a condition that, if unrecognised, would not cause symptoms or harm, contested diagnoses are symptoms given a diagnosis, but where the diagnosis, as an explanation for them, is controversial.Opponents consider contested diagnoses 'wrong' not because of an error in history taking, clinical examination, or interpretation of a test result (which would risk misdiagnosis), but because the diagnosis itself, for example, chronic Lyme disease or multiple chemical sensitivity, is invalid.Contested diagnosis is bordered by 'pseudoscience', for example, adrenal fatigue, leaky gut syndrome, and chronic candidiasis, which attempt to explain symptoms with 'science' that is demonstrably incorrect.Many contested diagnoses relate to symptoms that are not clear-cut, meaning that some people are given a diagnosis that does not confer benefit.Others are primarily unexplained 'yet'.For example, Gulf War syndrome was treated as a contested illness but is now recognised as caused by exposure to sarin gas.Other recognised conditions are prone to a variety of influences such that diagnosis risks causing harm, through a variable mixture of misdiagnosis, overdiagnosis, pseudoscience, or overtreatment.A framework for considering some conditions as 'delicate diagnoses' may help to recognise and reduce the harms of medicine in these circumstances.",

In most cases, patients with burning mouth syndrome have accompanying psychologic or psychiatric conditions. Consequently, the syndrome has traditionally been included among the psychogenic dermatoses. However, it is currently unclear whether psychologic factors are a cause or a consequence of the syndrome, or whether each exacerbates the other.

      "abstract": "A study about the problem of stress in physician who work in intensive care units requires a previous reflection about the stress concept itself. Selye's conception undoubtedly signified a great progress for the comprehension of the processes of biological adaptation, but it seems it can not be easily applied to the psychological and social field. The decrease of psychosomatic diseases during the last world war is one of the many examples that make question the causal relationship between stress and disease. The concept of life event in anglo-saxon psychiatry is also discussed, as well as its attempt to measure the stressor character of these circumstances through a scale of points. The concept of \"pathogenic situation\" of German psychiatry is proposed in exchange. From this perspective, medicine in general and intensive medicine in particular can be seen as human activities constituting \"pathogenic situations\" for the ones who exercise them. The corresponding literature allows to establish that medicine generates more pathology in physicians than other professions, but intensive medicine does not seem to be more pathogenic than other specialties. The elements of the \"medical act\" which could be responsible for the stress or pathogenic situation are studied. Respecting intensive medicine, two are the characteristics which seem to contribute to make it \"pathogenic\" for those who exercise it: a mistaken vision of death as an \"enemy\" which has to be fought à outrance, and the \"temporality of urgency\", proper to an ICU, which makes that the doctor can not give himself time enough for listening to the patient and telling him the adequate word of consolation.",

It is a common knowledge that comorbid anxiety and depression disorders can influence the course of various somatic illnesses and worsen their prognosis. We also have evidence-based studies that depression for example is an independent risk factor of heart infarct onset. On the other hand, we observe the somatization of clinical picture of mental disorders, the increase of atypical forms manifesting through pain or other somatic syndromes that leads to the increase of mental illnesses in the primary care. The research of common pathways of mental and somatic pathology should be the subject of further interdisciplinary research programs. The other issue is the patient's compliance that plays in important role in the success of every kind of treatment. Personality traits and status of mental health can influence ones attitude to illness as well as motivation to therapy.

      "title": "Medical Illnesses in Psychiatric Patients — a Review",
      "abstract": "Abstract There is a high prevalence of physical disorders in psychiatric patients. However, physical disorders often go unrecognised and untreated in routine psychiatric clinical practice. This paper reviews the available literature on the association between medical illnesses and psychiatric disorders. There is a well-established relationship between major medical disorders and most psychiatric disorders. Early medical diagnosis in psychiatric patients has important clinical significance. Physical disorders may coexist with psychiatric disorders or occur as side effects of psychotropic medications. It is important that psychiatrists perform adequate clinical examination of their patients in order to recognise and treat the medical disorders. Remedies suggested are adequate training and research, interdepartmental teaching programmes, refresher courses, and active consultation-liaison services in clinical practice. Key words: Anxiety disorders, Comorbidity, Depressive disorder, Schizophrenia Introduction Medical illnesses are more prevalent in psychiatric patients than in the general population. However, these often go unrecognised and untreated in routine clinical psychiatric practice. (1) Physical disorders may coexist with psychiatric disorders or may occur as side effects of psychotropic medication. Patients suffering from schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders have a higher rate of preventable risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet, and lack of exercise. (2) On the other hand, patients with physical disorders are likely to be non-compliant and have higher dropout, morbidity, and mortality rates. Despite the evidence, psychiatrists consider the medical care of their patients to be beyond the scope of their care. They are also reluctant to perform general physical examination of their patients, fearing that this would disrupt the therapeutic relationship. Two-thirds of psychiatrists have never performed physical examination of their patients. According to the available data, a physical examination is performed on only 13% of inpatients and 8% of psychiatric outpatients. (3) This is of increasing concern for mental health professionals in clinical practice. (4) All major psychiatric disorders, such as depressive disorders, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders are closely associated with physical disorders. By understanding the medical problems of psychiatric patients, psychiatrists can explain to their colleagues in other specialties some significant medical findings that may require immediate attention. Since physical and psychiatric comorbidity is relatively common in general practice, these aspects should be given equal importance. (5) Prevalence of Medical Illnesses among Psychiatric Patients Comorbidities between physical and psychiatric disorders are not uncommon. Over the last 30 years, several studies conducted to determine the prevalence of medical illnesses among psychiatric patients reported prevalence rates of 28% to 92% (Table 1). (6-14) In one study, physical illness was underdiagnosed and not diagnosed in 67% and 50% of the patients, respectively. (6) An unusually high prevalence rate of 90% was reported by a study that included 100 state hospital psychiatric patients who were consecutively admitted to a research ward. In this study, 46% of the patients had an unrecognised medical illness that either caused or exacerbated their psychiatric illness, 80% had physical illnesses that required treatment, and 4% exhibited precancerous conditions. (8) In a study by Bunce et al, 50% of 2395 psychiatric outpatients and 52% of 1448 psychiatric inpatients were found to have a major medical disorder. (10) In a study conducted in a public mental health system, 529 psychiatric patients were medically evaluated. The results revealed important physical diseases in 200 patients; 12% of the patients were found to have physical diseases. …",

      "title": "Cases of Senile Insanity, with Remarks",
      "abstract": "Admitting the difficulties that one has in the classification of insanity, it seems to me, at all events, reasonable that we should recognise classes associated with definite physical changes. Symptoms may be ever changing and deceptive. A patient may to all appearances be weak-minded, but on recovery it may be found that such patient's apparent abstraction and mental weakness were merely the result of an overbearing and overpowering sense of misery, so that, in fact he was suffering distinctly from melancholia, and the mental faculties were in abeyance through the assertion of other painful sensations. A severe grief or an intense occupation of any kind may make one forgetful of his surroundings, regardless of the state of the weather, the time of day, the condition of one's general health, and so on; and so it is that in many cases of profound melancholy there is an apparent arrest of function. This by the way. We have to consider the fact that at certain periods of life there are certain special tendencies to an intellectual breakdown. Any serious affection of the brain in early childhood so affects the as yet undeveloped structure that it totters readily to its fall, and, once having suffered a severe shock, it is with difficulty restored. In the period of adolescence other functions of the body are developed, and with them many stirring sensations are aroused, which have a great tendency to upset the highly nervous and unstable neurotic patient. As life progresses some people exhibit marked tendencies to die out through their nervous systems. Certain persons develope phthisis late in life; others develop cancer, gout, chronic rheumatism, or other constitutional vices. But the thing that interests me most in this consideration is that there are definite forms of disease seen in patients dying out from exhaustion or wearing out of their nervous tissues. As has so often been said, age is purely relative. A man may be a boy at 70 or an old man at 35. Age, from the physician's side, is a relative advance towards decay and destruction of the most important of the vital tissues and organs. A man may have all his organs slowly degenerating before he has reached middle life, the degeneration being due to some constitutional disease, or to some such condition as atheroma of the vessels. In an asylum one constantly comes across patients who have inherited insanity from their parents, and who have inherited a special form of insanity, and even others who have not inherited any special form, but have inherited the tendency which produced the insanity; thus whereas one person has atheroma of the vessels and dies of apoplexy, another has atheroma of his vessels and dies of aneurism, and another patient has atheroma of his vessels and angina pectoris, so that the offspring of these patients may have not only the atheroma of the artery, but either the apoplexy, the aneurism, or the angina pectoris, according to whether the parents had the one or the other. I have seen many cases in which a parent has suffered from mental disease only when he has become 60 or 70, and the children have gone on very well until they reached a similar age, and then have broken down under similar circumstances in a very similar way. It would not be right always to say that this has no relationship to mental effects and to predispositions. One knows that suicide, for instance, is not only associated with a family disposition to nervous disease, but is in many cases also associated with a dominant idea which has from early days been before the patient's mind—that suicide has been, as it were, the evil genius of the family; and so the fact that a parent has died of nervous breakdown has been reported to a patient, or has been remembered by him, and when he comes to a like age he necessarily thinks more about the fate of his parent, and this alone, in some temperaments, might be a cause of producing insanity. In some families it is very noteworthy that a certain age is looked upon as being critical, and if that age be satisfactorily passed, the individual may live to a considerable age beyond, but immediately before this crucial period many members have begun with ailments and have certainly worried themselves into their graves. But what I would distinctly assert is that in certain families the tendency is to die of some affection of the nervous system in preference to dying by any other system; and it is interesting to note that in some of these cases the tendency is not always transmitted in exactly the same way, but that the offspring of such parents, if they have not been placed in otherwise favourable circumstances, may break down earlier in life; and although I am not in a position to assert positively that such is the case, many instances have inclined me to the belief that the offspring of those parents who have broken down, say at the climacteric or from advanced age, are more liable than other insane patients to break down at special periods, such as at adolescence and the climacteric. When one comes to consider the changes that we mean by old age, I should say that the mark I have used as the test as to atheromatous condition of the arteries is seen by the tortuous temporal arteries, and the rigid and rather high-tension in the radial pulse. Other symptoms, such as capillary congestion about the cheeks, white hair, and a tendency to leanness, have, of course, been considered, as well as the condition of the eye called arcus senilis . All the patients to whom I shall refer have the above characteristics, as well as years over 60. They suffer either from progressive dementia, with or without paralysis, or from melancholia of one form or another. As we shall see presently, they suffered from hypochondriacal symptoms, or in some cases exhibited maniacal excitement with exaltation, and I shall have to refer specially to at least one case in which these symptoms were so markedly like those of general paralysis of the insane that I was constantly asking myself in what the difference consisted between our typical cases of general paralysis of the insane and cases such as the one under consideration. We were obliged to confess that if the patient had been brought before us, and that blindfold we had been told that his age was 35, we should not have hesitated for a moment in saying that his was a typical case of the disease. General paralysis does occur in old men sometimes as well as in young men, but it is not nearly so common, and when we meet with these cases wo are obliged to consider them as a special sub-variety of the disease, or else must look upon them merely as cases of degradation of nerve tissue, having somewhat similar symptoms, to the symptoms seen in general paralysis of the insane. I am rather fond of regarding these cases as not truly those of general paralysis, but as examples of progressive nerve degeneration, and I prefer to look upon symptoms of general paralysis of the insane as symptoms that are produced solely by a steady and progressive degeneration of the highest nerve centres; and under these circumstances I would expect that any disease which produced steady, progressive degeneration of these highest centres would also produce similar symptoms, just as in the lung, whether it be a tubercle, a mass of smoke, or a piece of steel or stone that sets up irritation, inflammation, degeneration, and a cavity, the course and symptoms of the disease are the same.",

      "abstract": "A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally are the result of infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to any of a variety of conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases. Central nervous system etiologies are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, and typically cause other neurologic signs. Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age. Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses also may cause nausea and vomiting. Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.",

In the past, these maladaptations after trauma were considered to be a reflection of personal weaknesses and were stigmatized. Now, after 30 years of research, the physiological responses to severe stress and trauma are being increasingly understood, as are the risk factors for a pathological response to trauma.

It includes: parts of the body being hurt, not having the usual abilities, medical problems or organ malfunction, microbial infections, health issues, having pain or bad symptoms, unusual body shapes. The study of disease is called pathology. Disease can be described as a medical condition associated with particular symptoms and signs. It can be caused by external factors like pathogens, or caused by internal malfunctions mainly the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity such as allergies and autoimmunity. Diseases are broadly classified to any abnormal condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, or death to the person affected with similar problems. It includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviours, and atypical variations of structure and its function and for others these may be considered as distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically and mentally, as living with a disease will alter the affected person's thinking ability. Death caused by disease are often natural. Diseases are categorised into four main types: infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, genetic diseases and physiological diseases. Diseases can be classified as contagious and non-contagious.

      "title": "[Functional somatic diseases--a review].",
      "abstract": "Functional somatic illness is a clinical concept used to define medically unexplained somatic symptoms considered to express psychological distress. Functional somatic illness may express underlying psychiatric disorders (e.g. fibromyalgia due to non-fearful panic disorder, irritable bowel syndrome due to bipolar disorder). Sustained physiological activation caused by stressful life events combined with catastrophic thinking may be another cause. Functional somatic illness may also be caused by classic conditioning of physiological responses that may have been triggered by biological or emotional stimuli. Operant conditioning may also be a cause. The therapeutic alliance relies on acceptance of the reality of the subjective complaints, without a priori acceptance of the patient's attribution of the cause of the symptoms. We recommend initial exploration of the patient's own ideas about aetiology, including appropriate medical tests. The physician should then change the agenda to a biopsychosocial perspective and identify current stressors and psychosocial variables that reinforce symptoms. Only a few randomised trials have been performed. They suggest that psychological treatment should be systematic and structured, with a focus on information, alternative ways of perception, and problem solving. Active forms of physiotherapy and psychopharmacological drugs may be of some benefit in selected patients.",

Tilstanden er vanlig etter ervervet hjerneskade. I artikkelen gis en oversikt over kunnskapsstatus om utmattelse etter hjerneslag og etter traumatiske hjerneskader. KUNNSKAPSGRUNNLAG KUNNSKAPSGRUNNLAG En vurdering av eksisterende litteratur, inkludert litteratursøk, samt vår kliniske erfaring ligger til grunn for innholdet i artikkelen. RESULTATER RESULTATER I eksisterende undersøkelser er det brukt varierende definisjoner av tilstanden og det er anvendt ulike kartleggingsverktøy. Forekomsten av utmattelse etter hjerneslag eller traumatisk hjerneskade er usikker på grunn av ulike inklusjonskriterier og kartleggingsmetoder og fordi ulikt måletidspunkt kan gi ulike prevalenstall. I flere arbeider anslås forekomsten til å ligge mellom 50 % og 70 %. Vår kunnskap om de patologiske mekanismene er svært begrenset. Både premorbide, sosiodemografiske, slag-/traumerelaterte og komorbide faktorer spiller inn på hvordan pasienten oppfatter tilstanden. Blant anvendte behandlingstiltak er psykoedukasjon, aktivitetsregulering, fysisk trening og behandling av komorbide tilstander. Det er også gjort forsøk med medikamentell behandling, foreløpig uten overbevisende resultater. FORTOLKNING FORTOLKNING Utmattelse er vanlig hos hjerneslagpasienter og pasienter med traumatiske hjerneskader og begrenser ofte i betydelig grad deres hverdag. Vår viten om patologiske mekanismer og behandlingstiltak er mangelfull, og pasientpopulasjonen er heterogen. Behandlingen er individuelt tilpasset og har som mål at den enkelte skal kunne bruke sin begrensede kapasitet på en mest mulig hensiktsmessig måte.",

Persistent headache, in particular, evokes concerns about an otherwise-overlooked underlying cause, although many chronic headaches are also primary (without a single underlying cause) in nature. The “state of the art” of pharmacotherapy for this primary headache syndrome is very much a work in progress. The recognition of a migraine component, or of psychological comorbidities is very important for these patients. Key nonpharmacological interventions are often most useful.",

      "title": "Reactions to stressful experiences",
      "abstract": "In biological terms, stress literally means a force from the outside world acting upon an individual, and is a phenomenon we have all experienced. The term ‘stress’ was first used in the 1930s by the endocrin­ologist Hans Selye to describe the responses of la­boratory animals to various stimuli. Originally, Selye meant ‘stress’ to be the response of an organism to a perceived threat or ‘stressor’, but the term is now used to mean the stimulus rather than the response in some cases. When presented with a stressor of any type, everyone will produce a reaction to that stress, and this is a normal physiological event. However, if the reac­tion is prolonged, too intense, or atypical in some way, stress can become abnormal and cause problems. Stressful events, even when reacted to normally, are important contributors to the causes of many kinds of psychiatric disorder. In this chapter, we consider those psychiatric disorders that are specific reactions to stressful experiences. These may occur independently or alongside other psychiatric conditions and include: … ● acute stress reactions: short- term disorders after stressful events; ● post- traumatic stress disorder: a disorder following exceptionally severe stress; ● adjustment disorders: conditions occurring after a change in life circumstances; ● grief reactions: the normal and abnormal responses to bereavement; ● reactions to special kinds of acute stress: for example, traffic accidents, war, earthquakes, etc… For all these conditions, an identifiable stressor is a necessary but not always sufficient factor in its aetiology. GPs encounter the vast majority of patients with stress disorders who present to the health services, but all clinicians will see these patients in their clinical specialties. The reasons for this are threefold: … 1 Acute physical illness and its treatment are stressful. 2 Chronic illness or disability can result in substantial changes in life circumstances. 3 Clinicians treat people involved in other kinds of stressful experiences…. Everyone reacts to stress differently, and what consti­tutes a stressful event is therefore highly subjective. However, there are certain situations that are likely to be experienced as stressful by anyone. The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale is a list of 43 life events which predispose to stress- related illnesses, weighted ac­cording to their respective probability of doing so.",

These symptoms typically dissipate over time, but the presence of PEs is associated with an elevated risk of developing a clinical psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia. In addition, PEs show associations with neuropsychological impairment and disturbances in brain structure and function. It is thought that PEs are driven by similar neurodevelopmental and environmental mechanisms, but it is unclear how similar the underlying pathways are. This chapter will discuss the cognitive difficulties and differences in brain structure and function associated with PEs. Then, it will examine these in relation to typical neurodevelopment and the course of impairment towards clinical psychotic disorders.",

Delirium is a transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment and other behavioral and psychological phenomena, with a relatively rapid onset and a characteristically fluctuating course. Though it is a common disease, it is frequently missed or misdiagnosed, which leads to a substantial attendant morbidity and mortality potential. Often delirium is due to multiple simultaneous causes, each one of which may or may not be enough to cause delirium by itself. We report a case of delirium accompanied by ataxia, depression and psychotic symptoms in a 72 year-old man with atrial fibrillation and intermittent trifascicular block. A careful history and examination with appropriate investigation allows underlying causes to be detected and treated. Clinical experience requires, therefore, to think of the crisis with a view to the difficult effort of composition and synthesis of a plurality of factors of various kinds (biological, psychological, and interpersonal). Those factors intervene in acute psychosis at different times and with different specific weights.",

Additionally, insomnia was related to decreased immune functioning. The data were inconclusive regarding insomnia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality, but sleep medication use was predictive of mortality. These results must be tempered with the knowledge that significant weaknesses existed in the studies reviewed. The main weaknesses were inadequate definition of insomnia and inadequate control for alternative explanations.

Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

Doctors tend to focus their attention on managing the seizures and the side effects, but may not be meeting all of the patient's needs because of differences between their perception of these concerns and the patient's. Further, psychosocial problems often are addressed only superficially or not at all during office visits. The challenge is to integrate quality-of-life issues into clinical practice and to better assess the patient's perception of the disorder, the seizures, and the medications, as they impact on cognitive function, emotional well-being, and social and economic functioning.",

In individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), reports of psychosis have included cases that would meet criteria for delirium, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, or major depression. The greatest interest, however, has been generated by the association between TBI and schizophrenia-like psychosis (Krafft-Ebing 1868), and this is the focus of this chapter. The most important question is whether TBI predisposes an individual to schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis. If this association can be unequivocally established, a number of other issues become relevant, such as the prevalence of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI, its clinical features, risk factors, and prognosis. An important corollary is whether the study of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI can advance the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Psychotic reactions in the context of meditation and esoteric practices have been described in the psychiatric literature. In most cases, these psychotic conditions are transient and do not lead to functional impairment. The authors present the case of a 46-year-old woman who had worked as a spiritual healer for several years and, in the course of this occupation, increasingly developed a highly specific configuration of psychotic symptoms (all of which could be convincingly traced back to the formerly used spiritual techniques) along with depressive symptoms and severe functional impairment. The differential diagnosis was initially complicated by the relative conformity of the patient’s psychotic symptoms with her occupational practices and the absence of other, more typical, symptoms of schizophrenia. Only a thorough anamnesis with another spiritual healer and precise identification of psychopathology helped to disentangle the merely uncommon from the pathologic features of this case. Possible mechanisms of psychotogenesis are discussed in light of the literature and the specific features of the presented case. Although a single case report cannot prove a causal link between spiritual healing and development of psychosis, the patient’s specific psychopathology, with preeminently disturbed self-experience, and its consistency with the patient’s spiritual practices suggest at least a contributory role in this case.",

      "title": "Cytochrome p4502D6 and Serotonin Transporter Polymorphism in Patient with Bipolar Disorder Type II",
      "abstract": "IntroductionBipolar disorder (BD) is a complex psychiatric entity, which represents a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. The very definition and classification of BD is determined by a range of possible clinical presentations, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from other psychiatric entities by means of a differential diagnosis, for example acute schizophrenic episode, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. Furthermore, BD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, especially substance abuse disorders, but also personality disorders or eating disorders, [1-4] which complicate the diagnosis and treatment further.BD can manifest itself for years with recurring depressive episodes before the first manic, hypomanic or mixed episode occurs. The depressive episode of the BD thus frequently remains unrecognised and misdiagnosed as a major depressive disorder (MDD), and therefore inadequately treated with antidepressant monotherapy. According to the current psychiatric classification DSM-V, BD is not diagnosed before an occurrence of a manic or hypomanic episode, while ICD-10 describes, besides a manic and hypomanic episode, a mixed episode in BD as well. [5,6] However, a clinician can consider bipolar depression based on clinical characteristic of depressive episodes. Disease onset before the age of 20, recurrent depressive episodes, which cause the person to be ill most of the time, failure to respond to antidepressants, severe psychomotor retardation, hypersomnia, increased appetite, presence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideations are frequently present in patients with bipolar depression. [7,8]Data on prevalence of mood disorders is significantly changing in the last decade. According to past epidemiological data, BD I is responsible for about 2% of prevalence among mood disorders, in the same percentage as BD II. MDD has been diagnosed in 86% of all patients with mood disorders, and non-specific mood disorder in 10% of the patients. Today, we believe that MDD represents 50 % of all mood disorders, BD I about 2%, BD II 15%, while 33% of mood disorders belong to a heterogeneous group of disorders from the bipolar spectrum. [9] Accordingly, it is necessary to adjust the pharmaco-therapeutic approach and introduce mood stabilizers to the treatment if BD or a disorder from the bipolar spectrum is suspected. Special attention should be paid to symptoms of the depressive episode, and all medical history data on patients with depression should be carefully analyzed for evidence of possible episodes of elevated mood in the past.Clinical research has shown that the individual therapeutic response to psychotropic drugs considerably varies, from tendency to develop side effects to therapeutic resistance. In the treatment of a depressive episode, about one third of the patients show no therapeutic response after an adequate therapeutic trial. [8] It is a well known fact the therapeutic response can be affected by different factors, such as the age of the patient, liver or kidney dysfunction, diet, smoking or excessive alcohol use. Recent research shows the lack of response to antidepressant treatment is associated with bipolar disorder, [10] and the association of other psychopathological phenomena with the lack of therapeutic response is also being investigated. However, it is believed that the genetic basis is of key importance for the variability of response to antidepressants. [11,12] Pharmacogenetics studies the influence of specific gene polymorphisms, which are responsible for the function of enzymes important in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.Biotransformation of most psychotropic drugs in the liver occurs via cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) superfamily, which consists of more than 50 different enzymes. CYP2D6 has an important role in biotransformation of a large number of antidepressants. [13,14] The gene that encodes the CYP2D6 is located at the locus 22q13. …",

The strangeness of its psychiatric manifestations, particularly the thought distortion and the flatness or inappropriateness of affect, seems to set them apart from common experience. Yet, like the affective syndromes, schizophrenia merges with the normal condition and with other psychiatric states. As in depression and mania, the seat of dysfunction is probably the limbic system and involves many brain systems. The aetiology is probably multiple, but in spite of a plethora of theories, the cellular mechanism remains obscure. However, there is growing evidence that schizophrenia is an organic psychosis associated with structural pathology in the brain.",

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

During mood swings, there may be features of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) that are mood-congruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

      "abstract": "The term psychogenic pain has been applied to pain conditions, including specific chronic orofacial states, that present without an adequate pathophysiologic basis to account for the pain. The position taken in this focus article is that the concept of psychogenic pain can be provocative and heuristic for research but that its use in clinical settings is highly problematic. Moreover, although the concept of psychogenic pain is provocative, the term psychogenic pain reinforces a dualistic notion about pain, as either psychogenic or not, that is contrary to current biopsychosocial models of pain. Based on such a model of pain, findings from neurophysiologic and psychologic research are incorporated into a discussion of issues central to the problem, including whether or not pain can arise in the absence of any pathophysiologic signals, indeed, in the absence of any observable physical signal, pathologic or otherwise. Finally, the suggestion is offered that current knowledge has led to a blurring of the boundaries between physical and psychological processes. Attempts to search for the biogenic versus psychogenic etiology of pain symptoms can only be unsatisfying and unproductive.",

      "abstract": "1. The clinical and post-mortem findings in an unusual case of Cushing's syndrome are described. There existed in this patient a depressive psychosis and an extrapyramidal neurologic disorder, the overt development of both being associated temporally with that of the specific endocrine disorder. It is suggested that the etiology of the complex clinical picture observed in this case may be a neuroendocrine disorder on an encephalitic basis. 2. A review of the literature reveals that mental symptoms not infrequently occur in Cushing's syndrome and that mental depression of varying degree has been a prominent feature in these psychiatric disorders. The mental symptoms may be a direct manifestation of the underlying specific endocrinopathy although the mechanism of their production remains obscure. The possibility that the form of psychiatric disorder, namely depression, in these cases bears a close relationship to manic depressive and involutional psychoses is pointed out. 3. Patients hospitalized with depressive psychoses should be carefully examined for evidence of Cushing's syndrome.",

A variety of acquired insults may present with remarkably similar seizure syndromes that are age-specific and evolve with time. This evolution may be a consequence of the brain injury itself or an alteration of normal brain maturation due to an unfavorable electrical environment. Idiopathic epilepsies are now being correlated with specific gene defects, particularly those involving ion channels and/or neurotransmitter receptors. Despite this specificity, idiopathic seizure syndromes may be caused by mutations in different genes or different mutations in the same gene, and particular syndromes may manifest heterogeneous clinical seizure types. Not all localization-dependent epilepsies are symptomatic, as a growing number of genes have been identified with partial seizure syndromes. Febrile seizures probably do not represent a homogeneous entity, but multiple disorders that may be associated with developmental abnormalities and various coexisting seizure types.",

Typical dream reports include such psychological features as hallucinations, delusions, cognitive abnormalities, emotional intensification, and amnesia. These five remarkable features of dreaming have invited its comparison to abnormal states of mind occurring during waking in certain clinical conditions, especially schizophrenia and organic syndromes. The exploration of the neurobiological basis of dreaming therefore constitutes not only an aspect of mind-body interaction but also a model approach to the study of mental illness. An obvious problem is that the unconfirmable nature of all subjective experience is compounded by difficult access to the mind in sleep. The recent development of sleep laboratory techniques has given the study of dreaming a more instrumental and systematic character, and the emerging picture encourages psychophysiological integration.",

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

      "abstract": "Pain is, according to the definition of the International Association for the Study of Pain, an unpleasant, sensory and emotional experience connected to real or possible tissue damage or descriptively in terms of damage. Pain is the most expressed symptom of every clinical picture of oral cavity disease and the reason for the patient to contact his dentist. The feeling of pain is individual, difficult to compare and measure. Depending on the time of its occurence, pain can be acute or chronic. Acute pain is fast and sharp, it occurs during stimulus application or immediately after the stimulus has been removed. Chronic pain is dull, slow, it appears intermittently or continually, it can be dependent on the stimulus or spontaneous. It presents more character variations than the acute pain. Such patients often come to the dentist's office, complaining about the pain which is not present at that moment. This makes diagnostics harder and widens the spectrum of pathological changes which may cause such pain. Various dental surgeries can cause painful sensations of different character, intensities and duration. It is necessary to diagnose painful sensations and to remove the cause. Prosthetic therapy can cause physical pain in many clinical phases, however, physical pain is also connected to prosthetic rehabilitation due to disrupted chewing, phonetic and aesthetic function which is ensured by a healthy and sanitized stomatognathic system. The fear of uncertainty of functioning and aesthetics without prosthetic work during the therapy implementation and the fear and uncertainty of the new prosthetic work has great effect on the patient's behaviour. The 'new' smile changes the patient's facial appearance. One becomes aware of that and engages himself in conversation with others more confidently. Properly performed prosthetic therapy raises self-confidence of a patient and can open up new opportunities in life. This is achieved by a therapist who can correctly and individually indicate prosthetic work and recognize the personality of a patient and thus adapt the way of communication during therapy. A dentist should not fear painful sensations that a patient complains about, but using his knowledge make the correct diagnosis, recognise his possible mistake at work and as fast and as more efficiently as possible reduce the feeling of pain.",

      "title": "Insomnia associated with medical disorders",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is frequently associated with different medical disorders. This may be due to a variety of reasons: repercussions on sleep of the symptoms pertaining to these illnesses, e.g. pain, dyspnoea, nycturia, reduced motility, pruritus; anxiety or even depressive moods induced by the handicap, a failure to understand the course of illness, sometimes the risk to life itself; the adverse effects of certain medications used. This chapter will deal with the sleep disorders encountered in heart, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, renal, rheumatic, endocrine and metabolic conditions. For insomnias related to neurological diseases, the reader should refer to chapter 57 \"Sleep and lesions in the CNS\" and for insomnia within a framework of fibromyalgia, to chapter 60 \"Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of sleep disturbances\". As a general rule, the treatment of sleep disturbances associated with medical disorders comes under the treatment of the diseases themselves. Nevertheless it is important to take account of the associated psychological factors, such as anxiety brought on by the illness, stress provoked by a stay in hospital, the possible pain involved in explorations, a scheduled surgical operation, which quite naturally lead to proposing anxiolytic or hypnotic treatment. But there may be drawbacks to prescribing such treatment: it may have a detrimental effect on the immediate course of illness, as in the effect of benzodiazepines on respiratory failure, for example; a risk of tolerance or dependency due to the chronic nature of the underlying illness, not to mention a lack of understanding of the hypnotic effects or non-effects on the sleep of subjects affected by various types of illness.",

      "title": "Basal Ganglia Disease And Depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases of the basal ganglia are quintessential neuropsychiatric disorders, characterized by abnormal movements, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms and signs. Depression is common in these illnesses and may occur at presentation or during the course of the illness. Individuals may present to the psychiatrist before seeing a neurologist. Depression is an important target for research, as it affords a unique perspective on the pathophysiology of basal ganglia diseases as well as an alternative method of understanding the biology of mood disorders. Traditionally, basal ganglia diseases are diagnosed and treated by neurologists, who define their onset by specific motor manifestations. Psychiatric symptomatology has been considered peripheral to the understanding of the motor disorders that define basal ganglia diseases. There is growing evidence for the contrary view that mood and affect are integrally related to the evolution of these diseases. For example, in diseases such as Huntington’s disease or Wilson’s disease, where the genetic mutation has been identified, it is possible to identify presymptomatic individuals, prior to the development of motor signs, who are unaware of their genetic status, and determine whether cognitive or psychiatric manifestations occur more often in gene-positive than in genenegative individuals. Another way to examine the role of psychiatric impairment is to study individuals in the general population who have undergone psychiatric assessments and to determine if individuals with a history of affective disorder are more likely to develop specific basal ganglia diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) than individuals without mood disorders. This chapter includes a review of the epidemiology, prevalence, and correlates of depression in basal ganglia diseases and their treatment.",

      "title": "UNEXPECTED AUTOPSY FINDINGS IN UNEXPECTED DEATHS.",
      "abstract": "Death is usually anticipated. Physiological death resulting from senility and the gradual wearing out of organs and tissues is probably an exceptional occurrence. The end usually comes as a culmination of some disease of whose ravages the clinician and the patient are aware. Sometimes it comes with suddenness as the result of an accident, of the imbibition of a poison, or of a sudden turn for the worse in an already existing disease, and sometimes it comes for no apparent reason. It is the unexpected cases of death to which reference is made in this paper. When one hears of an unexpected death, one's mind usually turns to two, or at most three, of the systems of the body. One thinks first perhaps of the circulatory system, and secondarily of the nervous and respiratory systems, and as a matter of fact, the majority of cases of unexpected death may be referred to one of these. But in the course of autopsy experience one learns that there is a wide range, in lesions of these systems, and that the primary cause of the demise may occasionally originate in other systems and tissues, although the actual termination of life may be due to the effect upon one of the three systems previously mentioned. The cases reported have, with a few exceptions been selected from a series of about 1200 autopsies performed at the Hamilton General Hospital during the past ten years. Many of the more unusual observations have been revealed in autopsies done on cases, which have been the subjects of coroner's investigations, and where little or no previous clinical history was available. No doubt some of the so-called unexpected findings",

Bei dieser sehr haufigen Diagnose in der Gastroenterologie ist das Zusammenwirken somatischer, psychischer und sozialer Komponenten bei der Entstehung und im Verlauf des Beschwerdebildes besonders zu beachten. Typisch fur das RDS sind abdominelle Beschwerden, Stuhlunregelmasigkeiten, sowie das Fehlen von organpathologischen Befunden, die die Beschwerden ausreichend erklaren konnten. Viele Betroffene suchen wiederholt Hilfe bei gastroenterologischen Spezialisten oder Institutionen. Da dieses Beschwerdebild sehr beeintrachtigend und fur einen Teil der Betroffenen auch sehr beangstigend ist, weisen diese auch haufiger (in Spezialzentren uber 60 %) psychische Storungen auf. Der Anteil von PatientInnen mit irgendeiner Form von psychischer Stressbelastung oder Traumatisierung (psychisch, physisch oder sexuell) in der Anamnese ist groser als bei anderen „organischen“ Erkrankungen. Wenn die Beschwerden nicht ausreichend erklart und behandelt werden, fuhrt dies haufig zur Erhohung des Leidensdrucks und zu einer weiteren „Hilfesuche“ bei den Betroffenen. Dies hat auch gesundheitsokonomische Konsequenzen mit Kostensteigerungen. Die Integration psychosozialer Faktoren im diagnostischen Prozess und eine psychosomatische Betreuung der RDS-PatientInnen sind daher besonders wichtig.

The Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is part of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), which were studied intensively within the last decades. In this very frequent diagnosis in Gastroenterology the interaction of somatic, psychic and social components in aetiology and the course of the illness should be especially considered. Typical symptoms in IBS are abdominal complaints, irregular bowel movements and lack of pathological findings, which could explain sufficiently the symptoms. Many patients seek repeatedly help from gastroenterological specialists and institutions. Since the illness is very impairing, and for some also terrifying, these patients show more frequent psychological disturbances (in tertiary centres more than 60 %). The proportion of patients with any kind of stress or abuse (psychological, physical or sexual) in their history is greater in IBS than in other “organic” diseases. If the symptoms are not sufficiently explained and / or treated, the suffering and health care seeking of IBS patients leads to health-economic consequences with increasing costs. Therefore the integration of psychosocial factors in the diagnostic process and the psychosomatic care of patients with IBS are very important.",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe.

Exhibitionism is characterized by “recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving the exposure of one's genitals to an unsuspecting stranger” (p. 569) that persist over a period of at least six months. A person must have acted on these urges, or the urges or fantasies must cause distress or impairment for the person to be diagnosed with the disorder.",

Some investigators tend to emphasize the effect of psychologic activity on electroencephalographic activity.† Others tend to regard the psychologic activity as the affected variable and the electroencephalographic activity as the causal agent variable.‡ Psychologic activity (itself a concomitant of some kind of cortical and subcortical neurogenic processes) can possibly have either an inhibiting or a facilitating effect on the functioning of another region of the brain showing abnormal bioelectric discharges. At the same time, a region of abnormal bioelectrical discharge may suppress or facilitate neurogenic activity—and thus psychologic activity—in the same region or elsewhere in the central nervous system. Experimentally and clinically, it is a difficult problem to determine",

There are also no reliable biomarkers or genetic markers for mental disorders. Psychiatric categories can be overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, but overdiagnosis is the more serious problem. The most frequently overdiagnosed categories these days are bipolar disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and post-traumatic disorder. A history of changes in the diagnosis of schizophrenia is presented to illustrate some of these problems.",

Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person′s family,work or school life and general health. Approximately 3. 4% of the patients with major depression commit suicide. Major depressive disorder is thought to result from the complex interplay of multiple inherited genetic factors and subsequent exposure to a wide range of environmental variables throughout life. The reciprocal connections between various brain regions and the neurochemical messengers involved in these connections are being increasingly studied from a systematic perspective. Furthermore,researchers are increasingly considering the impact of an individual psy- chosocial environment on brain chemistry,activity and anatomy,and vice versa. The impact of early childhood events in particular may have the long-lasting effects,especially if epigenetic changes are involved.",

Najcesce se javlja kao posljedica nakon moždanog udara, iako može biti uzrokovana i nekim drugim bolestima ili ostecenjima živcanog sustava. Kod osoba koje su preboljele moždani udar, hemipareza ce se obicno javiti na suprotnoj strani tijela od zahvacene strane mozga. Osim slabosti jedne strane tijela, osobe s hemiparezom nakon moždanog udara imaju razne motoricke poremecaje kao sto su poremecaj misicnog tonusa, pojava asociranih reakcija i kompenzacijskih strategija. Uslijed ovih motorickih poremecaja osobe s hemiparezom nakon moždanog udara imat ce poteskoce pri hodanju, narusenu preciznost pokreta, nesposobnost pri držanju stvari, smanjenje balansa i koordinacije, umor misica te opce nezadovoljstvo i iscrpljenost. Nakon preboljenog moždanog udara uz motoricke poremecaje javljaju se senzoricki i kognitivni poremecaji, a depresija je također jedna od ucestalih komplikacija. Zbog navedenih poremecaja vidljiva su znacajna funkcionalna odstupanja u podrucju mobilnosti, brige o sebi, života u domacinstvu, u radu i ostalim životnim navikama. Kvaliteta života u osoba s hemiparezom nakon preboljenog moždanog udara znacajno se mijenja, te se bolesnici moraju nauciti živjeti s nizom ogranicenja u razlicitim podrucjima života. Funkcionalna ovisnost povezana sa smanjenom sposobnosti brige o sebi i ovisnosti o drugoj osobi, smanjena drustvena aktivnost, pomanjkanje energije, psiholoske promjene nakon moždanog udara uzrokuju losiju kvalitetu života oboljelih. Brojne rehabilitacijske intervencije utjecu na poboljsanje funkcionalnog statusa i kvalitete života osoba s hemiparezom nakon moždanog udara. Cilj rehabilitacije u osoba nakon preboljenog moždanog udara je postici maksimalnu funkcionalnu sposobnost i sto vecu neovisnost u aktivnostima svakodnevnog života. Velik znacaj ima fizioterapijska intervencija koja može utjecati na brojne posljedice vezane uz senzomotorni i funkcionalni plan. Pozitivno utjece na abnormalnosti tonusa muskulature, narusenu mobilnost zglobova, smanjenu jakost i elasticnost muskulature, smanjenje opsega pokreta, prisutnost boli, poremecaj ravnoteže i koordinacije, poremecaj funkcije hoda i funkcije gornjeg ekstremiteta.

      "abstract": "Meige syndrome, a rare form of cranial dystonia, manifests as involuntary spasms affecting the facial and neck muscles. Diagnosing Meige syndrome is challenging due to its similarities with various movement disorders and psychiatric conditions. Functional neurological disorder (FND) refers to a condition characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with recognized neurological or medical conditions. Symptoms may include motor or sensory disturbances such as weakness, tremors, paralysis, or seizures. Importantly, these symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition or by the direct effects of a substance. Instead, they are believed to stem from psychological factors. This case demonstrates the diagnostic dilemma of Meige syndrome. It was initially misdiagnosed as a functional neurological disorder in a 42-year-old female. The difficulties in differentiating between these disorders highlight the necessity of a thorough evaluation and increased clinical suspicion in cases of movement disorders. For treatment outcomes to be optimized and to resolve patient distress, prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential.",

      "title": "Psychomotor Epilepsy in Childhood",
      "abstract": "The most poorly understood and most frequently misdiagnosed seizure state of childhood is psychomotor epilepsy. Difficulties in diagnosis are related to the variety of possible clinical manifestations which characteristically differ from one child to another. In addition, psychomotor epilepsy can occur at any age, even during infancy. Therefore, the child's ability to verbalize the perceptive and affective sensations of this seizure state is obviously limited by his chronologic age. The diagnostic dilemma is further complicated as physicians tend to confuse psychomotor seizures and petit ma! epilepsy. INCIDENCE AND ETIOLOGY The terms psychomotor and temporal lobe epilepsy are often used synonymously and interchangeably. At times the seizure state may also be called uncinate epilepsy, epileptic automatisms or epileptic fuges. However, not all psychomotor seizures are associated with temporal lobe lesions, nor is temporal lobe pathology always productive of psychomotor epilepsy. Abnormalities and electrical foci from areas other than the temporal lobe can produce this seizure state. For these reasons, the term psychomotor epilepsy is preferred, and temporal lobe epilepsy, if used, should be restricted to those psychomotor seizures that result from primary temporal lobe pathology. Ten to 20% of children in most pediatric seizure clinics have psychomotor epilepsy. Focal lesions are often considered to be the responsible etiologic factor, but diffuse encephalopathies, above all in children, are more commonly encountered. Prolonged febrile convulsions, perinatal trauma and hypoxia, craniocerebral trauma or meningoencephalitis can be the specific etiologic condition. Expansive lesions including neoplasms, vascular malformations, cysts and abscesses must be considered, especially when there is clinical or electrical evidence of a focal lesion.",

The etiology of any anxiety is sought in early conditioning life experiences; here it may be related to infants' responses to first teething. The universality of dental anxiety makes it a paradigm of psychosomatic disorders. These are conceptualized as pathologic exaggerated reactions to early traumatizing events, a causality not unlike that of conversive-hysteric symptoms or \"normal\" bodily characteristics. Psychiatric-etiologic considerations of dental anxiety are not to be found in the literature. Recalling the cheerful manner in which children's loss of their first tooth is greeted, one gathers that repressed ambivalence is involved. A clarification of the etiology is here attempted and the dynamics compared with those of other psychosomatic diseases.",

Depression is a common mental disorder usually starts in early adulthood that presents with depressed mood loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration. It usually occurs as a result of adverse life events, such as: losses of a significant person, object, relationship or health, stressful life, sedentary life and lack of occupation but it can also occur due to no apparent cause. These problems can become chronic or recurrent and lead to substantial impairments in an individual's ability to take care of his or her every day responsibilities As…",

      "abstract": "The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been labelled a 'psychosomatic' disorder for more than 50 years, although continuous research has neither proved nor disproved or condoned nor condemned involvement of psychosocial factors in disease onset and course. Psychopathological personality traits and illness behaviour have been found frequently in patients with IBS, who have been shown to experience more life stress than healthy subjects; stress responses as well as pain perception have been found to be abnormal, and psychotherapy has been found to be more effective than medical treatment alone. While these studies indisputably show that psychosocial factors are involved in IBS, they also support the notion that what may be true in one patient may not be so in another, and that IBS — from a behavioral point of view — may not represent a unique psychosomatic entity.",

Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

      "abstract": "Dissociated states represent pathological conditions where psychological trauma may emerge in a variety of forms such as psychic dissociative symptoms (hallucinations, derealization etc.) or on the other hand as somatoform symptoms (paroxysms, loss of motor control, involuntary movements etc.). Recent findings suggest that neurophysiological level of dissociative phenomena may be linked to the same neurophysiological principles that emerge in multi-stable perception of ambiguous stimuli likely caused by competing interpretations with mutual exclusivity. At this time there is evidence that temporal lobe seizure activity can produce dissociative syndrome and from these findings may be inferred that temporal lobe epileptic activity existing independently of neurological focal may share common neurobiological mechanism with dissociative symptoms. This conceptualization of dissociative phenomena is also in accordance with findings that originate from the study of the relationship between epilepsy and mental illness. The relationship was for the first time described in Meduna's concept of antagonism between epilepsy and psychosis and from the study of forced normalization introduced by Landolt in 1950s. The findings reported similar pathological conditions as in dissociative states when psychopathological symptoms and paroxysms may represent two different forms of the pathological process. Following the concept of forced normalization Tellenbach in 1965 introduced the term alternative psychosis implicating that stopping seizures does not mean vanishing or inactivity of the pathological state and that the epilepsy is still active subcortically and supplies energy for psychopathological symptoms. In the present review chaos in brain neural networks as a possible explanation of the relationship between dissociation and epileptic activity has been suggested that represents testable hypothesis for future research.",

      "abstract": "Neurosyphilis presents a significant diagnostic challenge in psychiatric settings due to its highly variable neuropsychiatric manifestations, which can mimic a range of other psychiatric disorders. This case report describes a 36-year-old male admitted with acute psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior. His clinical history revealed previously treated syphilis, with no subsequent follow-up, and recent progressive cognitive and behavioral changes, ultimately leading to a diagnosis of neurosyphilis (specifically general paresis) following serological confirmation. This case highlights the complexities in diagnosing neurosyphilis, as its symptoms often overlap with common psychiatric conditions, making it easy to overlook in routine assessments. Importantly, the diagnosis required a high index of suspicion due to the patient’s psychiatric presentation combined with a background of untreated syphilis. Considering neurosyphilis in the differential diagnosis can be challenging, especially when psychiatric symptoms like depression, cognitive decline, and psychosis appear in the absence of clear neurological signs and when there is no follow-up on prior infections. The resurgence of syphilis and its neurological complications remains a concern, particularly in psychiatric populations where risk factors such as substance use disorders, socioeconomic challenges, and limited access to healthcare are prevalent. This case underscores the critical role of psychiatrists in screening for syphilis, especially in patients at risk or in areas with high syphilis prevalence. Early and accurate diagnosis, coupled with appropriate treatment using penicillin, can halt disease progression and mitigate severe neuropsychiatric outcomes. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis in psychiatric patients and considering neurosyphilis in cases of unexplained psychiatric symptoms.",

Consequently, it is necessary for clinicians to learn to distinguish between \"primary\" psychiatric illnesses and those disorders of behavioural control and mood that stem specifically from brain injury. There is relatively little in the clinical literature that explains the relationship between variable states of behaviour, mood or temperament, and clinical disorders that may have long-term implications for patient management.

      "title": "The psychosocial effects of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES)",
      "abstract": "What are Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures? A recent research study conducted by Flinders University explores the experience of a disability which is both hidden and lacks physiological ‘evidence’; a condition which is not understood by health professionals, and results in individuals feeling confused and isolated. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) (also called pseudoseizures) are events resembling epileptic seizures, which are not associated with ictal electrical discharges in the brain but by psychological processes. PNES may be triggered by anxiety, psychological tension and heightened defence against intense emotions. In some cases PNES may be a result of psychological trauma, previous psychiatric history, physical and sexual abuse or posttraumatic stress disorder (Fiszman, Alves-Leon, Nunes, Dandrea, & Figueira, 2004). Health professionals often overlook PNES due to the common misconception that they are “fake” (Benbadis, 2005) or are categorized as a “non-disease” (i.e. not epilepsy) (Bodde, et al., 2009). However, this is a very real condition, with considerable psychosocial implications. People diagnosed with PNES feel anger, shame, helplessness, and experience suicidal ideation (thinking about suicide with some intent but without actually making plans to commit suicide) (Thompson, Isaac, Rowse, Tooth, & Reuber, 2009). Stigma is often attached with this label, fuelled by poor understanding and little education and support following diagnosis (Benbadis, 2010). One complicating factor is that an individual may experience both PNES and epileptic seizures. 15% of people with diagnosed PNES also have epilepsy (Benbadis, 2010), and it is estimated that 10 to 50% of individuals with “intractable seizures” (seizures not adequately controlled by AEDs) have either lone PNES or a combination of epileptic seizures and PNES (LaFrance, et al., 2006). Co-morbidity can cause significant diagnostic and management issues, with health professionals often unable to accurately identify the cause of seizures, and thereby communicate and manage them appropriately. The current study aimed to further explore the psychosocial effects of PNES and their implications for the development of appropriate multidisciplinary support and management strategies.",

      "abstract": "Acute pain is \"the barking police-dog of our health\". It represents an efficient system of information introducing or evoking a series of defensive mechanisms concerning acute illness, whereas the chronic ache is senseless, because it doesn't take over any protective functions; on the contrary, it burdens the total organism, especially the vegetativum and the psyche as well. Chronic pain very often renders independent, then it is no longer any symptom of a disease, but the disease itself: the idiopathic or unspecific syndrome of pain. Analyzing, for example, rheumatological aspects of a case, you can recognise that there exist continuous transitions from concrete local pain to diffuse indefinite psychalgia, whilst that gliding scale is more and more defined by psychic causes. Many aspects of cases imply a lot of such components. Obviously those syndromes of diseases are increasing where only pure psychosomatic facts exist, that is to say when soma is not the primary source but the scenery.",

Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

It is particularly important to distinguish between the functional and organic psychoses, and with the organic psychoses to search for the underlying cause, which may be reversible. Functional and organic psychoses can usually be differentiated after careful psychiatric and medical evaluation. Often it is difficult to separate psychiatric geriatric disorders from medical disorders because the presenting symptoms can be mixed or atypical. A sudden change in an elderly patient's psychiatric condition should alert the attending physician that the condition might be caused by a delirium superimposed upon the original psychiatric illness.",

Disorders of the nervous system can ruin the lives of individuals and are of such a magnitude that they create many of our greatest social problems. People become mentally ill, insane, or psychotic and a few such individuals in a society can destroy its fabric. People can become addicted to drugs. They can ruin their lives, and their habits create an underworld willing and able to exploit them. Some people become alcoholics. The chapter discusses about schizophrenia disorder. The primary characteristic of schizophrenia is the impairment of logical thought processes. Speech is often bizarre and confused, reflecting a disturbed mind. Thoughts that are usually only remotely connected emerge together in speech (loose associations), and in extreme cases speech may be completely incomprehensible. Depression is another behavioral disorder. It is diagnosed as being either primarily endogenous or exogenous. The endogenous form of depression refers to severe depression that occurs in the absence of any identifiable external source; the exogenous form of depression results from external stresses.",

      "abstract": "Postpartum is not a specific entity. There is neither a very specific psychopathology nor evidence for a specific aetiology. The prevalence of severe is not significantly enhanced in the year as compared to women of the same age group without delivery who have quite a high prevalence of anyway. Incidence of milder might slightly be enhanced in the first weeks. Giving birth and adapting to the new mother role seem to be stressors contributing to the outbreak of in vulnerable, predisposed women or to enhance pre-existing depression. Biological, especially hormonal, as well as psychosocial factors can be relevant stressors in this situation. Although this is not a specific entity, the diagnostic term or specifier postpartum depression might still be justified, as in early motherhood shows many important specifities. Diagnosis is especially difficult, as women, due to shame, stigma and many fears, do not seek help and doctors, due to misinterpretation of symptoms, often do not recognise the severity of the situation. Untreated, these disorders can have especially severe consequences, not only for the mother, but also for the child and the whole family. These disorders therefore need our special attention and special treatment. This means modifications of our pharmacological, non-pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment methods. Therapy - although in principle the same as that of other depressive disorders - has to put a special emphasis on the needs of the period. Education about the fact that this is a disease and not due to failure as a mother is of utmost importance to relieve the patients from feelings of guilt. Counselling and practical advice for the mother and her family is often needed as well as the help of a midwife, a family nurse, a social worker and/or other health care professionals. A good mother-infant bonding should be a main concern from the start. This means that the mother should not be separated from her infant for longer periods of time. However, she needs a lot of help in order to allow for relaxed contacts with the infant. Pharmacological treatment is often complicated by the patient's desire to breast-feed, yet there are no controlled trials of antidepressant treatment during lactation as regards the potential side effects and/or long-term consequences for the infant. On the other hand, the risks of ongoing severe are generally regarded as higher than the potential risks of medication. Thus, if a mother insists on breast-feeding, she has to be educated about side effects and the baby has to be carefully monitored. Several studies have in the meantime also shown positive effects of oestrogen substitution and non-pharmacological treatments such as bright-light therapy. Psychotherapy should be initiated as soon as possible and be very supportive in the beginning. Specific manualised forms of psychotherapy for women with have also shown very promising results. In the future, more emphasis should be laid on prophylaxis, specific education and the broad implementation of low-threshold services. Under all circumstances, special attention must be given to the mother-child-relationship, on the one hand to reduce feelings of guilt in the mother and thereby to enhance the process of healing, on the other hand to prevent traumatisation of the infant and to avoid deleterious long-term consequences.",

      "title": "Hallucinations and Delusions",
      "abstract": "Defining terms is an appropriate introduction to this chapter. Hallucinations imply seeing things that are not truly present, or hearing illusory voices or music. In DLB and PDD, hallucinations are nearly always visual and manifest as seeing nonexistent people or objects, such as strangers in the house or yard. The affected individual may realize that he or she is experiencing a hallucination, but some people may not recognize that these are not real. In other disorders auditory hallucinations may be present, such as hearing voices. However, such auditory hallucinations are rare in Lewy disorders. Delusions are defined as false, often irrational beliefs. Frequently, these will have a theme, such as the conviction that someone is spying, or paranoia about friends or neighbors. A common theme is spousal infidelity, sometimes nonsensical, such as an older adult’s accusations of their mate starting an extramarital affair after 50 years of marriage. Capgras syndrome is an uncommon but striking example of delusional thinking in which the spouse or other immediate family member is accused of being an impostor. Hallucinations or delusions may occur in Parkinson’s disease in the absence of frank dementia. However, dementia is the usual setting for these problems. Hallucinations are much more common than delusions. Sometimes they are very limited, perhaps only present at night. Hallucinations are a contraindication to driving a motor vehicle, for obvious reasons. The fundamental cause of hallucinations and delusions in DLB and PDD is the Lewy neurodegenerative process. The precise region of the brain that is responsible is not known, however. These often occur in the absence of any external provocative factors. However, medications are notorious for inciting such problems in susceptible people. Chapter 7 focused on simplifying medications especially for this reason. Drugs for parkinsonism are well-known culprits, in particular two classes: (1) the dopamine agonists: pramipexole (Mirapex), ropinirole (Requip) and rotigotine (Neupro patch); and (2) anticholinergic drugs: trihexyphenidyl (Artane) and benztropine (Cogentin). Carbidopa/levodopa by itself may provoke hallucinations, but that is not very common unless combined with other drugs for parkinsonism.",

Equally important is the relationship of physical factors in the genesis of ‘psychological’ disorders. So intimately related are the two categories of causes and of effects that their separation amounts, in principle, to a falsification of the issue—a recourse to dogmatic artificiality. In modern psychological and psychiatric circles the differentiation of psyche and soma has come to be recognized as a gratuitous over-simplification that cannot do justice to the essential facts. A sick man is a sick man whether his illness arises primarily in structural defects or in his life experiences. It is less than scientific to confine attention to either the somatic or the psychological facet of the total individual. The physician is doing less than his full duty to the patient when he fails to give his attention to the real etiology, whatever it may be, and to utilize appropriate therapeutic agencies of any legitimate sort whether drugs, hormones, physical therapy, re-education, or what not.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "abstract": "La prise en charge des troubles mentaux résultant d’une affection génétique reste complexe actuellement. D’une part, l’offre de soins psychiatriques spécifique destinée à ces populations particulières est quasiment inexistante et, d’autre part, le diagnostic d’une affection somatique qui est à l’origine des symptômes psychiatriques n’est pas souvent posé si les points d’appel cliniques somatiques ne sont pas au premier plan. La question de l’organicité des troubles mentaux est pourtant majeure puisque 6 % des psychoses seraient secondaires à une affection organique. Il s’agit essentiellement de psychoses observées dans un cadre syndromique. Notons ici qu’il est également fort probable que certaines psychoses isolées (non syndromiques) aient une composante constitutionnelle, c’est-à-dire que leur survenue pourrait être favorisée par une constitution génétique particulière. La méconnaissance d’une pathologie sous-jacente à des troubles d’allure psychiatrique peut induire une véritable « perte de chance » pour le patient. Parmi les affections somatiques responsables des troubles psychiatriques, les affections cytogénétiques (par exemple, la microdélétion 22q11, le syndrome de Prader-Willi ou le syndrome de Smith-Magenis…) occupent une place importante et restent parfois méconnues et difficiles à repérer. Les maladies héréditaires du métabolisme (comme la maladie de Wilson ou les troubles du cycle de l’urée…) sont également pourvoyeuses de troubles mentaux. Le point important est que certaines de ces affections sont accessibles à un traitement étiologique, d’autres pouvant bénéficier de soins de stimulation adaptés au déficit. Fort de ce constat, il nous est apparu important de pouvoir développer un outil en direction de ces patients afin d’organiser le dépistage, des soins spécifiques et des stratégies de réinsertion socio-professionnelle. Parallèlement, nous avons constaté que les patients déjà pris en charge pour une affection génétique en Centre expert ne bénéficiaient pas toujours de soins psychiatriques adaptés, faute de connaissance précise de leurs difficultés. Le « Centre régional de dépistage et de prise en charge des troubles psychiatriques d’origine génétique » s’est structuré à Lyon en décembre 2012 grâce au soutien de l’ARS Rhône-Alpes et à une collaboration étroite entre les services de psychiatrie et de génétique clinique. Ce centre accueille et évalue les patients selon un protocole particulier qui sera détaillé.",

Analyzing the clinical picture of hypomanic states, stress was placed on the notion of the coexistence of logical thinking (and in some cases these thinking patterns are concerned with a feeling of heightened cognitive ability) with thinking styles based on logical errors.

Symptoms of vertigo, dizziness or unsteadiness can be present in diseases from many organs and systems so the doctor should not automatically equate dizziness with the inner ear. “True” or rotational vertigo implies involvement of the semicircular canals or their central connections, usually the brainstem or cerebellum. However, patients with fainting or syncope syndromes can describe transient rotational feelings as well. It is often the accompanying symptoms and presentation pattern that leads to a diagnosis. Some of the questions doctors should try to answer are: Is this a single, prolonged attack of vertigo, as in vestibular neuritis or brainstem stroke? Is this a recurrent vertiginous syndrome, as in vestibular migraine or Meniere’s disease? Are there any associated migraneous features like in the former or aural symptoms like in the latter? Are the symptoms provoked by lying down/turning over in bed, as in BPPV, or only occur whilst standing up as in postural hypotension? Are there any associated brainstem symptoms as in TIAs or demyelination? Is the patient chronic “dizziness” a progressive gait disorder? Carefully enquiring about the nature of the symptom (vertigo, dizziness, fainting sensation, unsteadiness), presentation (acute, recurrent, chronic, progressive), duration and triggers is vital in reaching a diagnosis.",

      "title": "Abdominal Pain: Is It in the Gut Or in the Head?",
      "abstract": "It is in both. Many years have gone by since physicians used the naive dichotomy of mind versus body to differentiate \"real\" from \"imaginary\" diseases. Of course, the \"real\" ones were those that the physician could touch, see, photograph, or analyze under the microscope and the \"ones in your mind\" were those associated with disorders of function or with emotional distress. The implication was that the conditions the physician could not see were either feigned or not as important. Now we know that the gastrointestinal tract functions as a sensory and motor organ and that in each individual brain and gut have a constant exchange of information. Rare are the conditions that affect solely one domain and not the other. Even conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, in which the presence of bleeding and inflammatory changes provide legitimacy of real disease, are associated with high levels of mental disorders and treatment of the psychologic co-morbidities is often associated with significant improvement in quality of life (1). In other conditions, classically considered purely psychiatric, such as depression, there is a high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and evidence of abnormal gastrointestinal function (2). The recent observation that some functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) may be associated with subtle inflammatory changes (3) is blurring even further the distinction between organic diseases and functional disorders. An example of the complex interaction between mind and the gastrointestinal tract is the observation that patients who develop an intercurrent bacterial colitis are more likely to develop irritable bowel syndrome if the infection occurs at a time when there are more stressful events in the individual's life (4). Also, animal models of neonatal maternal separation (a stressful event perceived by the mind) have suggested that physical or emotional distress early in life may prime the gastrointestinal tract to develop visceral hyperalgesia (a gut dysfunction often found in FGID) (5). An observational study in Sweden has even suggested that gastric intubation in healthy newborns may be associated with late development of FGID (6). There is increasing evidence that corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) modifies gastrointestinal function and new therapeutic strategies for FGID are beginning to target its function (7). In the context of such observations, the classic diatribe between diseases primarily coming from the head or from the gut seems futile and obsolete. Unfortunately, the bias against symptoms associated with disorders of function and with psychologic distress is still present in many health care providers (8) and patients and sabotages the development of ideal treatment strategies. There continues to be a hierarchy of stigma with health care providers and patients often feeling more comfortable dealing with organic diseases that with functional disorders and even less at ease with psychiatric illnesses. The Table summarizes some of the abnormalities in gut and brain function described in children with FGID.TABLE 1: Abnormalities in gut and brain function described in children with FGIDMost of the gastrointestinal dysfunctions refer to the areas of motility and sensation. Heterogeneous abnormalities in antroduodenal motility have been described in small groups of children with severe abdominal pain. More recently doubts have arisen about the etiologic role of motility in causing symptoms in FGID. There is often little correlation between abnormal contraction patterns and symptoms. It is now believed that patients with FGID are more likely to manifest an abnormal response to a physiological stimulus, such ingestion of food or release of gastrointestinal hormones, rather than have baseline dysmotility. Perturbance of gut motor reflexes may contribute to abnormal transit and onset of symptoms. Hypersensitivity has been demonstrated in all areas of the gut in response to balloon or gas distension in adults with a variety of FGID. It has recently been shown by using PET and functional MRI technology that adults with irritable bowel syndrome show an aberrant brain activation pattern both during noxious rectal distension and during the anticipation of rectal pain (28). Psychological factors, such as degree of parental anxiety, may be important in determining how a child and his caretakers react to a symptom and in health care seeking behavior. THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS In view of the interaction between gut and psychologic factors in generating symptoms in FGID it is clear that one cannot strive to cure the patient or treat the illness, until it becomes clear that there is only one health; the individual's health. Despite the fact that for years FGID were synonymous with \"motility disorders\", drugs that have targeted gut motility, such as antispasmodics or prokinetics have traditionally provided disappointing results (29). Treatment might be most effective if all aspects of the physiology of pain are addressed at once, within a bio-psycho-social model of care (30). Such an approach aims at treating peripheral and central neurologic sources of pain, as well as promoting behavioral changes for better coping with pain. Establishing a \"strong\" patient-physician alliance may be as effective as any other pharmacological or behavioral intervention to improve the patient's symptoms. Serotonin is found both in the enteric and the central nervous system and has recently emerged as a key mediator in modulating visceral sensitivity and motility. Interestingly, it has been reported that some of the medications who bind to serotonin receptors may exert their effects by modulating both gut and brain function (31). Low doses anti-depressant drugs, which inhibit serotonin uptake, facilitate endogenous endorphin release and have action the descending inhibitory pain control system, may benefit children with pain predominant FGIDs (32). Biofeedback, hypnosis, and other cognitive behavioral treatments have been beneficial in many conditions associated with chronic pain, including childhood FGIDs. \"Alternative\" treatments focusing on the \"MindBodySpirit\" connection have also great potential to impact functional disorders by modulating belief system and behaviors (33).",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli. The specific problems of children and adolescents (aged 13 to 17) with sacro-lumbar myelomeningocele have been discussed on the basic of a pilot study conducted at the hospital in Radziszów in the years 1996-1998.",

ETIOLOGIC FACTORSThus, among the underlying causes of convulsions are uremia, eclampsia and other toxicoses; several varieties of trauma, as birth trauma and that from blows on the head; certain intracranial irrita- tions, as brain tumors and cerebral hemorrhages; certain infections, as syphilis and varieties of meningitis; certain conditions of cerebral maldevelopment accompanied by a degree of brain cell deterioration; and certain conditions of the pituitary gland causing a change in its secretion.I believe, therefore, that convulsions, whether periodical and termed epilepsy, or not, are due to definite pathologic cerebral tissue changes which may be congenital or induced, and hence, that epilepsy is an organic and not a functional condition.In the toxic and pituitary cases there may exist previous malformation and instability of the cortical cells, or, on the other hand, it is perfectly conceivable that the toxic substance or the changed pituitary secretion may produce their own cortical cell deterioration.I published a paper on the relation of the pituitary gland to some cases of epilepsy, and in 19141 and again in 1916,2 a paper on the subject of hypopituitarism in its relation to epilepsy.These papers were the result of a personal suggestion of Dr. Harvey Cushing and also of the perusal of his most excellent book.",

      "title": "[Subjective syndrome after head injury].",
      "abstract": "DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS: Post-traumatic or post-commotion syndrome is one of the most controversial entities in studying consequences of craniocerebral trauma. Part of this problem arises from impossibility of adequate translation of the term brain concussion. Post-concussion syndrome is a broader concept than post-commotion and includes, if not a whole, than part of the post-contusion syndrome. There are also some other terms in the literature: post-traumatic syndrome, post head injury syndrome, post head injury syndrome or symptoms and the old term post-traumatic encephalopathy. Terminological imprecisions have not been solved yet, but the notion itself is determined by relative standard symptoms often associated with closed craniocerebral trauma, but without precise connection with the severity of the trauma. In the classification of mental disorders and behavior disorders, this syndrome is coded as FO7.2.In regard to the etiology of this syndrome some authors speak in favor of psychogenic and some of organic etiology, while Levin considers symptoms of post-commotion syndrome to start as organic and persist as psychic. Wechsler classified subjective disorders after head injuries into 4 categories: simulation, traumatic hysteria, traumatic encephalopathy and traumatic neurosis. The author does not deal with the origin of symptoms, whereas the classification itself suggests priority of psychic to organic factors (11). Those who speak in favor of organic etiology, think that axon damage and neuron damage are organic substrate in mild brain injuries, while fibrous degenerations of the cerebral hemisphere and brain stem are the organic base in severe traumas. On the other hand, many scientists primarily point to psychic moments, especially to importance of aggravation and simulation as well as compensation or rental neurosis in persistent post-traumatic syndrome. Most scientists agree that personality characteristics influence the development of post-traumatic syndrome and can predispose aggravation and simulation, whereas these symptoms more often occur in neurotic persons. The latest investigations reveal that classification in regard to etiologic factors--organic and psychogenic--is an anachronism. Long and Novac state that 80% of persons with cerebral trauma spontaneously speak about symptoms of the post-traumatic syndrome, while by targeted evaluation the percentage rises to 90%, so that they think that universality of symptoms points to their common origin.If the post-traumatic syndrome is though of as a line with organic dementia at one end and traumatic neuroses at the other, then this syndrome can be placed at different positions. Some authors put it close to the neurotic syndrome or regard it to be the neurotic syndrome itself, while others, mostly due to homogenity of the clinical picture, believe that this syndrome has an organic cause.",

Most of the patients who use the services of the Kainuu Central hospital pain clinic suffer from low back pain. IASP (International Association of the study of Pain) defines pain as unpleasant sensory or emotional experience with possible or clear tissue damage, or which is described at the same way. Acute and chronic pain differ from each other clearly. Acute pain warns about danger that is threatening the human body. This starts us to evaluate the situation and to act upon the danger. Behind an acute pain is always some somatic disturbance or disease. Acute pain causes also many changes in the autonomic nervous system; blood pressure, muscle tension and heart rate raise when the body is in the alarm position. Chronic pain doesn't warn the body about threatening danger because clear pathology doesn't always exist. Chronic pain reduces human life. It causes zest for life, tiring and reluctance. The chronic pain brings also following symptoms: sleeping disturbances, depression, social isolation, unemployment and loss of control of life.",

At least one of the symptoms must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech. There must be continuous signs of the disturbance for at least six months, although the duration may be shortened with appropriate treatment. The symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin between the ages of 15 and 30 years. Active symptoms are typically preceded by a prodromal phase, marked by a decline in academic and social functioning. The assessment of an adolescent with suspected schizophrenia should include a psychiatric assessment and complete medical history to rule out medical conditions that mimic psychosis. The primary treatment is antipsychotic medications. Adjunctive psychological and social interventions can improve treatment adherence and clinical outcomes.",

The individual who initially experiences these delusional thoughts is referred to as the primary case, while the subsequent transmission of these beliefs to another person designates them as the secondary case. Typically, this phenomenon arises within close interpersonal relationships, such as familial or intimate partnerships. The primary case is typically diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, while the secondary case, lacking any previous psychiatric history, develops similar delusions as a consequence of close contact with the primary case. It is important to note that the specific shared delusional beliefs can exhibit considerable variability, contingent upon the nature of the primary case's delusions and their influence on the secondary case. Common types of shared delusions encompass persecutory, grandiose, erotomanic, somatic, jealous, and religious misbeliefs. Moreover, it is imperative to recognize that the particular delusional content observed in cases of Folie à Deux can be subject to significant variation, potentially influenced by cultural, interpersonal, and environmental factors.",

In this concluding paper we review the historical and theoretical background, discuss the evidence and theoretical positions in the contributions, and draw some conclusions. Traditional psychosomatic models had less predictive value and less therapeutic importance than what was hoped for. The main problem with these models was the lack of a pathophysiological explanation for why psychological problems could be related to somatic disease. Sustained arousal or \"allostatic load\" offers more plausible and acceptable mechanisms for pathology, and, to some extent, for sensitization and illness. The combination of cognitive psychology and neurophysiology offers a model for somatic pathology, and, perhaps more important, also for the understanding of subjective complaints and illness.",

      "abstract": "Stressful or traumatic life events can lead to emergence of mood episodes. Events such as migration, relocation, job loss, bankruptcy, economic loss, divorce, natural disasters, accidental injury, or the loss of a loved one can trigger the first episode of bipolar disorder. After such life events, symptoms of depressive episodes often appear. Funeral mania, on the other hand, is defined as the emergence of manic episodes following the death of a close family member. Information on funeral mania, which occurs shortly after the loss of a loved one, is limited with a few case reports. In this study, a 26-year-old female patient who presented with the symptoms of a manic episode for the first time after her father's death and who had no previous psychiatric disease or treatment history was presented in the light of findings in the literature. It is noteworthy that the patient, who was followed up with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (mania period) according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, had a temporal closeness between her mood symptoms and her father's death, and had not developed such a reaction to previous traumatic life events. Therefore, the diagnosis was evaluated as funeral mania. It should be kept in mind that, although rare, symptoms of mania can be seen among possible grief reactions.Strese neden olan ya da örseleyici yaşam olayları duygudurum dönemlerinin ortaya çıkmasına neden olabilir. Göç, taşınma, yer değiştirme, işini kaybetme, iflas, ekonomik kayıp, boşanma, doğal afetler, kaza sonucu yaralanma ya da yakınını kaybetme gibi olaylar bipolar bozukluğun ilk hastalık dönemini tetikleyebilir. Bu tür yaşam olaylarından sonra genellikle depresif dönem belirtileri ortaya çıkar. Cenaze manisi ise, yakın bir aile üyesinin ölümünü takiben kişide mani dönemi belirtilerinin ortaya çıkması olarak tanımlanmıştır. Sevilen kişinin kaybından çok kısa bir süre sonra ortaya çıkan cenaze manisi ile ilgili bilgiler kısıtlıdır. Konu ile ilgili az sayıda olgu bildirimi mevcuttur. Bu çalışmada babasının ölümü sonrası ilk kez mani dönemi belirtileri ile başvuran, öncesinde herhangi bir psikiyatrik hastalık ve tedavi görme öyküsü olmayan 26 yaşındaki kadın hasta literatür bulguları eşliğinde sunulmuştur. DSM-5 tanı ölçütlerine göre bipolar bozukluk (mani dönemi) tanısı ile izlenen hastanın duygudurum dönemi belirtileri ile babasının ölümü arasındaki zamansal yakınlık olması ve önceki örseleyici yaşam olaylarına bu şekilde bir tepki geliştirmemiş olması dikkat çekicidir. Bu nedenle olgunun tanısı cenaze manisi olarak değerlendirilmiştir. Olası yas tepkileri arasında nadir de olsa mani dönemi belirtilerinin görülebileceği unutulmamalıdır.",

      "abstract": "One of the challenges in acute stroke management is accurately differentiating between actual ischemic events and other conditions that mimic stroke. In a cohort of 821 consecutive patients admitted to an acute stroke unit, 13% were incorrectly diagnosed as stroke [1]. In another cohort of 411 patients, it was estimated that 19% of patients presenting to the emergency department with stroke-like symptoms ultimately have other diagnoses such as a postictal state, metabolic disturbances, and systemic infections [2]. Regardless of the actual percentage, it is clear that not all cases of acute stroke-like symptoms are true strokes and other mimics should be considered. One such mimic is factitious disorder. \r\nFactitious disorder is a psychiatric condition in which afflicted individuals exaggerate symptoms and even endorse medical illness, or psychological trauma in order to draw attention or sympathy to themselves. The DSM-IV criteria for this disorder are: 1) Intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological signs or symptoms; 2) The motivation for the behavior is to assume the sick role; and 3)\r\nExternal incentives for the behavior such as economic gain or avoiding legal responsibility as seen in malingering, are absent [3].\r\nHere, we present a case of a patient who was diagnosed with factitious disorder after he presented to two different institutions with acute stroke-like symptoms and received tissue plasminogen activator\r\n(t-PA) twice within the span of 3 weeks.",

      "title": "‘Causal relation between spasticity, strength, gross motor function, and functional outcome in children with cerebral palsy: a path analysis’",
      "abstract": "SIR–In their recent article1 Kim and Park fail to deal with the entirety of Dr Lance’s classical definition of spasticity.2 His carefully drafted statement documented the consensus of the 1979 symposium of 44 actively engaged neurological investigators (including me): ‘Spasticity is a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (‘muscle tone’) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome. This did not preclude discussion of other features of the upper motor neuron syndrome resulting from release of flexor reflexes, such as flexor spasms, or the negative symptoms such as the pattern of weakness and loss of dexterity caused by withdrawal of the influence of descending motor pathways.’2 Thus spasticity is not a subjective symptom like headache or diplopia. It is rather an objective observation of the professional examination, like a cardiac murmur or a dilated pupil. There is abundant evidence that the truly disabling negative symptoms, often more impaired dexterity than strength, are directly correlated with the degree of disconnection of the target motor neuron population from the complexly integrated control of forebrain and hindbrain nerve structures. This loss of fine control and force is neither augmented by antagonist muscle stretch reflexes3 or improved by systemic medication, fusimotor blockade,4 or dorsal rhizotomy.5 Nor is the degree of clumsiness directly correlated with the prevalence of spasticity.6 The Ashworth Scale has never been more than an amateur parascientific game, with personal impressions of stiffness and absent replicable physical parameters. Recently, Fleuren et al. 7 have gone to the trouble of proving that the Ashworth Scale is worthless. Occam’s razor requires cessation of the senseless and useless demonization of the spasticity epiphenomenon. Absent evidence-based potions, patients should be assisted to practice toward maximal autonomous function.",

      "title": "Making sense of the role of sense organs in trichotillomania",
      "abstract": "Hallopeau, a French dermatologist, coined the term trichotillomania to describe alopecia (baldness) caused by self-traction of the hair, but the term now encompasses the entire syndrome of pathological hair pulling.[1] In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5),[2] the major change for trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) is the fact that it and related disorders now have their own chapter in the obsessive–compulsive disorder section. Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) includes recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss, repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling, and the hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Furthermore, the hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a dermatological condition), and the hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder). There has been lot of debates and discussion if trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder, obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder, or should be classified as a category of body-focused repetitive behavioral disorder.[3] Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) has been moved to obsessive–compulsive and related disorders in DSM 5; however, in International Classification of Diseases-10, it is classified under habit and impulse control disorders.[4] Lifetime prevalence rates of trichotillomania have been estimated to vary from 0.6% to 3.6%. Trichotillomania often begins or is recognized in late childhood or early adolescence with an average age of onset around 13 years and displays a chronic but fluctuating course.[5] It involves an individual recurrently pulling hair, generally one hair at a time from any part of his/her body, the head, eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, genital area, underarms, chest, legs, or other area. The scalp is the most common area. Pulling typically is done with the fingers, but tools such as tweezers, brushes, or combs may also be used.[6] Trichotillomania is associated with a significant functional impairment and psychiatric comorbidity across the developmental spectrum. As trichotillomania usually strikes during the sensitive developmental years, it can be especially disabling. Young adults with trichotillomania report impaired school, work, and social functioning, lowered career aspirations, and missed work days. Pulling can also negatively impact family functioning, contributing to family arguments, and secrecy, which in turn can increase stress and exacerbate trichotillomania symptoms. Adults also report that spending considerable financial resources on concealment methods and on treatments.[7] POINT OF VIEW The majority of literature and definitions focus on the act of pulling the hair, the preceding tension, and the relief of anxiety following the act. A variety of factors such as a sensation of itch, boredom, mood changes, stress, and negative emotions serve as triggers to pull the hairs.[8] Pre- and post-pulling activities are documented in literature but are mentioned just as activities surrounding the hair pulling. They receive little or no attention in the whole diagnosis, understanding and management of the disorder. There are lack of satisfactory explanations provided for majority of the postpulling activities and behaviors. An article by Woods and Houghton[5] mentions \"Rituals and behavioral patterns often precede pulling, such as combing through the hair, feeling individual hairs, tugging at hairs, and visually searching the scalp and the hairline. Pre- and post-pulling behavior are also clinically relevant. Although some individuals simply discard pulled hairs, others may play with the hair between their fingers, inspect the hair, bite the hair between the teeth, or ingest all or parts of the hair\". Activities surrounding the hair pulling provide pleasure to the persons with trichotillomania which probably acts a positive reinforcement to pull the hair. The pleasure may come through various sensory modalities which may vary from person to person. If hair pulling is only the primary goal, the patients should just pull the hair one by one and throw which hardly happens. They are involved in varied activities seeking pleasure involving all the sense organs which may vary from person to person. Antecedent activities such as feeling the texture of the hair, twirling, curling, grooming, combing, desire to have an even hairline, identifying the right hair, and then, the particular hair is pulled, all involve the touch sensation. The pulled hair is actually visualized for its characteristics such as length and color which involves the visual modality. The hairs are rubbed against each other, the snap pulling sound involves the hearing modality; at times, patients do even smell the hairs mixed with sweat to experience pleasure (Olfaction). Swallowing, tasting, the whole hair or a part of the hair is widely reported in literature which may be a way of experiencing the hair or else why should a person interested in only pulling the hairs swallow it. Oral behavior using pulled hair is present in half the patients and 5%–18% ingest their hair.[9] Trichophagia is a condition where persons swallow hair. Few patients swallow only the root of the hair called trichorhizophagia. Trichobezoar is a condition wherein swallowed hair starts accumulating in the stomach over a period to form a concretion which presents later with features of malnutrition and intestinal obstruction.[10] In a study by Grant et al.,[11] the rate of trichophagia in 68 individuals with DSM-IV-TR trichotillomania was approximately 1 in 5 (20.6%). CONCLUSION All the sense organs are involved in the varied pre-/post-pulling activities which vary from person to person and serve to maintain the behavior by reinforcements. It is also possible that in a subset of people, the pleasure-providing behaviors are these surrounding acts and hair pulling is just the modality of fulfilling it. Our diagnostic guidelines focus only on the hair pulling act. The behaviors surrounding the hair pulling problem will further help in the psychological management and also bring new insights into this poorly understood illness.",

      "abstract": "Kernaussagen Definition und Diagnostik Die Diagnose Anpassungsstörung gehört zu den im DSM-IV und im ICD-10 eher weniger gut operationalisierten Kategorien. Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

      "title": "A study of hysteria among youth in a secondary school in Malaysia",
      "abstract": "Hysteria is regarded as a symptom of emotional disturbance and mental disorder that is common among adolescent girls. It often occurs in schools during classes. Hysteria often begins with one student and subsequently spreads to other students, as many as 20-50 at one time. Its bizarre symptoms include sudden shouting, struggling, crying for no reason, talking unintelligibly and body paralysis. Previous research on hysteria by psychologists, psychiatrists and physicians from an alternative Islamic approach has identified many factors that cause hysteria. Hysteria may be related to cultural factors or to individual values and beliefs. Psychologists believe that the main factor in hysteria is emotional stress experienced by the patient. The hysterical reaction is one way for these patients to release emotional stress. Teenagers who suffer from uncontrolled stress may express themselves through hysteria. Psychiatrists suggest that hysteria may occur as a result of extreme emotional stress arising from long, unresolved and unexpressed emotional conflicts. In 2008 and 2009, hysteria occurred frequently among adolescent students in Malaysia and involved students in both boarding schools and day schools. This is an alarming situation for schools and parents because this phenomenon has an effect on the learning process and a psychological impact on students. Therefore, this study examined the phenomenon of hysteria to identify its factors, symptoms and treatment. The respondents included 41 girls who experienced hysteria at one school in Selangor, Malaysia. This study was conducted with questionnaires and interviews. Hysteria can be caused by psychological factors, psychiatric disorders and the cultural and religious factors. Common symptoms of hysteria include difficulty sleeping, aches and pains, extreme anxiety, hallucinations and nightmares. Hysteria can have a psychological effect on adolescents who experience it. Therefore, ways of managing hysteria must be identified, especially from a psychological perspective.",

Прекращение данной трудовой деятельности приводит к стрессу, нередко с последующим развитием посттравматического стрессового расстройства и стресс-индуцированных заболеваний. При этом клинические проявления самого синдрома эмоционального выгорания не исчезают, а лишь трансформируются с присоединением различных психосоматических нарушений. Таким образом, пожилые, страдающие синдромом эмоционального выгорания, являются группой риска в отношении формирования и развития заболеваний, связанных со стрессом, и нуждаются в пристальном наблюдении в рамках обязательной программы диспансеризации.",

In neurophysiological terms, pain is experienced when selected areas in the limbic system, particularly neurones in the cingulate gyrus and related areas of the somatosensory cortex are excited at the same time . Physiologically, this condition arises when nociceptors in peripheral tissues are stimulated, as is the case following trauma in acute pain or in inflammatory pain (nociceptive pain). However, it is not uncommon that excitation of limbic and related somatosensory cortical neurones originate from abnormal, usually damaged, peripheral or central nervous tissue (neuropathic pain) or as the consequence of psychological mechanisms (psychogenic pain). For the individual it does not matter how the typical state of limbic and somatosensory cortex excitation comes about, because the end result is just as unpleasant.",

These symptoms are found to be independent from other symptoms in longitudinal and cross-sectional assesments. The negative symptoms are named as primary or idiopathic if they are present at beginning of the disease or if it is specific to the disease. If they are due to positive symptoms, drug adverse effects or depression they are named as secondary negative symptoms. Treatment approach depends on whether negative symptoms are primary or secondary. Deficit syndrome is described by primary negative symptoms presenting at the beginning of disease, emerging spontaneously and staying stable during the disease course. Recent reports showed that deficit syndrome differ on disease course based on neurocognitive measures, functioning, and structural imaging. The role of negative symptoms in clinical diversity of schizophrenia was aimed to be evaluated in this paper by elobarating negative symptoms in various dimensions such as clinical features, biological measures, quality of life, and response to treatment.",

As a society gets more developed and informed, the frontier between moral, religious or social problems and psychiatric disease tends to be a frequent object of reflection. In the past many medical conditions (such as epilepsy, mania and several psychosis) were inicially considered moral or social problems. On the other side, nowadays, Psychiatry is often asked to act in disruptive situation: difficulty in controlling impulses, aggressive behaviors and criminality. The authors present some case studies of personality disorders, in which the principal symptom at admission was violent behavior. The psychiatric action was limited by therapeutic solutions and ethic issues. According to literature there’s an association between personality disorders and criminal behavior. Antisocial personality is a strong predictor of violence and aggression. The clinical cases presented confirm these findings.",

It is divided into: non-specific back pain, back pain associated with radiculopathy and back pain associated with another specific cause. Non-specific low back pain is the most common type, it makes 85% of all cases. It is important to exclude „red flags“ – symptoms and signs that could indicate serious etiology of back pain while taking history and during physical examination. If serious pathology is suspected, patient should be reffered to a specialist. Radiological diagnostics and additional tests are not necessary in patients with non-specific low back pain and low back pain with radiculopathy in the first 4-6 weeks. The most common causes of non-specific low back pain are: muscle and ligament strain, degenerative changes, spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. The most common causes of back pain with radiculopathy are disc herniation and spinal stenosis. Back pain caused by other, specific causes is rare and potential causes are numerous. Psychogenic and psychosomatic back pain require multidisciplinary approach . Yellow flags and Waddell signs can help in diagnosis. Non-specific low back pain and back pain with radiculopathy are treated with NSAIDs or acetaminophen and muscle relaxants, along with other recommendations. The patient must be instructed to come for reevaluation in 1-3 weeks. Patient should also receive education on preventive measures.",

The phenomenon of becoming ill on weekends and/or during vacation has been termed \"leisure sickness\". Attempts to understand this problem can be found in the current literature. Vacation for the wrong motivations or a mismatch between leisure activity and personality are some of the reasons. Other reports show associations between similar health-affecting patterns and personality traits or increased stress, but these factors have not been directly linked to leisure sickness before. Indeed, leisure sickness is not a specific defined illness yet but is more an accumulation of different symptoms that lead to indisposition. If leisure sickness is not only a phenomenon but is actually a real illness, it is seriously preventing people from the benefits of leisure time on the one hand and directly affects vacation experience with respect to destination, hotel and other tourism products on the other hand. Therefore, leisure sickness deserves further investigation.",

In this paper a pragmatic distinction has been made between Primary Study Difficulty and Secondary Study Difficulty, and between various subcategories of the latter. Useful as such a classification may be it remains, like most classifications, somewhat arbitrary and artificial. In any given case it is usually possible to relate a student's presenting complaints to a variety of factors, and to discern a subtle intertwining of cognitive and emotional determinants.

      "title": "Is musical hallucination an otological phenomenon? a review of the literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Musical hallucination is the subjective experience of hearing music, or aspects of music, when none is being played, and as such is a disorder of the processing of complex sounds. Objective of Review: To determine the extent to which the otological system is responsible for musical hallucination, and to evaluate approaches to clinical management. Type of Review: A review of all studies and literature reviews pertaining to musical hallucination, supplemented by inclusion of informative case reports. Search Strategy: A systematic search of multiple databases carried out on 22nd March 2009 was complemented by referral to the reference lists of included manuscripts. Results: Although not always troublesome in itself, musical hallucination can be a marker of underlying pathology in the ear or brain, or indicate obsessive‐compulsive traits or social isolation, and is likely to be clinically underreported. Associations have been reported with hearing loss, female gender, social isolation and being over 60 years of age, although it is rare even in this group, and these may well not be independent risk factors. Robust comparative analysis of these factors with controls has yet to be undertaken. Underlying causes include neurovascular pathology, psychiatric disorders and opioid medications, however these are absent in the majority of cases. Conclusions: This review supports the proposal that the otological system plays a role in the pathogenesis of musical hallucination. Hearing impairment may act as an initiating factor, and the primary dysfunction is overactivity of auditory association cortex, although an impairment of higher‐level inhibition does also seem necessary. Once underlying sinister causes have been excluded, first line treatment should be explanation of the condition and optimisation of hearing. Medications have a role only in selected patient groups.",

This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

Very rarely, a patient may feign homicidal intent for the primary purpose of remaining in the role of patient (factitious disorder). Although factitious disorder with psychological symptoms has been described in a variety of circumstances, the psychiatric literature lacks any reports of factitious homicidal ideation. This is a report on the case of a patient who was civilly committed on numerous occasions for protracted periods based solely on his self-professed homicidal ideation. The case raises both forensic and clinical questions and reinforces the authors' belief that further investigation is needed to develop more sophisticated methods of detection, evaluation, and treatment of factitious disorder with psychological symptoms.",

Psychiatric illness offers a special challenge in that few psychiatric diagnoses have associated physical pathology but are diagnosed purely on subjective report. This leaves those with psychiatric illness potentially open to the accusation their illnesses are merely feigned. Theoretically, malingering is distinguished from psychiatric illness by the absence of psychopathology, the identification of ‘secondary gain’, and a conscious intent to deceive in order to obtain the gain. However, psychopathology is hypothetical, secondary gain is non-specific, and the determination of the extent that intent is conscious probably impossible.",

This is a condition in which the patient experiences physical symptoms, for example blindness or paralysis, without obvious organic cause.

Also, those with personality disorders in addition to other psychiatric disorders, such as depression and antisocial personality disorder, are likely to have more health problems than those without personality disorders. People with active borderline personality disorder have been shown to have more medical problems than those with remitted borderline personality disorder. Personality disorders can complicate the course of chronic medical illnesses. Finally, the use of psychotropic medications is not unusual in personality disorders and in itself can be associated with medical illnesses.Clinicians caring for people with personality disorders need to be aware of possible medical comorbidity. More research is needed.",

It is an all-encompassing fatigue that results in a dramatic decline in both activity level and stamina. This syndrome is not new and has a long history. CFS is diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. Although pathalophysiological abnormalities exist across many domain, but several lines of research suggest that it may be distinct from psychiatric disorder. The nature of the symptoms, however, can help clinicians differentiate CFS from other illnesses. Center of Diagnosis has developed diagnostic criteria as based upon symptoms & exclusion of other illness. Treatment of CFS is sympom based and include pharmacological, cognitive and behavioral therapy, with lifestyle exercise and lifestyle management therefore the assesment and treatment of CFS should be multidirectional and taliored to the need of patients.",

The nervous tension, caused by the irritating atmosphere of great cities, is obviously conducive to psycho-neurotic troubles; and, if a rigorist educative influence saddles a hypersensitive temperament afflicted by these troubles, with the result that religion is misconceived as a repressive legalism, the effect will almost inevitably be a false conscience perhaps for ever paralysed by scruples. Whenever it makes its appearance and for the same reasons, this disease either suddenly breaks out in a violent crisis or gradually spreads in a slow, consuming progression. Much has been written about this malady : descriptions of the disorder, descriptions of the supernatural trial, the attitude to be taken towards the scrupulous by confessor and director, psychotherapeutic treatments or others in obstinate and disconcerting cases. It would seem that nothing has been overlooked and that the subject is therefore exhausted. One is tempted to conclude : the whole question has been settled once and for all. Nevertheless the scrupulous remain. It is in the West among Latins that scrupulosity is found in its endemic state, whereas it is unknown among Eastern Catholics and Orthodox . . .’",

      "abstract": "THE cases of melancholia narrated in the former papers have exihibited-1. Alterations or lesions of the moral faculties as a morbid degree of depression, grief, anxiety, fear, etc.; 2. Alteration or lesion of the psychical or intellectual faculties, as false per ceptions, false conceptions, illusions, delusions, etc.; and 3. Alterations in miiotility; but, so far as we have yet gone, only an excessive motion or restlessness has been illustrated. There are cases in which the pro minent feature is a lesion of motility, but which con sists in an indispositioni t-o move-in torpor of rmove ment. Cases of this kind are next to be detailed. Bearing in mnind that the lesion of the moral faculty appears to be, as it were, the starting point or ground work of the disease, it would appear that cases are to be met with in which the whole of the phenomena seem to be confined to this division of the mental faculties, while in other cases this groundwork is in volved with one, or chiefly with one, of the other sub divisions. On the one hand, we m-neet with cases in .which the motility is scarcely affected; or, on the other hand, we findl cases in which the psychical func tions appear but very partially implicated. It is a common cause of surprise to the friends of melan cholic patients that the melancholic talks or writes quite rationally or coherently; that he is quite cor rect in memory; or that he argues as acutely as ever. When, however, there is torpid condition of the mo tility, the patient, though he often retains his intel lectual powers nearly intact, bears the expression of the lowest degree of dementia; the features are dull and heavy. The Frenlch call this form mnelancolie avec stupeur. Tphe next case is of this kind, and the intellect proper -was only partially implicated. CASE ix. A. K., aged 34, married, wife of a butler, was formerly a lady's maid. She lived, previously to her marriage, eleven years in one place, anAd married the butler. This appears to have been an unfortunate match. The famnily miiade frequent inquiries about the patient. The husband has taken very little interest abouat her. He attributed her disease to stubborn ness; and recluested by letter that she imiight be treated with firmness anid well routed. The medli cal cerltificate accompaiving the order of admission gave tlae following description of the patient just prior to her reception:- She sits weeping and miserable; says she has broken her husband's heart; that shle is better without food. Her landlord and fellow-lodgers found her in a state of comiiplete ex hauistion fromii wvant of food. The clhildren also ap peared half-famiished. She declares she heard voices forbidd!inu her to eat or cdrink, or light fire, or go to becl. In this hearing of voices there was evidence of dis tinct intellectual or ply,ychical disturbance. It never, however, manifested itself afterwards. On aclmission (Oct. 21st, date of disease uncertain), she conversed quietly and correctly, though in a weak tone of voice. She said slhe had been living in London with her children in a lodging. She had no headache. The tongue was much furred. The bowels were con lined. She took beef-tea only for dinner. She had no thirst. Pulse 60, feeble. There was no cough, nor any morbid chest-signs. She was ordered full diet, one eog, and two glasses of wine daily. Oct. 24th. Sho was up; was pale, but had consi derable turgescence of the vessels of the conjunctiva. The tongue was red; bowels not open. An aloetic draught twice a day was ordered. It will be sufficient to describe the progress of the case by entries taken at the different epochs. During the first three months, she continued constantly de pressed; was always more or less indisposed to exert herself; would not dress herself. She declinecl in strength, but made no complaint. During my temu porary absence from home, her head was shaved and blistered without apparent benefit. The bowels con tinued obstinate; but she would seldom take an aperient; and she occasionally refused food. Jan. 8th (three months after admission). She varied from day to day. One day she refused all food, and said she did not require it; that she could do without it. Another day she ate ravenously. The bowels seldom acted. She refuised medicine. She emaciated visibly. Pulse 70, regular. There were no cough nor chest-symptoms. She was always listless and depressed. The expression of the features was dull and heavy. Jan. 13th. Her mind was in the same state; but she ate ravenously. She would gorge herself if not watched; she filched the meat from the other patients' plates. Jan. 0Oth. She again refused food. She sat moodily in one position for lolng periods. Her features were dull and expressionless. She allowed the nasal secre tion and saliva to dribble from her as she sat. Feb. 10th (fotur months after admission). Motility was still more involved. She sat for lonog periods in one posture, apparently indifferent to all around, aand too lazy to move. She was like a statue in immobility; but the attitude was expressive of hebetude. She hung her head; the features were relaxed, and did not change; her arms dangled by the side of the chair as she sat. The secretions were dropping from the mouth and nose, and the lacrymnal secretion had dried upon her cheek. The breathing was slightly acceler ated. Her bowels were confined. She was at the pre sent date eating largely. Three grains of podophyllin were ordered. Feb. 26th. She was moving down the gallery at a snail's pace. Her head was drooping, and her arnms hanging heavily by her side. Her dress was neglected. She had not menstruated since admiiission. Compounlld iron mixture was ordered. March 2nd. She would not take the medicine; was still more dull and heavy. She stood about in one positioni, obstructing the passage, and did not moive to allow olne to pass. She appeared motionless and statue-like. Her arm-s and head drooped. The saliva and nasal secretion dribbled from her. She dropped her fIeces about, and wet herself as she stood. She never attempted to dress or wash herself. The pulse was 60; te circulation appeared torpid; the nose and lips were purplish; the hands cold anid puffy. At times she would eat, and at times refuLsed food for days together; she had, however, gained flesh. March 9th. She asked voluntarily for some paper, and sat down and wrote a letter to her sister, request ingf her to send her some needlework. The letter was correctly worded and spelt; bnt rather less neatly written towards the close; and it was without signa ture. Great improvement in the appearance of the pa tient took place from this date, and increased. The work was sent, and she took to it at once. 163rd day (or five months). Her expression was greatly improved. She was now quite animated. The 33",

      "abstract": "Depression is a serious mental illness that can be debilitating. It can interfere with daily activities and cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

These entities are usually defined as clusters of symptoms and signs, to which time course and degree of impairment are sometimes added. Such emphasis on an atheoretical phenomenology is aimed at enhancing agreement among clinicians and investigators and is expected to facilitate objective research. The process leading to the formation of clinical features, whether psychodynamic, psychophysiologic, or both, is usually considered to be secondary in diagnostic importance (with the exception of recognizable immediate organic or situational causes), and many times is completely ignored. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the exceptions to the above rule because of the emphasis on the past psychologic trauma as the stressor.

      "abstract": "Abstract Human consciousness, the awareness of oneself and one’s environment, is an artificial construction. In a normal state of consciousness, the brain seamlessly integrates sensory perceptions, emotional states, current thoughts, and past memories. The essential feature of the various dissociative disorders is that these elements have become disrupted, dissociated, from each other. The distinctions between the different types of dissociative disorders are based on which particular aspect of subjective experience has become dissociated from the others. Dissociative amnesia is characterized by dissociation of memory. The affected individual demonstrates an inability to recall important biographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. The memory deficit is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forget-fulness. Dissociative fugue is characterized by an even greater dissociation of memory, such that the individual dissociates not only key historical information but also his own sense of identity. Affected individuals may engage in sudden, unexpected travel away from their homes or customary places of work, accompanied by an inability to recall their past, confusion about their personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity.",

The symptomatology of these various forms of injury is, of course, manifold, but the outstanding symptom and the one usually present and common to all is convulsions. As a matter of fact, however, the rarity with which definite pathologic lesions are proved to exist is in rather striking contrast to the frequency with which convulsions occur. Indeed, it would seem quite probable that the existence of convulsions in whooping cough has frequently been the principal basis on which a diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage, encephalitis or other lesion, has been set up. It is the purpose of this paper to call attention to the fact that infantile tetany, and not anatomic injuries or an unknown toxin, is often the cause of the convulsions",

      "title": "Psychological and Psychosocial Consequences of Combat and Deployment with Special Emphasis on the Gulf War",
      "abstract": "Research in the neurosciences has demonstrated that the boundary between the external world (its events, pressures, concerns and stress) and the brain and body has been broken. The concept of anything being all in the mind is scientifically and intellectually dead. While some data remain ambiguous and direct causal effect cannot be given to stress per se, the overall patterns of research findings demonstrate that stress is a contributing factor to many illnesses, including somatic and psychological symptoms. Therefore, very real consequences attend those who experience prolonged subacute chronic stress, which characterized in the Gulf deployment, combat, and return home. It is feasible that the effects of these stresses made some soldiers more vulnerable to environmental pathogens, both in the theater and at home, than they would otherwise have been. The symptoms of such insults, nested in sociocultural beliefs about illness and the Gulf, might well have amplified deleterious somatic consequences. Like many illnesses, those pertaining to service in the Gulf have been culturally shaped. An illness narrative describes the causes of the illness as perceived by the patient and is most often constructed out of the assertions, metaphors, folklore, causal attributions, and adduced causes common in the patient's culture. Other agents of a presumed authorities, the Internet, and support and self-help groups. Such illness narratives can become an important factor in shaping both the nature and interpretation of symptoms by the patient. A cogent, widespread, and widely shared illness narrative is certainly a characteristic development of Gulf War illness. The threads of combat and deployment stress and the side spectrum of possible responses, as demonstrated throughout history, weaves into the matrix of possible illness causation. It is also possible that a subset of the population is (in some ways, not yet understood) vulnerable and predisposed to injurious responses to the multiple stressors experienced in deployment and combat. This book argues that, to be most helpful to veterans, we must deal with this issue of complexity and not simply focus on a hypothecated or hoped for singular cause of Gulf War illness.",

However, a narrow medicalized view of suffering, solely defined as physical discomfort, ignores or minimizes the broader significance of the suffering experienced by debilitated chronically ill adults. A fundamental form of that suffering is the loss of self in chronically ill persons who observe their former self-images crumbling away without the simultaneous development of equally valued new ones. As a result of their illnesses, these individuals suffer from (1) leading restricted lives, (2) experiencing social isolation, (3) being discredited and (4) burdening others. Each of these four scores of suffering is analysed in relation to its effects on the consciousness of the ill person. The data are drawn from a qualitative study of 57 chronically ill persons with varied diagnoses.",

Особые трудности вызывает дифференциальная диагностика эпилептических и неэпилептических пароксизмальных нарушений ввиду отсутствия абсолютно достоверных клинических маркеров заболевания в межпароксизмальный период, не всегда достаточной информативности инструментальных методов исследования и недостаточной осведомленности врачей. Неэпилептические пароксизмальные нарушения ошибочно диагностируют как эпилепсию в 20–30% случаев даже в медицинских центрах третьего уровня. Ложная положительная диагностика эпилепсии имеет место в 2–71% случаев. Двигательные нарушения, характеризующиеся внезапными преходящими эпизодами патологической непроизвольной двигательной активности, такие как хорея, атетоз, неэпилептические миоклонии, дистония, пароксизмальная дискинезия, нарушение координации произвольных двигательных актов или сочетанные нарушения координации и непроизвольной двигательной активности (пароксизмальная атаксия), представляют значительные диагностические трудности даже для высококвалифицированных специалистов. Нет абсолютно патогномоничных признаков эпилептических и неэпилептических припадков. В статье приведены основные клинические и нейрофизиологические критерии дифференциальной диагностики эпилепсии и ряда двигательных нарушений. Лечебная тактика больных с эпилептическими приступами, которые должны быть дифференцированными с пароксизмальными двигательными нарушениями, имеет ряд особенностей. После установления диагноза «эпилепсия» назначают противоэпилептические препараты широкого спектра действия, не оказывающие негативного влияния на когнитивные функции и не требующие длительного титрования дозы. В таких случаях препаратом выбора может быть леветирацетам, который эффективен при большинстве эпилептических припадков, может эффективно применяться во взрослой и детской практике, не вызывает аггравации припадков, имеет минимальные побочные действия, может быть назначен сразу в терапевтической дозе, кроме того, эффективен при ряде двигательных нарушений и при сочетании эпилепсии с двигательными нарушениями.",

Bien que la morphine et ses dérivés soient reconnus comme les antalgiques de référence dans les douleurs modérées à sévères, des études expérimentales et cliniques montrent clairement que leur administration donne naissance à des hypersensibilités durables à la douleur pouvant conduire au développement de douleurs chroniques. Ces effets ne feraient que mimer ce que font les opioïdes endogènes eux-mêmes lorsqu'ils sont mis en jeu lors de stress environnementaux menaçant la survie de l'individu. Cette hypersensibilité induite par les substances opioïdes exogènes ou endogènes n'est pas limitée à la sensation douloureuse mais rend compte également de la vulnérabilité induite de la sphère émotionnelle comme il en est de l'anxiété par exemple. En raison de mécanismes différents de ceux de la nociception, l'hypersensibilité à la douleur ne peut être réduite par des antalgiques classiques (antinociceptifs) et requiert des thérapies spécifiques dites d'antisensibilisation, telles que les antagonistes NMDA, le protoxyde d'azote, le néfopam ou les régimes alimentaires pauvres en polyamines, capables de moduler négativement (sans les bloquer) les récepteurs NMDA.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia may be described as a disease where speech, bodily language and social responsiveness are obvious expressions of a deteriorated ability to interact with the surroundings in a precise and relevant way. The lack of precision and relevance pertains to perception and recall as well as communication and action. The deficient potential for activation of the prefrontal cerebral cortex is a neurobiological correlate to the lesion of precise and relevant planning and expression. Impairment of formal thought and language in schizophrenia are suggested to result from a developmental disorder pertaining to language and concept formation (apperception). In reactive psychoses with dissociative disturbances of consciousness there is an inefficient capacity for adapting to external reality; thus relevant conscious planning and interaction with the outside world are impaired. Clinically a distractibility of a tematic nature ensues. Except for catastrophic events, psychotic reactions cannot be predicted from analysis of the actual experience--neither concerning the external nor the internal aspects of conscious awareness. Sometimes, however, previous events relating to the formation of the self may add explanatory value to the analysis of reactive psychosis. In some cases biological predisposition is the decisive determinant. The normal discrimination between sense-perception and imagination has a counterpart in the dichotomy of awareness of the outside world versus awareness of the self. The following are examples of psychotic experience where the normal ability for dichotomic discrimination may be damaged: Illusions of affect, hallucinations, Schneider's first rank symptoms, \"Anwesenheit\" and consciousness of time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "The Contribution of Demoralization to End of Life Decisionmaking",
      "abstract": "Some psychiatrists believe that syndrome is a diagnosable cognitive disorder characterized in its extreme form by morbid existential distress. If they are right, then it should be an important part of our thinking about end of life decisionmaking. A demoralized patient would be unable to think reliably about the remainder of her life, and therefore incompetent to decide to commit physician-assisted suicide. The pointlessness of a wretched existence, in which meaning and purpose are lost and despair is pervasive, can lead to a wish to die. This mental state may develop in association with the suffering of the chronically medically ill and of the dying. Should a plea to hasten dying be viewed as a rational request for merciful assistance, or is it symptomatic of a suicidal mind disordered through illness and warranting a therapeutic response? Out of the clinical and ethical debates about end of life decisionmaking, a fundamental question has arisen: is demoralization no more than a comprehensible human and emotional response to a state of dire bodily disease, or can it be a pathological process deserving of diagnosis as illness? In this paper, I explore demoralization as a dimensional state of mind--that is, as a mental state ranging from a normal response to perceived helplessness to a morbid form of existential distress. The impact of demoralization upon a person's capacity to give informed consent across a range of end-of-life decisions is a pivotal question. Demoralization influences a person's assumptive world and may, as I shall show, interfere with his appreciation of clinical data pertinent to decisionmaking. Clinical and legislative implications arise when severe demoralization is recognized as a morbid state of mind. Acceptance of Dying No argument exists concerning the capacity of people to accept rationally the reality of their death. Indeed, sociologists have described this as a quest of the modern palliative care movement: to help patients face their dying with open awareness and courage, the 'ideal' of a heroic death in the supportive care of their family, friends, and community. (1) This acceptance of dying is commonly identifiable within the narrative of many patients, especially the very elderly, as they anticipate what their future might hold. The following clinical account helps to illustrate their mental state. Giuseppe, a married, seventy-five-year-old Italian, suffering from lung cancer and recurrent chest infections, caused his oncologist concern when he expressed a wish to die. He appeared very sad as he spoke of his limited future, his frustration at a considerably restricted exercise tolerance, and the boredom that set in at home. He was the youngest of three children born to a farming family in Northern Italy, his education cut short by the onset of World War II when he was just fourteen. After serving in the army, Giuseppe traveled to France where he married and fathered two daughters. In the 1960s, the family migrated to Australia, where Giuseppe worked as a leading hand in the building industry until retirement a decade ago. He was proud of the respect he had earned for his contribution to the workplace, and especially of his family--the very best! He delighted in completing the crossword puzzle daily. While volunteering an acceptance of his diagnosis, he described waves of sadness that came over him when he thought about his life ending. Yet when conversing more generally, he was interactive, spontaneous, could share a joke, and his mood was dearly reactive to the environmental context. His interest in sport and classical movies sustained his enjoyment of life. There was no hint of a clinical depression. Acknowledging that his health was considerably compromised, he explained that he did not want to go on living with illness. He stated, My chest is no good at all. I don't know about my future. …",

It is the normal response to the distruption of healthy tissues, but its persistence beyond the period of healing should alert the practitioner to other unrecognized causes. On the other hand, learned pain is a condition resulting mainly from socio-emotional factors in the absence of progressive, invasive and, most of the time, demonstrable pathology. The key to success in the management of a painful condition is an accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate intervention and treatment. A complete history and a detailed physical examination, complemented by ancillary laboratory tests and consultations, when necessary, offer the best approach to initial management. This article discusses the pathophysiology of pain, the diagnostic approach and therapeutic interventions for evaluation and management of pain patients. The role of multiple factors as reinforcers of pain behavior deserves careful attention, and a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach may be indicated in selected cases.",

      "abstract": "This particular group of children recovering from tuberculous meningitis have suffered a significant degree of intellectual impairment. It appears that the factor having the most unfavorable influence in intellectual recovery is severe clinical illness as evidenced by convulsive seizures. Loss of consciousness for some time during the early phase of tuberculous meningitis in itself does not appear to be a highly unfavorable sign. Nevertheless, when unconsciousness is associated with convulsive seizures the intellectual functioning of the patient, in most instances, can be expected to be seriously impaired. An infant with tuberculous meningitis may be expected to have an unfavorable prognosis aside from any other factors. An older child, who has remained conscious throughout his illness and without convulsions, may be expected to have a relatively good prognosis. Adverse social factors, prolonged hospitalization and isolation, and sensory-motor sequelae are considered to have influenced unfavorably the psychometric scoring of many of these children. Repeat psychometric testing, after an interval, reveals that still further improvement in intellectual functioning may be expected in a number of these children who do not have serious sensory-motor impairment. For the majority, however, repeat testing reveals that they have varied little from their previous performance; the normal children continuing to develop within their normal group whereas the retarded children have remained retarded. It is noteworthy that observations on five adults treated at the Alexandra Hospital have been at some variance with the observations of Williams and Smith who found no measurable disturbance of intellect, personality or memory in 19 adult patients. Three of the five adults treated in this unit have obvious changes in personality in that they are unable to concentrate as formerly, are easily frustrated, childish and frequently quick-tempered. The remaining two patients appear to have no apparent intellectual or personality sequelae. Although this is a study of a small number of children, it is hoped that other workers will undertake psychometric evaluation of children recovering from tuberculous meningitis and make their results known for comparison.",

In children, the clinical picture of depression differs by syndromologic incompleteness, peculiarity of phenomenological presentations and polymorphism of disorders. In adolescence, depression is characterized by the predominance of behavioral disorders, marked psychopathic-like disorders, suicidal attempts, higher frequency of bipolar forms.

      "abstract": "Most \"organic brain syndromes\" are not difficult to diagnose. However, some \"organic\" states resemble schizophrenia, and this is particularly true of the acute intermittent type of porphyria. Here, the variable pain and paralysis and the prominent psychic changes can easily lead to errors in diagnosis —as recounted in the cases presented—unless this classical triad is kept in mind as being characteristic of porphyria. Early diagnosis would prevent unnecessary surgery and psychotherapy, the administration of drugs which can precipitate an attack, and even commitment as a schizophrenic. It is likely that there are undiagnosed porphyrics in the present mental hospital population of this country; we should therefore routinely do a Watson test on any patient—especially the young female—who is troubled with unusual abdominal pain and any sort of psychic disorder, with or without any concomitant neurological symptoms being present. Little mention has been made of this disease in the past, because it has been thought to be very rare. However, an average of more than one case a year is seen at our 1,000-bed hospital, and it has often been shown in the past that when attention is focused upon supposedly \"rare\" diseases they are found to be much more common than previously supposed.",

      "title": "Depression in Medical Settings",
      "abstract": "Depression is common in people with long-term physical conditions and those seen in medical settings. The actual prevalence varies according to the setting, type and severity of disease, the individual's perception of their condition and premorbid risk factors (e.g. childhood adversity). Depression has a bi-directional causal relationship with physical disease, so each can be a risk factor for the other. Depression and anxiety symptoms co-occur more often than as separate conditions and are often undetected or diagnosed by primary and secondary healthcare staff. People who experience depression and physical illness understand depression as part of their whole life experience and not just as being simply related to their physical health. Depression, and to a lesser extent anxiety, in the context of physical disease are associated with a range of poor outcomes, including poorer physical health outcomes and quality of life; increased hospitalisations, investigations and healthcare costs; and higher mortality.",

      "abstract": "The Masked Depression Syndrome is to be observed in two types which overlap eachother smoothly, i.e. as a vegetativ-depressive clinical picture and as a vital-depressive one. The expression masked depression is not a lucky one. The paper points out that such an expression means a peculiar characteristic of an endo-genic depression in which sadness is not the main symptom of the clinical picture. A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the vitalised chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.",

      "title": "The Nature of Pain in Irritable Bowel Syndrome",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is arbitrary, being based on criteria defined by consensus rather than specific biologic markers. IBS is merely a consortium of symptoms and as presently defined is no more a disease than dyspnea or fatigue are diseases. In this context, it is therefore not surprising that defining the nature of pain has proven elusive. It is often etiologically assumed that the origins of the pain seen in IBS patients are mechanistically distinct from those of some of the other symptoms of IBS such as diarrhea and constipation. In addition pain is assumed to be part of a continuum ranging from complete absence of any pain to varying degrees of discomfort to severe pain. Both of these assumptions should be challenged: there are no data to support the notion that discomfort and pain experienced in IBS are mediated through different pathways than symptoms such as bloating or that they are not merely the consequence of the physiological perturbations associated with altered bowel function. Similarly one can easily argue that visceral pain may actually be the cause rather than the effect of the altered gut function seen in IBS. Abdominal discomfort could then be the consequence of the latter and be only indirectly related to pain. It is likely that central (such as stress) and peripheral factors (such as intestinal infection) will produce similar symptoms but via markedly different pathways. It may be time to deconstruct IBS as a concept and to approach the clinical picture from a mechanistic rather than a phenomenological perspective, particularly if we are interested in understanding the basis of the symptoms and develop effective therapeutic modalities. Our patients deserve no less.",

      "title": "SOMATOTYPES IN RELATION TO DEMENTIA PRÆCOX",
      "abstract": "The empirical finding of the present study can be stated simply enough : mental patients who have died of other causes than exhaustive diseases include in their number a strikingly large proportion of persons with long, lean, wiry, not merely ectomorphic but to some extent mesomorphic physiques, and a conspicuous lack of those with big-boned, heavily muscled builds. They form a relatively homogeneous group, differing not at all by the nature of their mental illnesses, whether functional or organic in origin : but those who were older at the time of their deaths tend to be bulkier, more rounded, and less thin and fragile than those who died at early ages. To explain these facts is still difficult. Perhaps the patients really differed from an unselected population in these respects before the onset of their illnesses, in which case, one would be led to a hypothesis of a constitutional make-up with nonspecific vulnerability to psychosis. Very probably, the bodily build is not the result of the mental illness, directly or indirectly; if it were, one would expect the effects to show more sharply in cases where the disorder was of long duration. It does not seem plausible that faulty technique on the part of the investigators could have produced such consistent results if readily apparent differences between nosological groups did exist. Possibly mesomorphy is less apparent in a person who is suspended in mid-air instead of standing up, and dead—without muscular tonus—instead of alive; other bias introduced by the fact of death seems less probable, since there were a number of suicides and accidental deaths and none after an exhaustive, lingering illness. It is possible also that some of the differences between our subjects and Sheldon's are attributable to lack of representativeness in his sample as well as in ours. If it is also true that somatotypes change with age, another reason for not using Sheldon's norms as a standard might be found, though such a hypothesis would make the results even harder to explain. The group which is most comparable in age with the 4,000 college students is the very one which is least like them, while advancing age puts enough flesh on these skinny patients to make them appear (perhaps speciously) more like the standardization group. It is credible that American men as a group are not as athletic in their physiques as young college men, but it is very hard to believe that they are as scrawny as the majority of our research population. The general finding of a specific excess and deficit of just two kinds of builds, making up a total of only 35.5% of Sheldon's group, is thus hard to explain away on the basis of sampling error. A possibility which does still remain is that one of these groups—the mesomorphic ectomorphs—is simply less viable, while the other—the predominant mesomorphs and ectomorphic mesomorphs—has greater vitality. It would be easy to test this hypothesis by somatotyping a similar group of patients dying successively in a general hospital, using the same sampling controls as the ones we employed. If significant differences between such a group and ours were still found, it would be possible to say with some confidence that the peculiarities of somatotype were specific to mental illness. In The Varieties of Human Physique, Sheldon has already hedged a little against the possibility of largely negative findings such as the ones presented here, by stating that certain kinds of dysplasia are much more closely related to dementia præcox than are particular somatotypes. The analysis of dysplasia, or disharmony between various regions of the body, requires an additional five sets of judgments for each picture; we decided to forego it. The possibility still remains, then, that more refined and exhaustive somatotyping studies (and we may add, much more time-consuming ones), might bear fruit of positive results if oriented toward the analysis of dysplasia. The difficulties which have plagued this study point dearly to one conclusion: the mere adoption of the technique of somatotyping opens up no royal road to the relationship between physique and psychosis. As it presently stands, the system is not well adapted to application to the very types of research problems to which it seems to have so much to contribute. To have studied with the originator of the technique and to have tried conscientiously to follow the book is not enough to enable one to apply it to subjects who differ appreciably from those Sheldon used and end up confident that the results are not a function of errors in method. Until normative studies have been done upon satisfactory samples of older men, and of women, somatotyping studies will perforce be limited to populations of white college men or others who are similar in sex, ethnic group, and age. Within these limitations, it is still possible to design a study which can result in conclusive findings where we have tried to pioneer. The research population should be a complete or a random sample of hospitalized patients, all physically healthy white males between 18 and 25 years old. They should be somatotyped independently by two or more observers who have no knowledge of the patients or their diagnoses, preferably using the anthropometric technique or at least validating anthroposcopic judgments by measurements and reference to the tables in Sheldon's book in a considerable sub-sample. Groups should be equated for length of hospitalization and for duration of illness. Diagnoses should be clearly and of course independently established, if possible by the use of psychological tests as well as clinical examination. Finally, the data should be analyzed from the standpoint of mean ratings, groups of somatotypes, and kinds and degree of dysplasia. Such a study, which would not be prohibitively difficult to carry out, would furnish the conclusive data which are so badly needed on the relationship between mental disease and physique.",

      "title": "The role of the nurse in the assessment and treatment of pain in oncological patients",
      "abstract": "Nowadays, pain along with respiratory rate, body temperature, hart rate, arterial blood pressure breathing, temperature, pulse and pressure is considered the fifth vital sign. It is often stated that the pain is the most common symptom in clinical practice, a frequent cause of functional impairment of individual inability to function in a normal way, and the most common reason for seeking medical help. In patients who suffer from a long-term feeling of intense pain, efficiency and working ability are reduced and their emotional state is damaged as well. Due to long-term treatment and damaged everyday functioning, these patients often find themselves as social and financial issues. Knowledge about pain goes back far into the history of medical science and says that pain is a symptom of disease and will disappear when the underlying disease is cured. Nowadays, especially the chronic pain is identified as an independent health issue that can and must be treated. The pain is not only the transmission of impulses from the place of injury to the perception area of the brain but a phenomenon that is influenced by factors quantitative, qualitative and sensory, as well as cultural, social and economic. In addition to physical damage, the combination of psychological, social and spiritual component leads us to the concept of total pain definition. Therefore, it is necessary to act to all these causes for complete pain relief. Pain is an important public health issue worldwide. Despite the tremendous progress of science with new technological discoveries and pharmacological agents, pain is still a worldwide problem. It is a basic human right to live without pain, which means that the health care system is responsible to provide help to anyone who feels pain.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is still a real mental health problem; although most epilepsies are curable, their psychopathological consequences are often significant and complex to manage. In this framework, the association of epilepsy with psychotic disorders has long been known.To discuss the links between epilepsy and psychosis, we report the observation of a 52-year-old man, treated for complex focal epilepsy, admitted to a psychiatric department for auditory and visual hallucinations and a behavioural disorder not improved by antiepileptic treatment alone or an antipsychotic alone.Psychotic symptoms in epilepsy can be part of intercritical, post-critical or alternative psychoses. In our patient's case, the psychotic symptoms were post-critical and alternative. It was probably an associated schizophreniform disorder. Emotional indifference and activity restriction are rarely encountered in this setting, while rapid mood fluctuations are frequent. Delusional themes are often mystical, fueled by auditory and unusual visual hallucinations. Negative disorders are rare.Epileptic psychoses have not been identified as nosographic entities in the psychiatric classification systems (DSM-V and ICD-10), which poses a problem in recognizing these disorders. Therefore, a collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists is necessary to understand this complex comorbidity better, avoid diagnostic errors, and optimize management.",

Για την τάση σωματοποίησης οι αντίστοιχοι δείκτες είχαν ως εξής IRR: 4.8;95%CI: 3.6-6.4 για τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων με συχνή εμφάνιση και IRR: 5.5; 95%CI:4.2-7.2για τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων πόνου με συνοδό αναπηρία. H αντίληψη ότι ο μυοσκελετικόςπόνος προκαλείται από την εργασία είχε επίσης θετική συσχέτιση με τον αριθμόεντοπίσεων του πόνου (IRR: 1.7; 95%CI: 1.3-2.2 για τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων με συχνήεμφάνιση, IRR: 1.5; 95%CI:1.2-2.0 για τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων πόνου με συνοδόαναπηρία. Η ικανοποίηση από την εργασία και η υποστήριξη των συναδέλφων ή/καιτου προϊσταμένου είχαν αρνητική συσχέτιση με τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων του πόνου (ΙRR:0.6; 95%CI:0.5-0.8 και IRR:0.7; 95%CI:0.5-0.8 αντίστοιχα). Η γκρίζα ζώνη τηςαλεξιθυμίας είχε αρνητική σχέση με τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων του πόνου (IRR:0.6;95%CI:0.4-0.9), δίνοντας στοιχεία υπέρ μιας σχέσης δόσης απόκρισης πουαντιπροσωπεύεται από μια καμπύλη σε σχήμα «U». H CART ανάλυση κατέδειξε τηντάση για σωματοποίηση ως τον πιο καθοριστικό παράγοντα, για την εμφάνιση σε έναάτομο πόνο με μεγάλο αριθμό εντοπίσεων.Η τάση για σωματοποίηση φάνηκε να έχει επίσης ρόλο συγχυτικού παράγοντα στησχέση μεταξύ α. σωματικής επιβάρυνσης και β. ψυχοκοινωνικών χαρακτηριστικών τηςεργασίας και σε δύο σκορ που περιγράφουν την επιβάρυνση του ατόμου από τηνοσφυαλγία.Οι περισσότερες από 40 ώρες την εβδομάδα εργασίας φάνηκε να είναι ένας παράγονταςπου σχετίζεται με το νεοεμφανιζόμενο πόνο πολλαπλής εντόπισης (OR: 5.0, 95%CI:1.1-24.0), ενώ η βαριά σωματική καταπόνηση κατά την εργασία (OR:5.1, 95%CI:2.1-12.2), ημεγάλη τάση σωματοποίησης (OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.9-5.5) , η πεσμένη διάθεση (OR: 1.8, 95%CI: 1.0-3.2), το σκορ για τη νευρωτική διάσταση της προσωπικότητας (Coeff: 1.05, pvalue:0.05) και η αντίληψη οτι ο πόνος οφείλεται στην εργασία (ΟR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3-3.8), εμφανίστηκαν ως επιβαρυντικοί παράγοντες για την εμφάνιση εμμένοντοςμυοσκελετικού πόνου πολλαπλής εντόπισης ένα χρόνο αργότερα.Συμπέρασμα Ο μυοσκελετικός πόνος με μονήρη εντόπιση ήταν συχνός στο δείγμαπου μελετήθηκε, ενώ ο πόνος πολλαπλής εντόπισης ήταν ακόμη συχνότερος.

It is often under-recognized in clinical practice and greatly under-researched topic in academic psychiatry. Nonadherence to mood stabilizers is in part due to the adverse effects and it is more likely due to certain adverse effects such as weight gain, tremor, and cognitive impairment. Practicing psychiatrists can potentially reduce the nonadherence by vigorous attempts to identify, discuss, and ameliorate these adverse effects.",

Conclusion:Concussion and its sequelae are still contestable, not only due to the lack of specificity, availability of studies and gold-standard biomarkers, but also due to its subjective nature in diagnosis, and its significant overlap with other physical, neurological and psychiatric conditions.",

No es tampoco un fenomeno unitario ya que engloba diferentes manifestaciones de dificultades lectoras asociadas a distintas disfunciones neuropsicologicas. Entre las hipotesis que se barajan en la literatura cientifica, las mas populares hacen referencia a la existencia de un deficit en el procesamiento fonologico o conciencia fonologica que consiste en una incapacidad para segmentar el flujo del habla en sus constituyentes sonoros. Todavia no se conoce con exactitud el origen de este problema aunque se han planteado dos hipotesis:\nA,- El deficit es producido por una disfuncion en un sistema especifico para el habla.\nB,- El deficit es producido por una deficiencia auditiva mas general caracterizada por una dificultad para discriminar estimulos que cambian rapidamente de frecuencias.\nEsta ultima hipotesis ha sido denominada hipotesis del procesamiento temporal.\nOtro tipo de teorias hacen referencia a la existencia de dificultades en el procesamiento visual tanto a un nivel de procesos basicos, que se encuentran relacionados con la via magnocelular encargada de procesar las imagenes en movimiento durante la lectura, como de procesos superiores asociados al procesamiento ortografico o visuoespecial. En este sentido, el modelo de deficit de Symour (1997) se constituye como un modelo valido y parsimonioso que permite integrar las diferentes hipotesis mencionadas dentro de un modelo cognitivo de la lectura.\nUna de las tecnicas utilizadas en el estudio de la dislexia es la tecnica de potenciales cerebrales relacionados con eventos que consiste en el registro de la actividad cerebral debida a un proceso cognitivos inducidos por la realizacion de una d",

In some cases, the content of the psychosis could be partly traced to earlier factors in the patient's lives. The clouded states were compared to alcoholic pathological intoxication.

However, the authors' review of recent long-term follow-up studies and of the clinical experiences of early researchers strongly challenges this pervasive expectation. This report suggests that there is considerable heterogeneity in the long-term outcome of schizophrenia, with marginal or deteriorated states more the exception than the rule. Among the contributors to the misperception of chronicity are biased sampling, both past and present, as well as a multitude of environmental and psychosocial factors that affect patient outcome.",

      "title": "Comparison of auditory hallucinations across different disorders and syndromes",
      "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations can be experienced in the context of many different disorders and syndromes. The differential diagnosis basically rests on the presence or absence of accompanying symptoms. In terms of clinical relevance, the most important distinction to be made is between auditory hallucinations occurring in the context of psychotic disorders and those that are due to a somatic disorder. Auditory hallucinations are also quite common in otherwise healthy individuals and are therefore not necessarily disease-related. As auditory hallucinations are often accompanied by hallucinations in other modalities, pinpointing the modality in which hallucinations are experienced most frequently may provide a first – albeit coarse – indication of whether the auditory hallucinations are part of a neurological disorder (mainly visual), a psychiatric disorder (mainly auditory), an ear disorder (mainly auditory) or whether they occur in the absence of any disorder (mainly auditory). Epilepsy is the most important exception to this coarse differentiation. Another traditional distinction between hallucinations occurring in the context of neurological and psychiatric disorders is that the former are assumed to start at an advanced age, whereas hallucinations in the context of psychiatric disorders typically begin in late adolescence or early adulthood. Although there are many exceptions to this rule of thumb – as in psychotic depression, late-onset schizophrenia and epilepsy – age of onset can still be a valuable clinical indicator. The content of auditory hallucinations is notoriously unreliable for differential diagnosis and the safest way to an accurate diagnosis rests with the detection of psychiatric and somatic comorbid symptoms.",

It discusses recent neuroimaging studies providing fresh insights into the condition and opening up new opportunities to manage the symptoms with pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions.

      "abstract": "Abstract The terms subjective and objective often appear in health care records, and one commonly hears about “subjective symptoms” and “objective complaints”—yet the former is redundant and the latter an oxymoron. Objectively verifiable pathology may explain a patient's symptoms, but complaints themselves are never objective but rather, by definition, subjective. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, defines the terminology: Subjective information is more open to interpretation, but objective data are factual, reproducible, and often measurable or quantifiable. Objective findings generally have much higher inter-examiner reliability than subjective findings. Symptoms and most findings on physical (particularly neuromusculoskeletal) examination are subjective. Diagnostic study results and a minority of physical findings are objective. Some physical findings, such as strength and range of motion measurements, are both subjective and objective. Repeat testing, assessment of plausibility, and use of confirmatory physical findings can be used to validate or “objectify” subjective findings (eg, by determining if a weakness is corroborated by other neurologic or physical findings, imaging study results, and/or electrodiagnostic testing). The use of objective, or at least less subjective, findings in impairment rating should improve interrater reliability. Thus, evaluating physicians should not regard subjective complaints and findings, and they should lend greater weight to objective findings.",

The necessity to act, and the urgency of the act in adolescence has been observed as well in adolescents that have health problems as in adolescents in good health. It is not possible to separate the acts that are symptoms of a pathological organization from the acts that are an expression of a normal psychology, but there is a tendency to conceive as psychopathological that which comes into conflict with, and that which is a transgression to, the laws of the social environment, and the biological laws. It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

Most importantly, it can shed light on the normal organization of the relations of consciousness to its functions and on its normal course of development. In this sense, the psychological study of schizophrenia perhaps contains the key to understanding the structure of normal consciousness. In any case, the psychological study of schizophrenia, which has not yet advanced very far, should enable us to approach normal human consciousness from the standpoint of a psychological laboratory experiment.",

Sleep is divided into rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep. Human sleep needs vary by age and among individuals and sleep is considered to be adequate when there is no daytime sleepiness or dysfunction. Disruption of sleep can be caused by a variety of causes. Sleep disorders may be serious enough to interfere with normal physical, mental and emotional functioning. Management of sleep disorders includes behavioral and psychotherapeutic treatment, rehabilitation and management, medications and other somatic treatment.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety and psychosomatic Desease. Escalation mechanisms and therapeutic strategies from the perspective of systems theory and behavioral therapy Abstract. There is unlikely to be a symptomatic malady or disease in humans that is not accompanied by more or less severe anxiety. This can directly negatively influence bodily disease processes, it always creates or intensifies mental suffering, often it causes the development of an independent anxiety disorder. Pathogenetically, nonlinear amplifications play a central role, as they are typical for complex dynamic systems. While these multiple vicious cycle mechanisms are responsible for the escalation of symptoms, misdirected learning processes bring about a chronification. An integrative model for these pathogenetic relationships is being developed, which at the same time makes it clear how one can synergistically combine established behavioral therapy methods for their treatment. This integrative behavioral therapy is exemplified by a case study.Zusammenfassung. Es dürfte kaum eine symptomatische Funktionsstörung oder Erkrankung geben, die beim Menschen nicht von mehr oder weniger starker Angst begleitet wird. Dies kann körperliche Krankheitsprozesse direkt negativ beeinflussen, immer erzeugt bzw. intensiviert es psychisches Leiden, oft verselbständigt es sich zu einer eigenständigen Angsterkrankung. Pathogenetisch spielen nichtlineare Verstärkungen eine zentrale Rolle, wie sie für Komplexe dynamische Systeme typisch sind. Während diese vielfältigen Teufelskreis-Mechanismen für die Eskalation der Symptome verantwortlich sind, bewirken fehlgeleitete Lernprozesse eine Chronifzierung. Es wird ein Integrierendes Modell für diese pathogenetischen Zusammenhänge entwickelt, das zugleich deutlich macht, wie man etablierte verhaltenstherapeutische Methoden zu ihrer Behandlung synergistisch kombinieren kann. Diese verfahrensintegrierende Verhaltenstherapie wird an einem Fallbeispiel exemplifiziert.",

Cerebrovascular diseases cause a high percentage of disability and mortality among the population. Stroke, by importance and frequency, ranks first in neurological diseases, and third in mortality after cardiovascular and malignant diseases. Disability of survivors is up to 50%. Hemiplegia is а complete paralysis on one side of the body, crosswise to the damaged side of the brain hemisphere. Most common reason for hemiplegia is stroke. General symptoms include vomiting, headache, loss of consciousness up to coma, meningitic syndrome. Clinical picture of hemiplegia is develops through several stages. First stage is flaccid or and lasts 10-14 days. The second stage is chronic or spastic and happens at 2-3rd week after the stroke. The cerebrovascular stroke is diagnosed by obtaining a medical history in which dominates longlasting headache, loss of consciousness and high blood pressure. Another method of diagnose is CT. On the other hand, MRI is sensitive and selective method. It can detect vascular malformation (aneurysm). The rehabilitation should start as soon as possible in order to prevent: contractures, decubitus or other skin damage. Depending of the patients improving,we start improving the quality of daily activities: dressing, using phone feeding, personal hygiene etc. Therefore, the role of the physiotherapist in hemiplegic patient’s life is very important because he has to work with the patient completely dedicated from the earliest to the final stage of the rehabilitation.",

Like the somnambulist, the person may seem to realize his surroundings and be conscious of his acts, and later be unable to recall anything which has happened.

Nerves injuries are caused by car and labor accidents, by cutting and penetrating objects, crushing, fractures, stretching and gunshot wound, professional or amateur sportsmen injuries. Chronic post-surgical pain is a major clinical problem. Incidence of chronic post-surgical pain varies depending on the type of surgery and surgical technique – after limb amputation, thoracotomy, mastectomy, hysterectomy, hip arthroplasty, cholecystectomy, colectomy, vasectomy, Cesarean section. Such pain can transform into persistent, severe and refractory chronic neuropathic pain, which is a serious social problem because it often affects the most productive population, sometimes causing disability, have a high level of comorbidity in the form of psychopathological conditions, sleep disorders. The pathophysiology and neurotransmission of neuropathic pain have complex and not fully understood mechanisms. They involve produce local and systemic signal pain cytokines, disturbances in the modulation of sensory flows, peripheral and central sensitization, neurotransmitter imbalance, changes in gene expression and implicate of the limbic system and hypothalamus contribute to the modulation of mood and behavior. Options for managing neuropathic pain with nerve damage include a limited number of pharmacological drugs and interventional treatment methods. Main drugs used in relief in neuropathic pain include tricyclics antidepressants and dual norepinephrine/5 hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids – gabapentin and pregabalin, capsaicin, opioid analgesics, especially tramadol and methadone are recommended as second line drugs.

Objective To review and update the clinical characteristics, etiologies, pathophysiology and management of these headaches related to exertion. Methods In depth review of the publications, both in PubMed and in the main textbooks, of the different headaches induced by physical exercise. Results Cough, exercise and sexual headaches can be primary or secondary; therefore, complementary studies are mandatory to rule out structural lesions. However, clinical characteristics, such as an old age and response to indomethacin for cough headache or being a young male and response to beta-blockers for exercise and sexual headaches, plus a normal examination are suggestive of a primary etiology. Etiology for secondary varieties, as posterior fossa lesions for cough headache or vascular malformations for exercise and sexual headaches, are also different. Finally, headache as a distant manifestation of myocardial ischemia, also known as “cardiac cephalalgia”, appears at exertion in around two-thirds of cases and typically lasts less than 30 minutes and is relieved by nitroglycerine. Conclusions Primary and secondary cough headache can usually be suspected based on clinical characteristics and separated from exercise and sexual headaches, which share many aspects. Cardiac cephalalgia is not necessarily an exertional headache and should be considered in adult patients with short lasting headaches and patent vascular risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Stress is defined as any intrinsic or exogenous stimulus that causes a biological response. Stress reactions are the compensating responses to various pressures. Stress can have a variety of impacts on the body, ranging from changes in homeostasis to life-threatening effects and death, depending on the nature, timing, and severity of the applied stimulus. Pathophysiological complications are common in many situations. People who work or live in stressful circumstances, for example, are more likely to develop a variety of diseases. Many diseases and pathological situations are made worse by stress, which can be a triggering or aggravating factor. We looked at some of the major consequences of stress on humans’ primary physiological systems in this study [1].",

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

Few studies have investigated public attitudes towards distinguishing normal from pathological grief. An international sample of 348 participants from a wide range of cultures was asked if certain expressions of grief could be considered a mental disorder and to explain their answer. Analysis revealed that the majority (74.7%) agreed that grief could be considered a mental disorder. The presence of pervasive distress, of harm to self and/or others, functional impairment, and persistent grief were described as the circumstances under which grief can be a mental disorder. Reasons grief is not a mental disorder were that it is normal, temporary, in response to an event, and that efforts to include it in diagnostic manuals will lead to medicalization and stigma. The investigation of public norms informs the inclusion of pathological grief in diagnostic nosology.",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

Predisposing factors are a history of sexual or physical abuse, psychiatric disorders, previous episodes of functional coma, and recent surgery with general anesthesia. Several clinical signs are suggestive for the diagnosis, however none of them is sufficiently sensitive or specific. Therefore, functional coma remains an exclusion diagnosis. Vital signs must be normal, just as a routine blood examination, an electroencephalogram and imaging of the central nervous system.

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

The complications of occupational exposure to neurotoxins and putative neurotoxins are also covered in so far as they relate to the fitness of an exposed employee to continue working. In addition to a few well-known and common conditions, many uncommon but distinct neurological disorders may present at work or affect work capacity. Fitness for work in these disorders will be determined by the person’s functional abilities, any co-morbid illness, the efficacy or side effects of the treatment, and psychological and social factors, rather than by the precise diagnosis. This will also need to be put into the context of the job in question, as the basic requirements for a manual labouring job may be completely different from something more intellectually demanding. Indeed, even an apparently precise diagnostic label such as multiple sclerosis can encompass a complete spectrum of disability, from someone who is entirely asymptomatic to another who is totally incapacitated. Furthermore, reports by general practitioners, neurologists, or neurosurgeons may describe the symptoms, signs, and investigations in detail, but without analysing functional abilities. These colleagues may also fail to appreciate the workplace hazards, the responsibilities of the employer, or what scope exists for adaptations to the job or workplace.",

      "title": "The Development of Illness Anxiety Disorder in a Patient After Partial Thyroidectomy",
      "abstract": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), characterises illness anxiety disorder (IAD) as the preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness in the absence of somatic symptoms (or, if present, symptoms that are only mild in severity). DSM-5 includes illness anxiety disorder in the category called somatic symptom and related disorders, characterised by prominent somatic concerns, distress, and impaired functioning. More often than in psychiatric settings, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are encountered in primary care and specialist medical settings. Despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and adequate reassurances from specialists, their conviction of being ill persists. Illness anxiety preoccupations are heterogeneous, and the degree of insight is variable. Their illness-related preoccupation interferes with their relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. They are frequently addicted to internet searches about their feared illness, inferring the worst from the information (or false information) they uncover. Patients with illness anxiety disorder often have comorbid psychopathology, especially anxiety and depressive disorders. Typically, illness anxiety disorder is chronic. Physical symptoms are absent or mild and frequently represent a misinterpretation of normal bodily sensations. This case report presents the case of a patient diagnosed with IAD by a psychiatrist. The patient had been seen by his primary care physician and therapist for three years without any improvement in his symptoms before he was referred to a psychiatrist. After undergoing a partial thyroidectomy in 2018, this patient has been experiencing increasing symptoms of recurrent anxiety/fear consistent with IAD, despite extensive medical examinations that have consistently revealed normal results.",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden onset of psychosis in a patient for a duration of more than a day and less than a month. The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor. In this case report, we present a fifteen-year-old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

      "title": "Key Facts About Tinnitus",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there is no external sound present, often described as a ringing, buzzing, humming, clicking, or cicada-like sound. Less commonly, tinnitus can be heard as a musical tune or a pulsing sound in time with a person's heartbeat. It may be one or multiple sounds, and it may be constant or intermittent. It can be heard as coming from one or both ears or from within the head. Research shows that most people hear tinnitus when they are asked to listen in a very quiet environment (i.e., when sitting in a sound-proof booth). Tinnitus is common and reported in all age groups. CAUSE AND HABITUATION The exact cause of tinnitus is hard to pinpoint, but it is generally understood that it results from some type of change, either mental or physical, but not necessarily related to the ear. Tinnitus can be associated with noise exposure, hearing loss, middle ear pathology or dysfunction, impacted wax, head or neck injuries, some medications, or a period of high stress. In many instances, the cause or the trigger is unknown. Tinnitus may dissipate over time or a person may habituate to it such that even though it may be audible, it is of little consequence. In some people, the tinnitus can be intrusively bothersome and significantly affect their general well-being. Seek assistance if the tinnitus: is associated with hearing difficulties. presents or changes suddenly. becomes intrusive and bothersome. interferes with sleep and/or your ability to concentrate. impacts general well-being. is in one ear only. Individuals with tinnitus are often told that “there is nothing that can be done” or that “you will have to learn to live with it,” but this is not the case. While there is no cure, treatment options are available, and patients can successfully manage the tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a concern. Consult a general practitioner to address any underlying medical factor that may be contributing to the tinnitus. Some people require a more involved intervention, and those with distressing tinnitus often benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. In addition to a general practitioner, an ENT specialist, and an audiologist/a tinnitus specialist, others who may be involved in the rehabilitation process include physiotherapists, counsellors, sleep specialists, and/or temporomandibular joint dental specialists. Factors influencing your ability to get used to the tinnitus include current stress levels and coping abilities, emotional and physical support systems, and insight into the mechanisms of the tinnitus. Plus, understanding how all of the above interact. FINDING SUPPORT Your experience of tinnitus and its impact on your life are unique, so it's important to seek the assistance of a tinnitus specialist who can offer a holistic, evidence-based tinnitus program designed specifically for your personal situation. A tinnitus management program should provide you with a deeper understanding of tinnitus and strategies you can use to manage and reduce the symptoms. These strategies may include a combination of: sound enrichment hearing devices neuromonics treatment behavioral techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance commitment therapy stress reduction and relaxation strategies sleep solutions TINNITUS AND HEARING If the tinnitus is accompanied by any hearing loss, the use of hearing aids can be helpful on a number of levels. Well-fitted hearing aids assist with communication, help reduce the stress and fatigue associated with intensive listening, and amplify low-level background sound. This can result in a reduction in tinnitus awareness. There are also devices that combine a hearing aid and a noise generator in a single unit, and these can provide the benefits of both. The timing and sequence of different types of intervention can play an important role in how individuals respond to treatment. A person with chronic tinnitus may be grieving for the perceived loss of silence and how this is affecting his or her life. This person may not be ready for certain types of intervention (e.g., hearing aids, maskers), and may even reject any early intervention. Before the rehabilitation process begins, it is helpful for the individual to be in a place of acceptance and to start coping emotionally.

      "title": "How Anxiety Presents Differently in Older Adults: Age-Related Changes, Medical Comorbidities Alter Presentation and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Although anxiety disorders are common at all ages, there is a misconception that their prevalence drastically declines with age. For this reason anxiety disorders often are underdiagnosed and undertreated in geriatric patients, especially when the clinical presentation of these disorders in older patients differs from that seen in younger adults. In older persons, anxiety symptoms often overlap with medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism and geriatric patients tend to express anxiety symptoms as medical or somatic problems such as pain rather than as psychological distress. 1 As a result, older adults often seek treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms from their primary care physician instead of a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, primary care physicians often miss psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders, in geriatric patients. Anxiety may be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric disturbance, secondary to a general medical condition, or induced by dietary substances, substances of abuse, or medications. Late-life anxiety often is comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Box, page 66) and other psychological stressors as older adults recognize declining cognitive and physical functioning. (2) BOX Comorbid anxiety and depression: Highly prevalent, poorer outcomes The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam study--one of the largest epidemiologic studies to examine comorbidity of anxiety disorders and depression in patients age 55 to 85--found that 48% of older persons with primary major depressive disorder (MDD) also had a comorbid anxiety disorder, whereas approximately one-fourth of those with anxiety disorders also had MDD. (a) Pre-existing anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder, increase the risk of developing depression. Rates of comorbid anxiety and depression increase with age. (c) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Late-life MDD comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder is associated with greater memory decline than MDD alone. (d) In addition, comorbid anxiety and depression is associated with greater symptom severity and persistence, greater functional impairment, substance dependence, poorer compliance and response to treatment, worse overall prognosis and outcome than patients with either disorder alone, (e) and greater likelihood of suicidal ideation in older men. (f) Source: For reference citations, see this article at CurrentPsychiatry.com Anxiety disorders commonly begin in early adulthood, tend to be chronic and interspersed with remissions and relapses, and usually continue into old age. (3) In generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), there is a bimodal distribution of onset; approximately two-thirds of patients experience onset between the late teens and late 20s and one-third develop the disorder for the first time after age 50. (3) Prevalence rates for anxiety disorders among older adults (age >55) range from 3.5% to 10.2%.(4) These rates are slightly lower than those for younger adults. (5) Among older adults, presence of a 12-month anxiety disorder was associated with female sex, lower education, being unmarried, and having [grater than or equal to]3 or more chronic conditions. (6) Anxiety and disability risk Anxiety disorders affect geriatric patients more profoundly than their younger counterparts. Persons age >65 who have an anxiety disorder are 3 to 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than younger individuals. (1) Anxiety is associated with high rates of medically unexplained symptoms, increased use of health care resources, chronic medical illness, low levels of physical health-related quality of life, and physical disability. (7), (8) Anxiety symptoms may predict progressing physical disability among older women and reduced ability to perform activities of daily living over 1 year. …",

      "abstract": "Objective The purpose of this paper was to review the current state of evidence for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in retired athletes and to consider the potential differential diagnoses that require consideration when retired athletes present with cognitive and psychiatric problems. Data sources MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Mosby's Index, PsycEXTRA, PsycINFO and Scopus. Key words included CTE, dementia pugilistica, punch drunk syndrome, traumatic encephalopathy, CTE, repetitive head injury, sports concussion, multiple concussions, chronic concussions, subconcussive blow and sports-related traumatic brain injury. Results At present, there are no published epidemiological, cross-sectional or prospective studies relating to modern CTE. Owing to the nature of the published studies, being case reports or pathological case series, it is not possible to determine the causality or risk factors with any certainty. As such, the speculation that repeated concussion or subconcussive impacts cause CTE remains unproven. The extent to which age-related changes, psychiatric or mental health illness, alcohol/drug use or coexisting dementing illnesses contribute to this process is largely unaccounted for in the published literature. Conclusions At present, the interpretation of causation in the modern CTE case studies should proceed cautiously. The causal assumptions require further prospective or longitudinal studies on the topic.",

Psychosomatic factors should be given special attention during interviews. For a correct picture to be obtained, the help of a specially trained worker i.e. a psychiatrist or psychologist, should be enlisted. Factors and casual relationships can then be uncovered which remain problems to doctors not thus specialized. The two series dealt with in this study illustrate this clearly. Summarizing the observations made, Menière patients subjected to careful psychic and somatic analysis are found to have a predisposing psychosomatic constitution which, under chronic or acute stress, leads to such somatic manifestations as, in their turn, seem to presuppose a certain somatic predisposition—in this particular case evidently in the ear. Chronic stress seems to impair prognosis, a fact not difficult to understand considering that the mode of reaction depends upon the constitution, which—obviously—is of fairly permanent nature.",

      "abstract": "sevoflurane. Agitation is a state of mild restlessness and mental distress. Agitation can arise from any number of sources, including pain, physiological compromise, or anxiety [2]. Sikich and Lerman [3] defined emergence delirium as “a disturbance in a child’s awareness of and attention to his/her environment with disorientation and perceptual alterations, including hypersensitivity to stimuli and hyperactive motor behavior in the immediate postanesthesia period.” Emergence agitation and emergence delirium have been used interchangeably in most of the literature. Despite numerous attempts to explain the causes of emergence agitation/delirium, there is no definitive explanation. Possible causes include pain, preoperative anxiety, type of surgical procedures, personal characteristics of the patient, and type of anesthetics, although no sole factor can explain the etiology of emergence agitation/delirium [4], in large part due to the greatest obstacle to understanding emergence agitation/delirium is the lack of a standardized tool to assess it. The reported prevalence of emergence agitation/delirium varies greatly in the literature, ranging from 10% to 80% [5,6], depending on the definition and criteria of emergence agitation/delirium. Sikich and Lerman [3] recently developed the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale,",

      "title": "Toward a Dimensional Understanding of Psychosis and Its Treatment",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a mental state characterized by a set of perceptual, thought disorder, and cognitive symptoms and constructs that manifest themselves in several psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, but also in some neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, and in some medical diseases, especially endocrinological and metabolic conditions. Psychotic symptoms are characterized by a combination of hallucinatory experiences, delusional interpretations of reality, and frank thought disorder, often accompanied by thought and behavior disorganization. Psychotic symptoms are experienced by individuals as real cognitive and sensory occurrences and involve all sensory modalities (auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile). The most characteristic experience of psychosis is \"loss of reality,\" which represents the psychotic individual's unquestioned perception that his or her symptoms are real occurrences and not pathological mental constructs; this experience occurs particularly in psychiatric psychotic syndromes. The World Health Organization's International Psychosis Study (Carpenter et al. 1973) investigated whether psychotic symptoms vary around the world in different cultures and regions by examining psychosis in individuals across seven countries; the conclusion was that psychotic symptomatology spans continents, languages, and cultures with great similarity, albeit with great interindividual variability. Several first-person accounts written by brilliant and self-perceptive individuals with psychosis record the nature of psychosis and illustrate the profound loss of reality testing around psychotic experiences. John Nash described the nature of his delusion:These ideas just keep coming into my head. I can't prevent it. [I] believe that there is a conspiracy among military leaders to take over the world, and that [I] am in charge of the takeover. [I] secretly feel that I am the left foot of God. And that God is walking on the earth. (qtd. in Nasar 1998, p. 234)Elyn Saks (2007) detailed her experience of psychotic \"disorientation\" as follows:Consciousness gradually loses its coherence. The \"me\" becomes a haze. . reality breaks up like a bad radio signal. There is no longer a sturdy vantage point from which to look out, take things in, assess what's happening. No core lens through which to see the world, to make judgments and comprehend risk. Random moments of time follow one another. Sights, sounds, thoughts, and feelings don't go together. No organizing principle takes successive moments in time and puts them together in a coherent way from which sense can be made. And it's all taking place in slow motion. (p. 89)The clinical manifestations of psychosis are illustrated in these two examples, with evidence of hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, and disorganization. Psychosis is a disturbance of cognition, not a global loss of cognitive capacity as seen within dementing illnesses. Indeed, psychosis is a \"gain-of-function\" symptom, with increased associational productions, bizarre perceptual experiences, thoughts, and established memories with psychotic content. This is in contrast to the dementias, which are \"loss-of-function\" cognitive disorders, in which memory is reduced and thought processes are altered and frequently diminished. Because psychotic experiences appear entirely real to the person suffering them, it is easy for the individual to act on the psychotic perceptions (i.e., command hallucinations) or the delusional thinking, which can result in bizarre, illogical, or even dangerous behavior. Psychosis is a broadly expressed symptom set across many diagnoses and can be called an intermediate phenotype or a symptom complex that may have a unique and independent brain network and biology and its own genetic associations. One could argue that the intermediate phenotype of psychosis is a symptom dimension representing a final common pathway of cerebral dysfunction (we would argue that psychosis is secondary to a disorder of learning and memory mechanisms) even though it is generated by diverse etiologies. It is possible to conceive that this symptom set has its own unique and distinctive anatomy, pathophysiology, and molecular targets, as well as treatments, although this has yet to be demonstrated. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) system from the National Institute of Mental Health is a leading example of this reorientation. In the RDoC framework, dimensions of normal cognition and affect are the unifying, homogenous units that decompose to generate psychopathology.",

Method The case of a 17‐year‐old reporting escalating anxiety and migraine headaches is presented. A mental health assessment, parental information, screening tools, the Personality Assessment Inventory, ongoing observation, review of treatment regimens, consultation, and test results from other healthcare professionals are included in the ongoing assessment. Findings Symptoms including anxiety, auditory and tactile hallucinations, mood alterations, substance use, insomnia, and hypomanic symptoms are identified. The symptoms are suggestive of various diagnostic categories/diagnoses: mood disorder, prodromal schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Conclusion A thorough assessment does not necessarily lead to clarity of a diagnosis or diagnoses. Clarity may evolve over time; however, this does not eliminate the responsibility to treat the patient. It is important to consider and utilize evidence‐based treatments for the symptomatology and possible diagnoses.",

The main problem has been the lack of reliable data compounded by the stigma of a mental diagnosis. More recently, third-party pressures have become an added threat to objectivity. New knowledge of brain function, especially neurotransmitters, and more specific and effective medication have made the need for accurate diagnoses more acute. Psychiatry has responded by frequent and often controversial changes in its diagnostic criteria. Much of the controversy stems from a lack of accurate measurements to validate the diagnoses, thereby allowing for differences of opinion of a highly subjective nature. The problem is complicated by the chronic, but irrational, belief that there is a separation between mental and somatic illness.",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Older Men: If Only Time Healed All Wounds",
      "abstract": "Trauma has been noted as hidden variable in lives of older adults that affects psychological, social, physiological, and behavioral functioning. Understandings of trauma have evolved considerably in more than two decades of research since initial entry of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 1980 publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). Originally a diagnostic category for war trauma primarily studied in Vietnam veterans, PTSD has been applied to individuals of all ages who have suffered a wide variety of both combat- and noncombat-related traumas. Thus effects of trauma in older populations have been acknowledged, but thorough research remains to be done. Currently FTSD is defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV TR, 2000) as occurring after one experiences, witnesses, or confronts a traumatic event including actual or threatened death, serious injury, or a threat to bodily integrity of self or others that evokes fear, helplessness, or horror. Traumatic events include physical assault, natural or man-made disasters, combat, and captivity (Cook and O'Donnell, 2005). Symptoms of PTSD include re-experiencing (flashbacks or visceral responses), avoidance activities (such as drinking or drug use), and arousal or hypervigilance. FTSD is considered acute if symptoms last less than three months, and chronic if symptoms continue for more than three months. A BRIEF HISTORY OF PTSD The definition of PTSD has broadened since 1980, though diagnostic category is direct result of efforts of veterans of Vietnam War and psychologists to label and treat their experience (Scott, 1993). Combat-related FTSD was thought to be contemporary version of fatigue or shock, a psychological disintegration found to occur under stresses of combat. As carry as Civil War, some combatants reported to have had difficulty adjusting to stress of battle (Scott, 1993). The Surgeon General of Union Army described condition as nostalgia and recommended that such individuals should be retained in combat zone but reassigned to less stressful duties. However, nostalgia was not treated by psychiatric specialists until Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and it was not until World War I that military began planning for psychiatric casualties as an integral part of their support operations (Bourne, 1970). During World War I, soldiers' breakdowns thought to be related to proximity of exploding shells and thus labeled shell shock. Mental impairment was linked to an organic cause-shell explosions causing a concussion of brain. This organic model was called into question, though, by cases of among who had not been near explosions (Showalter, 1985). Such cases summarily written offas outright cowardice or lack of moral fiber and considered (Bourne, 1970, p. II). During this war, treatments for shell shock and emotional shock differed dramatically. Those deemed emotionally shocked were kept near forward medical units and treated with painful electric shocks, threats of imprisonment and even execution while shell-shocked soldiers were evacuated to medical facilities further to rear (Bourne, 1970, p. 12). Treatment for emotional shock was perceived to be highly effective, with a majority of patients returning to combat, while shell-shocked patients had a lower rate of recovery, which was thought to be result of organic nature of their problems. Later systematic clinical tests concluded that there was not an organic component to shell shock (Showalter, 1985). Gradually, psychiatric community came to conclusion that the emotional stress of prolonged exposure to violent death was sufficient to produce a neurotic syndrome resembling hysteria in men (Herman, 1992, p. …",

Researches by the Barany methods, especially when these were complemented by necropsies with microscopic investigation, have furnished facts of importance in diagnostic symptomatology. First, the cause of vertigo, that symptom which so frequently confronts not only the neurologist and otologist, but also physicians at large, is often a perplexing problem. No matter where the primary seat of the affection which causes vertigo may be situated, whether in the stomach, kidney, liver, pancreas, tonsils, or the brain outside of the vestibular apparatus, the resulting toxemia, the abnormal nervous stimulus, or the cardiovascular disorder does not produce vertigo",

The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Digital syndactyly is a common congenital anomaly and is associated with other anomalies affecting the digits, the hand, the arm or even the entire body. In the past it has been considered a single entity. However, recent information provided by experimental embryology, studies of morphogenesis and other sources, suggests that there are at least two distinct entities: primary syndactyly due to interference with the sequence of events that normally culminate in the division of digits into discrete parts and secondary syndactyly due to readhesion of adjacent digits as a result of close contact between raw surfaces. Primary syndactylyl may arise de novo, or it may occur as a manifestation of a mutation phenomenon or as a genetically controlled syndrome. Secondary syndactyly is the result of mechanical adhesion of adjacent parts involved in a general reparative or healing process. The initial insult leading to amputation of a portion of the digits may or may not be genetically controlled; adhesion is fortuitous. Management of syndactyly is determined by the complexity of the malformation. For simple cutaneous syndactyly the surgeon should make a zigzag incision and provide a rectangular, proximally based flap for the floor of the web, usually before the child is 2 years of age. A full- or split-thickness skin graft should be applied to the defects. For complex deformities involving several digits and associated with postural or osseous malformation, several operative procedures may be required. The surgeon must be vigilant to note and correct the sequelae resulting from recurrent contractures and imbalances associated with growth.",

      "title": "Analysis of Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Variations in Psychological Stress",
      "abstract": "Purpose: Mental stress and other psychosomatic disorders have been linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in population studies. There hasn't been a thorough examination as to whether emotional or physical stresses might cause sporadic ventricular arrhythmias in vulnerable patients. An outsized and mounting body of discovery shed light on the fact that internal health is interrelated to risk factors for heart complaint before an opinion of an internal health complaint and through treatment. These things can arise both directly, through natural pathways, and laterally, through parlous health actions. People who are passing through clinical depression, anxiety disorders, common and general stress syndromes, and indeed post-traumatic stress disorder commonly known as PTSD over an absolute period of your occasion may observe definite physiological alterations in the body, similarly, as a highly enlarged cardiac reactivity such as augmented vital signs and elevated blood pressure, deducted or condensed blood inflow directly to the center, and heightened or highly raised amount of an organic chemical compound called cortisol. Over time, these physiologic processes may generate calcium particle depositions or buildup within the normal organic pathways. It may also manifest events of body metabolic dysfunction as well as cardiac conduction problems. Substantiation shows that many physiological and psychiatric/psychological diseases -similar to chronic clinical depression, psychological stress, and PTSD can appear after any cardiac event regardless of its severity. Objective: The focal objective of this article is to identify psychological stress, its influence on cardiac problems such as cardiac arrhythmia, and its symptomatic manifestations on an electrocardiogram. Apart from that, this paper also focuses on the area of how ECG changes due to psychological distress. Another objective of this paper is to provide vivid information about psychological stress and its link with acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Laymen should know the fact that the mind and the body are linked with each other and if the mind is distressed for a long time will affect the health condition of the physical body also. Design/Methodology/Approach: To build the paper, mostly secondary information has been used from various sources such as clinical literature, journals, websites, etc. Primary information has also been used to increase the accuracy and reliability of the paper. Primary data have been taken from neuropsychologists, cardiologists, clinical psychopathologists, and behavioral medicine specialists. Based on all these databases, systematic and scientific clinical analysis of information has been done to avoid any mistakes and errors. Findings/Result: In people with ICDs, stress and physical exercise might cause ventricular rhythm abnormalities. Future studies into medicines that prevent these stimuli' responses might reduce ventricular arrhythmias and upsets in some of these patients. People with type A personalities should try to control or adjust their innate personality and character to reduce the vulnerability to develop any kind of cardiac arrhythmia or any other cardiac pathologies. All ECG variations and arrhythmias are not related to psychological stress rather it needs differential diagnosis to rule out any other underlying problems. A thorough differential investigation is suggested to rule out whether the cardiac problem is due to psychological stress or not. Originality and value: A comprehensive analysis and interpretation have been made to cover the concerned topic of study and make information more reliable and valid. A new initiative is taken to provide information about the mind and heart link. Paper Type: Secondary clinical report analysis/interpretive paper",

      "title": "Unveiling the enigma of peduncular hallucinations: Visual hallucination following occipital lobe infarct",
      "abstract": "Dear Sir, Peduncular Hallucination (PH), initially delineated by Lhermitte in 1922[1] predominantly manifests as intricate visual phenomena, often endowed with realism and dynamism, frequently involving familiar figures and locales. Despite these vivid episodes, patients grapple with differentiating their hallucinations from actuality, though they generally retain a degree of insight into their hallucinatory nature. Remarkably, the authenticity of these hallucinations is so convincing that individuals frequently engage in verbal or even physical interactions with the perceived entities or environments. PH instances tend to occur more frequently during the nocturnal hours or in dimly lit settings. During interludes between these hallucinatory episodes, patients exhibit unimpaired memory and consistently provide accurate descriptions of their hallucinatory experiences, even in the presence of cognitive impairment affecting other facets of their daily lives.[2] Etiologically, the onset of PH typically follows an acute ischemic or hemorrhagic event affecting the midbrain, thalamus, or pons, with posterior circulation infarction emerging as the prevailing causative factor.[3] An intriguing neurological mechanism potentially contributing to the emergence of peduncular hallucinations involves the diaschisis phenomenon. In this context, a lesion in the left occipital region may induce dysfunction in midbrain structures through a diaschisis mechanism.[4] Over a span of 2 months, the patient experienced episodes of dizziness and stumbled while walking. Fortunately, these falls did not result in any physical harm or loss of consciousness. There were no post-fall complications such as seizures, confusion, memory impairment, or bleeding. Initial days following the falls seemed normal. However, after this period, family members noticed peculiar behavior. The patient began murmuring to himself consistently throughout the day and expressed a belief that a group of 6 to 7 individuals intended to harm him. He vividly described these people and their attempts to harm him, including methods like administering poison and electrocution. Strangely, he even reported seeing vehicles like trains inside his house, animals like rabbits, and vibrant colors such as pink, yellow, red, and green surrounding him. Remarkably, these visual occurrences persisted even when he closed his eyes and took place while he was fully conscious. Although initially distressed, he gradually comprehended that these were only images, leading to a reduction in his distress. The patient's basic functioning, including self-care, appetite, and interactions with relatives, remains relatively unaffected, as stated by family members and observed behavior. Upon examination of the central nervous system, parameters such as visual acuity, color perception, and eye movements appeared normal. Pupillary reflexes were within the expected range. Motor, sensory, and cranial assessments yielded normal results. Intentional tremors were present, but rigidity was absent. The patient exhibited a wide-based gait and faced difficulties during tests like the Romberg test and in performing tasks involving alternating movements and tandem walking. He is also a known case of hypertension for the past 5 years on Telmisartan 40mg, and his Blood pressure was maintained on this medication. Despite these issues, vital signs remained stable, and other systemic examinations revealed no notable abnormalities. However, a diagnosis of Parietal Hallucinosis was established based on his CT-Brain, which revealed an infarction in the left occipital lobe, as illustrated in Figure 1.Figure 1: CT brain (plain) showing the left occipital lobe infarct. The blue arrow marks shows the region of infarct in the left occipital regionThe patient commenced a daily regimen of Donepezil 5mg once daily and Melatonin 10 mg at bedtime. Following three days of consistent medication, there was a notable subjective reduction of approximately 50–60% in the frequency and vividness of visual hallucinations. In addition, the patient and their family members received psychoeducation regarding the nature and etiology of hallucinations and the underlying neurobiology. The presented case report sheds light on the intriguing and complex phenomenon of PH. PH is a rare and distinctive form of hallucination characterized by vivid and dynamic visual experiences that closely resemble perceptions yet lack external sensory stimuli. This case illustrates the typical features of PH, including the patient's struggle to differentiate between the hallucinatory experiences and reality, the realistic and complex nature of the hallucinations, and the tendency to engage in interactions with the perceived entities. The pathophysiology of PH remains under investigation. This report highlights its association with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic events affecting brain regions like the midbrain, thalamus, or pons, often linked to posterior circulation infarction.[5] These lesions disrupt neurotransmitter systems and sensory pathways, potentially due to imbalanced cholinergic and serotonergic activity.[6] Additionally, the concept of diaschisis proposes that a lesion in one area can impair interconnected regions, potentially explaining PH emergence from a lesion in the left occipital region affecting midbrain structures.[4] Treatment approaches encompass both pharmacological interventions targeting cholinergic and sleep-related pathways, as well as non-pharmacological strategies including cognitive-behavioral therapies and psychoeducation.[7] Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

      "title": "Seizures: Behavioral",
      "abstract": "Abstract The question of whether an individual has experienced a seizure or has recurrent seizures (epilepsy) is often encountered in the forensic setting. Such questions are often raised in cases of alleged personal injury, usually in cases of apparent brain injury. The impact of seizures in a patient's life is also often at issue in cases involving disability law and employment discrimination. Occasionally, death or injuries related to epilepsy are at issue in the court, or the impact of a mother's use of antiepileptic drugs resulting in apparent birth defects. In the criminal arena, criminal acts are sometimes attributed to seizure activity or to brain dysfunction associated with epilepsy. Classification of seizures and epileptic syndromes are one goal of the assessment of the seizure disorder patient. Diagnostic methods include neurological examination, preferably by a neurologist skilled in the field of epileptology. The evaluation will also likely include EEG testing and brain imaging studies. Careful consideration of differential diagnosis issues is critical, as many medical and psychiatric syndromes closely resemble the presentation of seizure disorder. One key differential is ruling out psychogenic seizures or pseudoseizures. When seizures figure into a potential criminal defense (automatism) for aggressive behavior, careful forensic neurological assessment is warranted to determine the medicolegal validity of such a defense.",

In DSM system, such reactive disorders are listed as adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder, brief psychotic disorder with marked stressor and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, a growing number of individuals is suffering from a prolonged feeling of embitterment after exceptional negative life events and this condition could be diagnosed neither PTSD nor adjustment disorder nor depressive disorder in the context of DSM-IV diagnostic system. This clinical condition can be described as 'posttraumatic embitterment disorder' (PTED). PTED is a reactive disorder triggered by exceptional, though normal negative life events such as conflict in the workplace, unemployment, death of a relative, divorce, severe illness, or experience of loss or separation. The common feature of such events is that they are experienced as unjust, as a personal insult, accompanied by psychological violation of basic beliefs and values. The central psychopathological response pattern in PTED is a prolonged feeling of embitterment. In particular, the core emotion of embitterment can lead to the rejection of treatment. Therefore, wisdom therapy as a new treatment approach specifically designed for PTED has been developed. It is assumed that many patients suffering from PTED are often misunderstood and misdiagnosed. This review would help to introduce PTED into the clinical field in psychiatry.】",

Evidence suggest that mood and anxiety disorders are intrinsic to the neurobiology of dystonia, but also that psychiatric co-morbidity can be secondary to pain experience and the psychosocial functioning and quality of life of the patients. Medical treatment of dystonia with botulinum toxin injections into affected muscles or with deep brain stimulation surgery improves the symptoms as well as mood and the quality of the patients and does not produce any adverse effects on cognitive function.",

Instead, they present to their doctors wanting an explanation. Somatisation is one of many labels referring to bodily symptoms in relation to psychosocial distress.1 Other terms in current use are functional illness and medically unexplained symptoms (MUS).2,3\n\nThe incidence of somatising illness is about 30% of new presentations,4 while the cost to the NHS in the UK has been estimated in the billions.3 Many doctors find assessment and management difficult, using investigations to exclude disease before they feel sufficiently confident to explore the possibility of stress-related illness.5 This approach of ‘diagnosis by exclusion’ frequently wastes time and money. It can also lead to ‘somatic fixation’: an overemphasis on physical symptoms and investigations while avoiding personal and psychological issues.6\n\nSomatisation can often be a positive diagnosis, rather than by exclusion.5 Diagnosis at the first consultation is possible by asking specific questions to identify common patterns of somatising illness.

Although, the importance of emotional ventilation can never be understated in order to manage mental health, according to the WHO, depression is a mental disorder that is identified by a loss of pleasure or interest in daily activities for a long period of time, the causes of which may vary from physical or emotional abuse to severe losses in life. Depression needs to be diagnosed and treated, whereas the misuse of the term may lead to misidentification and the illusion that talking to loved ones and getting indulged in one’s favourite activities can cure it.",

      "title": "A Case of Recurrent Pseudocyesis",
      "abstract": "A CASE OF RECURRENT PSEUDO CYESIS C. KNIGHT ALDRICH, MD* Pseudocyesis (false pregnancy) is, in a way, the ultimate psychosomatic condition in that the interrelationship among psychological and somatic causes and psychological and somatic symptoms is welldefined and relatively uncontroversial. Pseudocyesis has been recognized since the time of Hippocrates. Its incidence has been reported [1] as one case per 250 pregnancies. The signs and symptoms of amenorrhea, abdominal and uterine enlargement, changes in breasts and cervix, fetal movements, and nausea, vomiting, and weight gain have led physicians through the centuries to misdiagnose pregnancy as often as once in three cases, even in recent years [1, 2]. Symptoms are often related with such complete conviction by the patient that the physician or obstetrician is led to omit examinations or tests he might otherwise perform. Earlier psychodynamic formulations considered pseudocyesis to be a manifestation of a hysterical conversion. Later formulations viewed the condition as an organ neurosis. A more recent view [3] implicates depression as a major determinant. Childhood deprivation, the need to avoid abandonment or loss of love object, and the fear of losing the capacity to bear a child (most cases occur in childless women of an average age of thirty-three) have been implicated as potential contributors to causation. Psychophysiological correlates have also been explored. Fried et al. report that \"the psychic factor ... is capable of affecting the pituitary, probably by way of the hypothalamus, causing the release of lactogenic hormones, the suppression of follicle stimulating hormone and consequent persistence of lutein function with the production of estrogen and progesterone\" [pp. 1332-1333]. Brown and Barglow [3] postulate that depression is associated with alterations in the neuronal networks connecting the higher brain centers with the median eminence of the hypothalamus. This is as- * Professor of psychiatry, New Jersey School of Medicine, 100 Bergen Street, Newark, New Jersey 07103. Perspectives in Biology and Medicine · Autumn 1972 | II sociated with a decrease of available biogenic amines at the neuronal receptor sites in the region of the median eminence. There is a resultant suppression of the release of follicle stimulating hormone releasing factor (FRF), luteinizing hormone releasing factor (LRF), and prolactin inhibitory factor (PIF) from the median eminence. The anterior pituitary reacts by decreasing follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion and by increasing prolactin secretion. The decrease of FSH and LH prevents ovulation and results in amenorrhea. The increased prolactin promotes lactation (and may support the persistence of the corpus luteum if prolactin is luteotropic). [P. 227] Most of the patients discussed at length in previous reports have had a single episode of pseudocyesis. Case histories of recurrent pseudocyesis have not, to my knowledge, been reported in detail, although there are brief accounts of up to four occurrences in one subject [4]. The following history describes a patient who suffered two episodes in a span of approximately four years. Case History The patient's parents were married near the turn of the century. It was a marriage of convenience, arranged because both fathers thought that it would consolidate a merger of their extensive international interests. At the time of her marriage, Mrs. T. was twentyfour , a plain, stout, highly religious woman with neither interest nor competence in the hectic social life which already appealed to her eighteen-year-old husband, and which was to appeal to him even more over the years. The couple had little in common: she had been born and educated in Europe and never felt as comfortable speaking English as she did speaking her native tongue. He was intelligent and attractive, and grew up to be competent and successful in business as well as in society . Both were fond of children, but they were disappointed when five successive pregnancies led to miscarriages or stillborn infants. By the time a living daughter, Mary, was born, on 2/18/16, even their shared affection for the child was not enough to bring them together. Mr. T., much warmer in temperament than his wife, was obviously delighted with his daughter. He indulged her, lavished affection on her, and loved to show her off to company. Her more restrained mother, on the other hand, showed little outward affection toward...",

The canonical phenotypeof the Parkinson's disease Dementia (PD-D) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) includes deficit of attention, executiveand visuospatial functions, and presents often with apathy, hallucinations, delusions, excessive daytime sleepiness,or sleep disorders. However, the clinical expression may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases associatedwith cognitive disorders. Thus, while clinicians rely on phenomenological patterns to infer the disease causing thecognitive impairment, the inference is weakened by the heterogeneous clinical expression of the disease. In addition,recent post-mortem studies seem to undermine the supposed pathology-phenotype coherence, making it moreand more unreliable the diagnosis based on symptoms. The lack of coherence between phenotype and pathologymay support the speculation about a common mechanism underlying the progression of the disease. While it is verylikely that a distinct, specific causal event determines the disease itself, the progression might well follow commonpatterns. A number of observations suggest that progressive diseases, which cause cognitive impairment, share aprion-like mechanism. A seeding process is supposed to account for the spreading of the lesion.",

El estrés es una causa de tensión y exigencia o mecanismo de adaptación.El estrés y la presentación del primer episodio depresivo están directamente relacionados, sin embargo cuando se presentan recurrencias el estrés significativo pierde fuerza dentro de los factores que lo desencadenan. Los estresores, especialmente los psicosociales, están relacionados con la presentación de recurrencias. Entre estos se destacan estresores internos y externos, por sucesos vitales, estrés de rol y las contrariedades cotidianas, la alta exigencia y el perfeccionismo. El no cumplimiento de metas es otro factor provocador de crisis en la transición del ciclo vital. El neuroticismo y el perfeccionismo, como actitudes disfuncionales provocan aislamiento y falta de soporte social. Los esquemas cognitivos disfuncionales conducen a un procesamiento erróneo de la información. La depresión es una pauta de relación que no permite encontrar formas adaptativas de enfrentar la vida y conducir las relaciones interpersonales. Aunque hay nuevas visiones que la consideran como un esfuerzo adaptativo. La comorbilidad puede hacer recurrir la depresión. Se ha sugerido que patrones maladaptativos cognitivos, en particular en interacción con estresores, podrían llevar a pobres resultados en el tratamiento de sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor en comorbilidad con trastornos de personalidad.

It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Effect of optimism/pessimism attitude on depression and coping strategies",
      "abstract": "Depression is a word used by mental health professional to refer an illness or group of illness called mood disorder. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. It's impossible to escape life's ups and downs. Feeling unhappy or sad in response to disappointment, loss, frustration or a medical condition is normal. Many people use the word to explain these kinds of feelings, but that is really situational depression, which is a normal reaction to events around us. Clinical depression, though, overwhelms and engulfs your day to day life, interfering with your ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and have fun. It is unrelenting, with little if any relief. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for an extended period of it.There is a difference, however, between a normal grief reaction and one that is disabling or unrelenting. While there's no set timetable for grieving, if it doesn't let up over time or extinguishes all signs of joy laughing at a good joke, brightening in response to a hug, appreciating a beautiful sunsetit may be depression. Brown and Haris (1978) reported that depression increases with the age due to several factors of day today life like burden of responsibility, sleeping problems, declining health etc.Coping strategies refer to the specific efforts, both behavioral and psychological, that people employ to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize stressful events.There are many different ways of coping but they all involve making some change in input-output relationships. Thus some methods of coping involve changing, controlling and even avoiding certain inputs, whether the problem is attacked by working on inputs that in internal processes or outputs, it will be one of the two major ways of adjustingdefensive coping or direct coping. Defensive coping involves protecting oneself by getting away from threatening inputs. Direct coping involves meeting challenges head on. Coping with stress may begin with the occurrence of a stressful even, during exposure to stressor and finally after it has taken places. However, successful coping with stress should depend on a number of factors such as individual attitude, perception of life stress and suffering and personal skills, capability of problem solving and decision making. Raju, Rohini, and Naga (2008) revealed that among the old age people 21.3% of them were severely depressed and diabetes is experienced mostly by the elderly whose age is between 70-80 years. The severely depressed older adults were suffering with blood pressure and asthma. The mildly depressed older adult's experiences suicidal tendencies, hearing problems, loneliness, diabetes and problem with the eyes.Sahu, (2007) found gender differences on life stress and significant negative relationship between life stress and coping was observed. It was also extended for males but this relationship was not found significant for females. Folkman, S. and Lazarus, R.S (1980) evaluated age difference in the use of problem focused coping and emotion focused coping among individuals aged 45 to 64. The younger group was found to use emotion focused approach more i.e. they used more of accepting responsibility, distancing more than o lder group.Considering the above facts the present study was undertaken to observe the Optimists and Pessimists on Depression and Coping strategies.Hypotheses of the studyTo achieve the main objective of the study following hypothesis are framed;* Optimists will have significantly low level of Depression as compared to Pessimists and its dimensions.* Optimists and pessimists will differ significantly on the tendency of using Coping Strategies and its dimensions.MethodParticipantsThe total sample was consisted of 255 optimists and 191 pessimists subjects. …",

Though the underlying mechanism still remains unclear, there are two assumptions explaining the associations between somatic symptoms and depression. One is that depression itself causes several somatic symptoms. That is, people with depression may express their mental conflicts in various somatic symptoms. This hypothesis could apply especially to those who have a vague feeling of stigma or prejudice against mental disorders, and who are reluctant to frankly express their mental symptoms. From another point of view, this might mean that some chronic somatic symptoms are magnified due to the person’s depressive state. Another possible hypothesis is that those who have had chronic somatic symptoms of unknown origin, in other words, functional somatic symptoms, are likely to be depressed since they cannot always receive effective medical treatment for such symptoms.",

Disturbances in these areas of functioning are extremely common and may be caused by psychological and/or physical disturbances. Many other areas of fundamental biological functioning can be influenced psychologically, including disturbances in urination, temperature sense, heart rate, defecation, thirst, or sweating. Fever is always medical in etiology, unless it is documented to be factitious. Urinary or fecal incontinence in an adult should be considered to have a physical basis under all circumstances. When vegetative symptoms in the areas of sleep, sex, eating, and/or energy level persist for some time and no medical disorder is apparent, patients and clinicians often assume that the cause is emotional.",

      "title": "Burnout and its impact on Nurses and Doctors",
      "abstract": "Burnout is a highly researched syndrome resulting from job stress. It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

      "abstract": "The aim of this analysis was to highlight the significance of psychotherapy in the treatment of depressive mood disorders in older adults, as well as to expand the knowledge of social educators and geragogists regarding the basic symptoms of depression. Depressive Disorders, according to the DSM-5 Classification by the American Psychiatric Association, include, among others: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, and Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. The occurrence of Depressive Disorders causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning across various areas of life (personal, familial, social, and occupational). Therefore, depression in old age should not be analyzed without considering the individual and social aspects of an elderly person’s functioning. However, it is important to remember to consider its symptoms as a disease and not to misinterpret them as symptoms of the aging process. Bipolar and Related Disorders occur relatively rarely in old age; however, mild depression or depression with symptoms that do not form a complete syndrome is observed more frequently. Such diagnoses justify prioritizing psychotherapeutic interventions or potentially combining them with pharmacotherapy. CBT therapy is an effective way to support older people with depressive disorders in their recovery.",

Unfortunately, it often strikes the individual at the height of his productivity. The first symptom of the condition may be a decrease in expected level of functioning, and thus the disease may be very closely tied to the patient's work or professional status. It is important to note that the symptoms that usher in the process of dementia differ little from those that occur in normal people who are exhausted, anxious, or under severe pressure.

If we avoid Cartesian dualism, the claim that mental disorders are biological is obviously a tautology. Given the facts above, psychiatric diagnostic manuals, such as the DSM and ICD, are school examples of what evidence-based science is not and represent nothing but a failed attempt to build a legal road from Health Care to Hell Care by over-medicalization and by the suffering of human and non-human animals. Furthermore, psychiatric drugs can have long-lasting effects on the brain and the central nervous system, while, the withdrawal from them can cause a range of severe physical and psychological effects.",

Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

      "title": "Specific Phobia vs Panic Disorder in Children: A Unique Case Report and Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Specific phobia is defined as marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear and anxiety, is actively avoided, or endured with intense fear or anxiety that is out proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object/situation and to the sociocultural context. These symptoms are persistent and last for at least six months. The prevalence of specific and social phobia in children and adolescents is 2.9 and 0.3%. Panic disorder is defined as recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and is accompanied by at least 4/13 symptoms. One of these panic attacks must be followed by at least one month of constant worry about additional panic attacks and their consequences. There is a significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks. Such disturbances are not attributable to physiological effects of other substances, medical conditions, or other mental disorders. The prevalence of panic disorders is 5 – 15 percent in adolescents and 5 percent in children.\r\n\r\nCase Presentation: We present a case of a 3-year old male with panic attacks for over one year which started after an incident of smoke detector alarm followed by three more episodes of panic attacks at the daycare center. The recent episode was 4 weeks ago. After the last incident, the patient stopped eating and refused food which worsened over the past 2 weeks. The patient was evaluated and diagnosed with panic disorder, specific phobia, eating disorder, and referred to outpatient Psychologist.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n• Learn about anxiety disorders in children.\r\n\r\n• Management options for anxiety in children.\r\n\r\n• Etiopathogenesis of anxiety in children.\r\n\r\nConclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of panic disorder below the age of 4. We conducted a literature review and found no cases published. This is an interesting case for psychiatrists, therapists and pediatricians to learn as there is a lack of evidence in treating children under the age of 4. No medication recommendations were available for this age group; however, off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication was discussed with the patient’s mother who refused. We agreed with the primary care team’s recommendations and the case was referred to an out-patient psychotherapist.",

The mind may be upset, just as the temper may be ruined, by slight domestic worries; and this disturbance of mind may be followed by disease of the brain. In my experience, the brain is destroyed in general paralytics more frequently by constant causes of excitement or anxiety and worry, than by any sudden injury or shock.",

It has a massive personal and socioeconomic impact, as it is a disease with high morbidity and mortality. Both young and old people are affected, as a result of traffic or sports accidents as well as due to falls at home. The term TBI encompasses various clinical pictures, differing considerably in cause, prognosis and therapy. What they all have in common is the pathophysiological cascade that develops immediately after the initial trauma and which can persist for several days and weeks. In this phase, medical treatment, whether surgical or pharmacological, attempts to reduce the consequences of the primary damage. The aim is to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure and to reduce intracranial pressure.Das Schädel-Hirn-Trauma (SHT) bezeichnet eine durch äußere Gewalteinwirkung bedingte Schädigung des Gehirnparenchyms. Es verursacht massive individuelle und sozioökonomische Folgen aufgrund der hohen Morbidität und Mortalität.

      "title": "Differential Diagnosis Between Schizophrenia and in Major Depression: The Importance of Abnormal Bodily Phenomena",
      "abstract": "Introduction Anomalies of bodily experience have for long been described as relevant features of schizophrenia and major depression, yet such experiences are usually neglected in clinical examination. Bodily experience is the implicit background of our experiences against which we develop a coherent sense of self as a unified, bounded entity, naturally immersed in a social world of meaningful others. Such tacit experiential background is often perturbed in schizophrenia and major depression. Empirical research shows that patients with schizophrenia and major depression frequently present many different kinds of anomalies of bodily experience in the course of their illness. Objective To characterize the abnormal bodily phenomena in both schizophrenia and major depression. Aim To improve differential diagnosis based on the identification of typical features of abnormal bodily experiences in persons affected by schizophrenia and major depression and to provide supplementary diagnostic criteria. Method Analysis of empirical and theoretical research published in the last 25 years. Result Ongoing bodily feelings of disintegration/violation and nothingness/mechanization (e.g. one's body experienced as a object-like mechanism) are the most typical experiences in people with schizophrenia whereas major depressives are not able to detach themselves from the experience of bodily failure or chrematization (from chrema = corpse, i.e., feeling like a corpse) and therefore, feel worthless, guilty, or decaying. They feel chrematized in their very self. Conclusion These experiences might be considered as specific and they can contribute to differential diagnosis of somatic complaints in schizophrenia and in major depression.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia requires both a report of poor sleep at night and residual daytime impairment associated with the poor sleep. Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

The diagnosis can only be made, however, in the absence of intoxication, hypothermia, or certain medical illnesses.A patient with severe hypoxic-ischemic brain injury met the three cardinal neurological features of brain death but concurrent profound hypothyroidism precluded the diagnosis. Our clinical and ethical decisions were further challenged by another facet of this complex case. Although her brain damage indicated a hopeless prognosis, we could not discontinue care based on futility because the only known surrogate was mentally retarded and unable to participate in medical planning.The presence of certain medical conditions prohibits a diagnosis of brain death, which is a medicolegal diagnosis of death, not a prediction or forecast of future outcome. While prognostication is important in deciding to withdraw care, it is not a component in diagnosing brain death.",

Backache is often persistent or recurrent. It is an indication for careful diagnostic history, physical examination, and adequate roentgenograms. Obesity and poor posture may be contributing causes. Other causes of backache should be considered in differential diagnosis. Backache of mechanical origin can be relieved in the vast majority of cases by suitable protective measures, by correction of obesity or faulty posture, by appropriate trunk-muscle exercises, and by training in good posture. Backache unrelieved by these treatments, especially if there is a severe structural defect, for example, spondylolysis, may be relieved by spine fusion. Sciatica is also a common cause of disability. Severe persistent sciatica is commonly due to protrusion or extrusion of the nucleus pulposus with pressure against the adjacent nerve root, and it may be associated with neurological signs of nerve-root pressure. Tumor of the cauda equina is considered in differential diagnosis. Partial or temporary relief may be obtained by bed rest for two or three weeks if sciatica is due to mild nerve-root pressure. Severe or persistent sciatica due to extrusion of a nucleus pulposus is best relieved by careful surgical removal of the material causing the pressure. The best permanent results are obtained by removal of the entire nucleus pulposus. Spine fusion at the same time will relieve the backache that usually precedes and accompanies disc rupture and will correct structural weakness in the lumbosacral region. Careful evaluation of the patient, meticulous surgical technique, adequate postoperative care, and an appropriate convalescent regimen are essential for a high percentage of good or excellent results.",

Against this background, experiments on circadian rhythms are outlined that yield a state of sustained sleepless activity. Such states can be brought about it seems by manipulation of the external zeitgebers to which rhythms are synchronized rather than by any alteration of the circadian clock. This can be expected to yield a disorganized rhythmic state rather than any discrete phase shifting or desynchronization of rhythms. This state it is suggested should lead to a mild dysphoria, psychomotor activation and a subtle disordering of thought form. It is proposed that these changes lead to the typical clinical picture of mania when distorted cognitively by mechanisms similar to those found in depression. There are a number of implications of this hypothesis. Firstly, mania should commonly be precipitated by similar psychosocial factors to those which precipitate depression. Secondly, similar neuroendocrine findings should be found in both depression and mania. Thirdly, similar agents should be effective in the treatment of mania and depression. Fourthly, cognitive therapy may play a significant part in the management of acute episodes of mania and reduce liability to chronicity.",

      "abstract": "The physical symptoms attending the general paralysis of the insane have been shown to present in their progress three well-defined stages. Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

      "title": "Brief review of pathophysiological disorders as consequence of psychological stress",
      "abstract": "Background: Psychological stress is a reaction to an unexpected situation that favours adaptation and response to the event. However, when psychological stress is chronic or very intense, it can induce changes in various systems and tissues, causing diseases or aggravating existing ones. Objective: To briefly analyse the pathophysiological conditions caused by psychological stress. Method: A narrative review of the scientific literature on pathophysiological conditions as a consequence of psychological stress was performed. Results: Psychological stress can induce various conditions at the gastrointestinal, immune and cardiovascular levels. This is mainly due to the neurobiological and endocrine response because when faced with a stressful stimulus, a deregulated release of glucocorticoids and catecholamines is generated, altering the normal physiology of the organism. Gastrointestinal disorders are mainly due to goblet cell dysfunction, resulting in intestinal hyperpermeability, inflammation and infection. Changes at the immune level lead to an increase in inflammatory responses but a decrease in the protective activities of the immune system. Finally, cardiovascular conditions include atherosclerosis, increased blood pressure and stroke. Conclusion: Psychological stress can induce real physiological pathologies and, in some cases, fatal ones. Some of the molecular mechanisms involved in these pathologies have already been studied and identified. Knowledge of these molecular mechanisms can help clinicians and therapists to improve the treatment and therapy of patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Objective: The definition of “hikikomori” evokes dysfunctional personality pictures already known in the literature and medical practice. The aim is to refute the hypothesis of the need to identify this clinical condition in a new descriptive framework. Materials and methods: Pubmed checklist, clinical interview, and psychometric tests. Results: In the entirety of the selected population, it emerges that the primary disorder is schizoid personality disorder; this is followed by depressive disorder, narcissistic covert disorder, bipolar disorder with depressive prevalence, obsessive disorder, avoidant disorder, and somatic disorder as secondary dysfunctional personality traits. Childhood and/or family trauma, capable of impacting the sexual and affective sphere, is present in almost the entire population. Conclusion: The syndrome should be framed as a specific phenomenon and not as a new psychopathological disorder, as the symptomatological descriptions are similar to the already known schizoid personality disorder; the symptomatological differences among patients should be framed according to a logic of correctives determined by the presence of one or more secondary psychopathological traits that draw a more complex personality picture than the simple nosographic diagnosis of the DSM-V.",

      "abstract": "What is the evolution of hysteria, now that the spectacular crises of previous times tend to occur less frequently? Are hysterical manifestations disappearing or do they take other forms? This question raises semantic and phenomenological problems concerning hysteria. A review of the literature shows the complexity and precariousness of some definitions, the question raised by associated organic disorders and the compounding influences of other nosological entities, such as depression and psychosomatic disorders. Clinical histories from the records of a psychiatric hospital for the period 1910-1929 were compared with those for the period 1970-1980. The results of the study were surprising with respect to the similarity of epidemiological profiles. If it can be concluded that hysterical manifestations are not disappearing, then the study confirms the evolution of symptomatology which, especially in women, takes atypical forms of depressive, neurovegetative or psychosomatic disorders. In males, hysterical symptoms are of a more acute nature and frequently occur in dependent, immature or infantile personalities, whilst in the past they were more chronic and frequently associated with more serious personality disorders.",

      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

Although classified as a somatic delusional disorder, DI requires special consideration due to its complicated clinical presentation, requiring attention to several possible explanations for the symptoms the patients describe. The purpose of the current review is to first summarize the clinical background and features of the diagnosis then explore treatment options. DI is a rare disorder though has reported cases dating back to the 19th century and spanning across the globe. Patients often experience the disorder as secondary to a medical condition, including substance use/withdrawal. However, there have also been many reported cases of primary DI, occurring in the absence of any other psychiatric or medical disorder. Clinically, DI is a diagnosis of exclusion, where the physician must rule out other medical conditions, including genuine dermatological disorders or infestations, or contributions from medications or substances. Patients with the disorder more commonly present to nonpsychiatric healthcare providers, making it essential for all clinicians to be able to identify the disease. Treatment can include either first or second generation antipsychotics, but it is important to proceed tactfully in discourse with the patient, being careful to address patients in a straightforward manner without reinforcing or questioning the delusion and focusing conversation on what can be done for the symptoms. Future research can continue to evaluate pathophysiology underlying primary DI, which historically has been an under-studied topic.",

      "title": "Depression and Mania in Patients with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Summary: Depression has a major impact on quality of life in patients with epilepsy and is also the main risk factor for the increased suicide rate in epilepsy. The frequency of depressive disorders depends on the severity of epilepsy and the localization of the epileptogenic focus, with a prevalence of ≤50% in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The diagnosis of depression in epilepsy may be difficult because symptoms of depression may be fluctuating, and some symptoms, such as memory complaints, may be misinterpreted as being a consequence of drug treatment or the epilepsy per se. Affective disorders in epilepsy may differ from those seen in patients without epilepsy. A possibility exists that patients with epilepsy will develop a specific interictal dysphoric syndrome related to limbic system dysfunction. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest a bidirectional relation between depression and epilepsy. Depression does not necessarily occur after the onset of epilepsy; the sequence may as well be the other way round, suggesting a common underlying mechanism for both disorders. Classic bipolar disorder type I is rarely seen in epilepsy, and manic episodes occur almost exclusively in the setting of postictal psychosis or after epilepsy surgery. This article explores the clinical manifestations of depressive and manic disorders in epilepsy and the differences from bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are particularly common presentations in primary care settings. They lie on a severity spectrum, with significant overlaps with other functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses like depression and anxiety, and general medical conditions. Typically, symptoms present with either no identifiable medical aetiology, or are disproportionate to the cause, with associated distress and preoccupations, health-related anxiety, and help-seeking behaviours. Cultural factors are known to shape shared mental representations about interpreting such symptom experiences and are therefore vital determinants of health and illness reporting. The nosology of MUS has been debated, deliberated, and transformed several times over the last century. Several models have been proposed to understand the pathogenesis of MUS based on the complex interaction of developmental, personality, cognitive–perceptual, cultural, and emotional processes within a bio-psycho-socio-cultural framework. Effective and sensitive communication of socio-culturally grounded and individualized illness formulations that link the individual’s belief systems, diagnosis, and treatment options are key to managing MUS. Medications are used to treat severe symptoms or comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Psychotherapy that targets coping, help-seeking behaviours, and real-world functioning is also effective.",

These stressors interact with personality traits and with a genetic predisposition to depression, thereby bringing about mdd. Therefore, the neurobiology of depression cannot be separated from the neurobiology of stress system. A substantial number of publications have in fact demonstrated that mdd patients show abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis, which is a key element of the stress response. Such disturbances are exacerbated by chronic stress, early experiences of abuse and even prenatal exposure to stress. On the other hand, genetic variations can play a role in the hpa axis dysfunction and in vulnerability to depression. Evidence is emerging that certain genes are directly involved in the functioning of the hpa axis. Other genetic factors, not directly related to the hpa axis, are probably relevant as well, the best known example being the serotonin transporter gene.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

A variety of psychological factors have been reported to be either predisposing or precipitating causes of migraine. Among the predisposing factors have been various personality attributes; neurosis and other psychiatric disorders. Among the precipitating factors are emotional reactions, changes in life situation; various psychosocial stresses, periods of overactivity and 'let down' periods. In addition to the operation of the above psychological factors, which constitute a psychosomatic sequence of events, there are also mood changes which may accompany an attack of migraine associated with alterations in energy, concentration, and ability to work. There may also be a somatopsychic sequence of events in which the sufferer may react in various ways to an attack of migraine just as he may react to any other illness or disability.",

      "abstract": "Delusion has always been a central topic for psychiatric research with regard to etiology and pathogenesis and to diagnosis, treatment, and forensic relevance. Throughout the history of psychiatry as a scientific discipline, there has been dissent on the issue of whether chronic delusion is a nosological entity of its own or just a specific type of another mental disorder, e.g. schizophrenia, mania, or personality disorder, and there already is a considerable literature on this. This article seeks to elucidate the central lines of thought that have governed the scientific debate on delusions and delusion-associated phenomena since the early 19th century. Special attention is given to the practical relevance of these theoretical considerations for forensic questions and psychiatric research. Due to the complex features of delusions, research in this area may well become paradigmatic for many other complicated psycho(patho)logical phenomena, e.g. consciousness, hallucinations and psychotic depression.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

He was hospitalized repeatedly and over long periods for surgical complications related to his disease. He presented with “problems of adjustment” in the surgery department. We met following nine months of hospitalization, when the patient complained of acute diarrhea with severe aftereffects preventing his release home, and which the surgeons could not explain. The surgeons then asked for the liaison psychiatrist’s opinion regarding a possible psychiatric disorder.\nDiscussion: The questions posed by the surgeons and the patient’s previous history suggested a diagnosis of a painful somatic symptom disorder. The patient had been treated in parallel for depression over the previous five months. Cognitive impairment in this patient could have been linked to the sequelae of an ischemic stroke or a central nervous system disorder.\nSpecific Aspects: This patient had a severe cognitive impairment and was in a socially precarious situation. Furthermore, Sharp’s syndrome is a systemic disease that can present significant psychiatric manifestations, as in Lupus. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms related to these psychiatric disorders are poorly known, and involve inflammatory, immunological, and infectious mechanisms. In addition, this patient had significant psychiatric and somatic comorbidities. Working together, social worker and nephrologist were able to achieve appropriate overall care management of this patient.\nConclusion: Mr. T, suffering from Sharp’s syndrome, presented with a painful somatic symptom disorder. The liaison psychiatrist recommended a multidisciplinary transversal management of the patient.",

Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression.

However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next.

      "title": "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder – An Overview",
      "abstract": "IntroductionPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to any event that result in psychological trauma.This event may involve the threat of death to oneself or to someone else, or to one's own or someone else's physical, sexual, or psychological integrity, overwhelming the individual's ability to cope.As an effect of psychological trauma, PTSD is less frequent but more enduring than the more commonly seen acute stress response.Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a persistent and sometimes crippling condition and develops in a significant proportion of individuals exposed to trauma, and untreated, can continue for years.Its symptoms can affect every life domain -physiological, psychological, occupational, and social.Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was first introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1980, making it one of the more recently accepted psychiatric disorders.PTSD is one of the few DSM diagnoses to have a recognizable etiologic agent, in that it must develop in direct response to a severe (sudden, terrifying, or shocking) life event (American Psychiatric Association 2000).Since the introduction of PTSD into DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association 1980), the disorder has been documented in children exposed to traumas such as domestic violence, natural disasters, medical trauma (such as hospitalization or medical procedures performed on children), war, terrorism, and community violence.According to the American Psychological Association, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as \"an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened.Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, such as terrorist attacks, motor vehicle accidents, rape, physical and sexual abuse, and other crimes, or military combat [1].\"PTSD is a problem in which the human brain continues to react with nervousness after the horrific trauma even though the original trauma is over.Brain can react by staying in \"overdrive\" and being hyperalert in preparation for the next possible trauma.Sometimes the brain continues to \"remember\" the trauma by having \"flashbacks\" about the event or nightmares even though the trauma was in the past. Historical backgroundReports of battle-associated stress reactions appeared as early as the 6th century BC.One of the first descriptions of PTSD was made by the Greek historian Herodotus.In 490 BC www.intechopen.comPost Traumatic Stress Disorders in a Global Context 4 Herodotus described, during the Battle of Marathon, an Athenian soldier who suffered no injury from war but became permanently blind after witnessing the death of a fellow soldier.In the early 19th century military medical doctors started diagnosing soldiers with \"exhaustion\" after the stress of battle.This \"exhaustion\" was characterized by mental shutdown due to individual or group trauma.Soldiers during the 19th century were not supposed to be scared or show any fear in the midst of battle.The only treatment for this \"exhaustion\" was to bring the afflicted back for a bit for a short term therapy and then send them back into battle.During the intense and frequently repeated stress, the soldiers became fatigued as a part of their body's natural shock reaction.According to Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker, \"One-tenth of mobilized American men were hospitalized for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.\"Previous diagnoses now considered historical equivalents of PTSD include railway spine, stress syndrome, shell shock, battle fatigue, or traumatic war neurosis.Although PTSD-like symptoms have also been recognized in combat veterans of many military conflicts, the modern understanding of PTSD dates from the 1970s, largely as a result of the problems that were still being experienced by US military veterans of the war in Vietnam.In its initial DSM-III (formulation 1980), a traumatic event was conceptualized as a catastrophic stressor that was outside the range of usual human experience.The framers of the original PTSD diagnosis had in mind events such as war, torture, rape, the Nazi Holocaust, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and volcano eruptions) and human-made disasters (such as factory explosions, airplane crashes, and automobile accidents).They considered traumatic events as clearly different from the very painful stressors that constitute the normal vicissitudes of life such as divorce, failure, rejection, serious illness and financial reverses.(By this logic adverse psychological responses to such \"ordinary stressors\" would, in DSM-III terms, be characterized as Adjustment Disorders rather than PTSD.)This dichotomization between traumatic and other stressors was based on the assumption that although most individuals have the ability to cope with ordinary stress, their adaptive capacities are likely to be overwhelmed when confronted by a traumatic stressor.The DSM-III diagnostic criteria for PTSD were revised in DSM-III-R (1987) and DSM-IV (1994) [2].A very similar syndrome is classified in .Since 1980 there has been a great deal of attention devoted to the development of instruments for assessing PTSD.Although an optimal evaluation of a patient for PTSD consists of a face-to-face interview by a mental health professional trained in diagnosing psychiatric disorders, several instruments are available to facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).These include screening tools, diagnostic instruments, and trauma and symptom severity scales.For example, there are brief screening tools, such as the 4-item Primary Care PTSD Screen, developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; self-report screening instruments, such as the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale; and structured or semi-structured interviews, such as the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (DIS-IV), and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI), www.intechopen.comPost Traumatic Stress Disorders in a Global Context 6 Country PTSD DALY rate, overall PTSD DALY rate, females PTSD DALY rate, males Thailand 59 86 30 Indonesia",

      "abstract": "The problem of the determination of the degree of culpability of an individual who has committed an anti-social act is sometimes associated with great difficulties. A variety of factors may enter into the solution of this problem. An illegal act may be committed accidentally or unexpectedly and independently of the individual's will. It may be committed under an unavoidable necessity, such as in cases of protection of ones self or ones family. It may be committed under the influence of extreme passion or anger, when consciousness becomes blurred and cerebral inhibition is obliterated. It may be committed by insane individuals whose delusional ideas, accompanied or not by hallucinatory images, develop morbid impulses or deliberate and well planned criminal tendencies. Finally, illegal acts may be committed by individuals who, though not insane in the strict sense of the word, are nevertheless different from normal individuals by their power of reasoning, by their sentiments, tastes, sympathies, etc. To this class belongs the large category of psychopathic individuals, and also the mental defectives. The discussion of the underlying psychological moments of each of these groups of individuals is comprised in an extensive literature. We will be concerned exclusively with the medico-legal relation of the latter group alone. In order to ascertain the degree of legal responsibility of mental defectives, it is necessary first to emphasize the characteristic clinical features of mental deficiency. In considering all varieties of deviation from normal in the psychic sphere we find a long scale beginning with mental monstrosities and ending with slight mental feebleness. When the intellectual powers are involved in their entirety we deal with idiocy. When the arrest of mental development is only incomplete and is, therefore, compatible with the existence of some intellectual manifestations, we deal with imbecility. There are also individuals in whom only certain powers are likely to reach a degree of development; in whom there is no general, but only partial defect of intellectual powers. For example, one will show a meager power of intellectual acquisition, in another the power of judgment is defective; another is incapable of acquiring ele-",

Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is the most common type, affecting about 30% of diabetic patients in hospital care and 25% of those in the community. Pain is the reason for 40% of patient visits in a primary care setting, and about 20% of these have had pain for greater than 6 months. Chronic pain may be nociceptive, which occurs as a result of disease or damage to tissue with no abnormality in the nervous system. In contrast, neuropathic pain is defined as \"pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.\" Persistent neuropathic pain interferes significantly with quality of life, impairing sleep and recreation; it also significantly impacts emotional well-being, and is associated with depression, anxiety, and noncompliance with treatment. Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a difficult-to-manage clinical problem, and patients with this condition are more apt to seek medical attention than those with other types of diabetic neuropathy. Early recognition of psychological problems is critical to the management of pain, and physicians need to go beyond the management of pain per se if they are to achieve success. This evidence-based review of the assessment of the patient with pain in diabetes addresses the state-of-the-art management of pain, recognizing all the conditions that produce pain in diabetes and the evidence in support of a variety of treatments currently available. A search of the full Medline database for the last 10 years was conducted in August 2012 using the terms painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, painful diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy, painful diabetic neuropathy and pain in diabetes. In addition, recent reviews addressing this issue were adopted as necessary. In particular, reports from the American Academy of Neurology and the Toronto Consensus Panel on Diabetic Neuropathy were included. Unfortunately, the results of evidence-based studies do not necessarily take into account the presence of comorbidities, the cost of treatment, or the role of third-party payers in decision-making. Thus, this review attempts to give a more balanced view of the management of pain in the diabetic patient with neuropathy and in particular the role of pregabalin.",

A wide range of psychiatric conditions are often comorbid with chronic pain and chronic pain conditions, negatively impacting successful treatment of either condition. The psychiatric condition receiving most attention in the past with regard to chronic pain comorbidity has been major depressive disorder, despite the fact that many other psychiatric conditions also demonstrate epidemiological and genetic overlap with chronic pain. Further understanding potential mechanisms involved in psychiatric and chronic pain comorbidity could lead to new treatment strategies both for each type of disorder in isolation and in scenarios of comorbidity.",

Tremor may be either physiologic or pathologic and can be classified as postural, rest and action tremors. This classification helps in determining the cause of tremor types. The most common disorders with tremor will be discussed in this review. Besides detailed questioning of the tremor; daily activities, drug, alcohol use and metabolic diseases should be asked while interviewing the patient. Physical examination should include careful inspection in different positions. Presence of other neurologic findings should also be checked for. Essential tremor is the most common tremor disorder, with a prevalence of 1-6 %. Mild and non-disability tremors don’t always warrant therapy. The treatment of tremor primarily involves pharmacotherapy. The most frequently used drugs are propranolol and primidon. If there is no history of alcohol and/or drug use in kinetic tremor, patients should be referred for evaluation of cerebral or cerebellar lesions. Management of tremor can be difficult because of different possible causes. However, differential diagnosis is possible with medical history and physical examination only. Therefore, detailed evaluation in primary care is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of tremor.",

PTSD is an anxiety disorder developed in a person experiencing, wit‐ nessing, or learning about an extreme physically or psychologically distressing event, asso‐ ciated with unprecedented violence [11, 12]. Traumatic events that can trigger PTSD include massacres, mass murder scenes, international, civil, political, ethnic and religious wars, gen‐ ocides, natural and man-made disasters, criminal assaults, serious accidents, terrorist at‐ tacks, incarceration, trafficking, rape and other types of sexual assaults [12-17], life threatening illness and the sudden death of a loved one, serious medical illness, injury, sur‐ gery, hostage, kidnapping, difficult labors, etc [18-20]. Individuals who experience a trauma of this nature may develop symptoms that fall into three distinct clusters: re-experiencing phenomenon; avoidance and numbing; and autonomic hyperarousal. Symptoms usually be‐ gin within the first 3 months after the traumatic event and last for many years, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before symptoms appear. PTSD patients are characterized by severe emotional state, sharp reduction in adaptive and information receiv‐ ing abilities. They usually remain out of society, become drug addicted, alcoholic and often commit suicide [21-24]. Degrees of risk to develop PTSD from different traumatic events are presented in table 1.",

      "abstract": "The problem of epilepsy may be best approached by considering all convulsions which are accompanied by unconsciousness, whether periodic or otherwise, as symptoms of some underlying pathologic state or disease.By doing this the convulsion becomes a symptom.The question then arises, which I believe should be answered in the negative, whether any so-called epileptic state should, of itself, be con- sidered a disease. ETIOLOGIC FACTORSThus, among the underlying causes of convulsions are uremia, eclampsia and other toxicoses; several varieties of trauma, as birth trauma and that from blows on the head; certain intracranial irrita- tions, as brain tumors and cerebral hemorrhages; certain infections, as syphilis and varieties of meningitis; certain conditions of cerebral maldevelopment accompanied by a degree of brain cell deterioration; and certain conditions of the pituitary gland causing a change in its secretion.I believe, therefore, that convulsions, whether periodical and termed epilepsy, or not, are due to definite pathologic cerebral tissue changes which may be congenital or induced, and hence, that epilepsy is an organic and not a functional condition.In the toxic and pituitary cases there may exist previous malformation and instability of the cortical cells, or, on the other hand, it is perfectly conceivable that the toxic substance or the changed pituitary secretion may produce their own cortical cell deterioration.I published a paper on the relation of the pituitary gland to some cases of epilepsy, and in 19141 and again in 1916,2 a paper on the subject of hypopituitarism in its relation to epilepsy.These papers were the result of a personal suggestion of Dr. Harvey Cushing and also of the perusal of his most excellent book.",

Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure.

In its etiology, cephalalgia can be primary, not associated with organic damage to tissues and organs, and secondary, which is based on pathological changes. In particular, cephalalgia in inflammatory lesions of the paranasal sinuses, brain tumors, encephalitis and meningitis, acute cerebrovascular accident, head trauma, arterial hypertension, aneurysm of the cerebral vessels, etc., should be attributed to the secondary headache. In 95–97 % of cases, the headache is not based on organic lesion, and in this case, the headache is primary. Primary cephalalgia can be based on both vegetative-vascular and metabolic-destructive changes. Primary headache can be noted with emotional or physical overstrain, exposure to a number of light, sound or olfactory stimuli, liquorodynamic or dysmetabolic disorders, when taking certain medications. Conventionally, primary headache can be divided into three groups — tension headache, migraine and cluster headache.",

These disorders reflect pathological processes in the central nervous system and are an important predictor of the social functioning recovery of patients. The question of the deficit structure remains open. In some cases, cognitive impairments are detected in early school age, in others, they appear only in adolescence. At the disease onset, there is a sharp deterioration in cognitive functioning. Further change is also heterogeneous: the same cognitive functions can either remain stable, or deteriorate or improve. To further study the cognitive deficit, it is necessary to distinguish more homogeneous groups based on both clinical parameters, and on the results of performing cognitive tests. It is important for the future of the concept of cognitive deficit to correlate it with the usual conceptualizations, including pathopsychological symptom groups.",

The connection between depression and alterations in gonadal function may have further psychophysiological implications.

Future studies using these constructs will be of use in further clarifying psychological and neuroendocrinological relationships.",

      "title": "Evaluación de funciones cognitivas: atención y memoria en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Evidence from recent studies about the epidemiology of panic disorder (PD) indicates that it is present in 4.7% of general population. In Mexico City, 2.9% of females and 1.9% of males are affected by this disease. Due to the incidence cited above, it is considered an important mental health problem that has impacted social, labor and familiar areas. On the other hand, PD is frequently present in comorbidity with other disorders like major depression, social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, in some cases, it may lead to a suicide risk. PD is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, and is commonly associated with agoraphobia. A panic attack is defined as a discrete period of fear or discomfort that includes physical, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Physical symptoms comprise short breath, palpitations, sweating, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort, and chest pain. Cognitive symptoms are associated with catastrophic interpretation of bodily sensations; behavioral symptoms are mainly avoidant of different places, situations and actions that patient had associated with fear of loss of control. In the past few years there has been a growing interest in the neuropsychology of anxiety disorders. Neuropsychological evaluation is relevant because it implies an objective assessment of the cognitive and behavioral abilities and weaknesses that make possible the prediction of the course of the disorder and the effects of treatment modalities. One of the most important contributions of neuropsychological evaluation is the identification of stable patterns of cognitive profiles of a specific disorder considered as neurocognitive endophenotypes. Some recent studies have demonstrated the relationship between neuropsychological alterations and anxiety; nevertheless, most of them were observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients. On the other hand, studies examining neuropsychological functioning in PD patients are scarce and report conflicting results. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether PD patients with and without agoraphobia, who attended the National Institute of Psychiatry «Ramon de la Fuente» in Mexico City, showed neuropsychological impairments relative to healthy controls in attention, memory and executive functions. We studied a total sample of 48 subjects (24 patients with PD, the patients sample was selected according to a psychiatric evaluation, based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Inclusion criteria were age between 19 and 56, men or women, without previous pharmacological or psychotherapeutically treatment; and 24 gender, age and education matched healthy control subjects). A neuropsychological test battery (Neuropsi Attention and Memory) in Spanish with norms by age and educational level was administered. The Neuropsi assesses orientation, attention and concentration, executive functions, working memory and immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory. Likewise, all patients were assessed with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Beck’s Anxiety Inventory and Panic Disorder Severity Scale. According to this psychometric evaluation, the PD patients showed severe anxiety, high anxiety sensitivity, as well as a severe degree of panic symptoms. The differences between PD patients and control subjects in neuropsychological performance were determined through one way analysis of variance (p<0.05) with the assistance of the SPSS 12. The results of the present study indicate that the neuropsychological test performance of patients with PD is diminished relative to that of the health control. According to obtained results, there were significant differences in the total score of executive functions and attention, memory and global attention and memory between patients and healthy controls. In the analysis of different subscales, it was found that patients had reduced performance in visual search, digit backward span, world list free recall, Rey-Ostereith Complex Figure Test encoding and retrieval, word list cued recall, faces retrieval and in diverse executive functions like category formation test, semantic and phonological verbal fluency, as well as design fluency. This suggests that PD is associated with alterations in tasks that require flexibility in the mental processes, short-term memory, working memory, and in the generation of strategies to solve problems. However, it is possible that these alterations were present before the onset of panic disorder and predispose the ulterior development of this disorder. In the visual detection subscale, that evaluates selective attention, there were also differences in latency of response because patients were slower than healthy controls trying to find the correct figure. This deficiency is associated with the difficulty of PD patients to perceive important details of the environment due to the extreme attention in the corporal sensations. Besides, no group differences were found in orientation, attention and concentration.",

      "abstract": "Pain that accompanies deafferentation is one of the most mysterious and misunderstood medical conditions. Prevalence rates for the assorted conditions vary considerably but the most reliable estimates are greater than 50% for strokes involving the somatosensory system, brachial plexus avulsions, spinal cord injury, and limb amputation, with controversy surrounding the mechanistic contributions of deafferentation to ensuing neuropathic pain syndromes. Deafferentation pain has also been described for loss of other body parts (e.g., eyes and breasts) and may contribute to between 10% and upwards of 30% of neuropathic symptoms in peripheral neuropathies. There is no pathognomonic test or sign to identify deafferentation pain, and part of the controversy surrounding it stems from the prodigious challenges in differentiating cause and effect. For example, it is unknown whether cortical reorganization causes pain or is a byproduct of pathoanatomical changes accompanying injury, including pain. Similarly, ascertaining whether deafferentation contributes to neuropathic pain, or whether concomitant injury to nerve fibers transmitting pain and touch sensation leads to a deafferentation-like phenotype can be clinically difficult, although a detailed neurologic examination, functional imaging, and psychophysical tests may provide clues. Due in part to the concurrent morbidities, the physical, psychologic, and by extension socioeconomic costs of disorders associated with deafferentation are higher than for other chronic pain conditions. Treatment is symptom-based, with evidence supporting first-line antineuropathic medications such as gabapentinoids and antidepressants. Studies examining noninvasive neuromodulation and virtual reality have yielded mixed results.",

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a rare condition, however its consequences might be devastating, since it affects patients’ physical function as well as psychological well-being. Therefore, it is not surprising for patients with SCI to develop mental health problems, such as depression and/or anxiety. Depressive symptoms include agitation, restlessness, fatigue, changes in appetite, helplessness, loss of interest as well as problems in sleeping. The presence of depression has been connected with extended length of hospitalization and development of secondary medical complications, as well as reduced quality of life (QOL) and self-efficacy. The purpose of this review is to investigate the existing literature to identify the effect of depression on hospitalization and rehabilitation in patients with SCI. From the 31 studies included in this paper, it is obvious that SCI patients with depression have longer periods of hospitalization and/or rehabilitation as well as worse functional outcomes. Moreover, it was shown that SCI individuals with depressive symptoms frequently develop other secondary medical complications which subsequently affect the length of stay and the rehabilitation outcomes. Acknowledging these facts can improve diagnosis and intervention, which may also improve the patient’s recovery outcome.",

From the frequency with which such histories are elicited,it appears that there is a strong congenital predisposition to the disease. Indeed, in quite a series of the cases herein reported, two, three, and even four members of a family have been afflicted with exophthalmic goiter. In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence. There are doubtless many thousands of individuals possessing a strong susceptibility to exophthalmic goiter who are going through life in an apparently normal manner, oblivious to possibilities which would likely follow the incidence of a psychic trauma.",

      "abstract": "In the perinatal period, fathers may also suffer from depression, referred to as paternal perinatal depression. Studies have shown that the prevalence of paternal perinatal depression is considerably higher than in the general adult population. For example, a meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression among fathers was 9.76% during the prenatal period and 8.75% during the postpartum year.1 Paternal perinatal depression can deteriorate the marital relationship and generate psychosocial and behavioral problems in the offspring (Ramchandani et al., 2021).2 However, paternal perinatal depression has received comparatively little clinical attention. A review of the literature on this subject will list the biological, psychological and social risk factors for this condition, which include a history of depression or anxiety disorders, lack of social support, conflicts in the couple's relationship, economic and labor problems. The clinical characteristics of depression share similarities with depressions in other periods of life, and there are differential clinical features, such as anger, aggressiveness, somatic symptoms and greater comorbidity with substance abuse disorder. Early detection with scales such as the Edinburgh, Gotland and PAPA and the appropriate approach are fundamental to mitigate the effects of paternal perinatal depression. Psychotherapeutic support, psychoeducation of the disorder, and self-care tools can be part of a comprehensive approach to help parents experiencing this condition. In conclusion, the proposal to include this disorder within the parental perinatal affective disorders, as proposed by the author Baldoni,3 given the level of overlap that it usually has with other comorbid conditions (anxiety, alcohol abuse, impulse control disorders) and high frequency of masked symptoms, goes in the direction to give the attention it deserves for early detection and provide adequate support and treatment.",

Psychological issues such as changes in behavior and mood following a concussion may emanate from micro-structural, connectivity, and metabolic changes to the brain following injury. In contrast, some patients may experience psychological responses to changes associated with their concussion such as disrupted schedules, social isolation, and frustration with longer than expected recovery. Sleep difficulties may be a symptom of or result in psychological issues following concussion. An emerging personality trait that may influence psychological responses to concussion and overall symptom burden following injury is somatization. Most concussion symptom inventories such as the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale include very few items that assess psychological symptoms such as anxiety, sadness, and irritability. Although licensed mental health professionals, such as psychologists and social workers, often provide the bulk of psychological care for athletes following a concussion, psychiatrists may also serve as a referral.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a ubiquitous term we use to refer to transient feelings of low mood or sadness that are occasional responses to the stresses of daily life. However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

The field is characterised by lively debates, including about the extent to which human suffering should be medicalised and the purportedly inflationary expansion of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses. The ICD-11 Working Group on this topic was asked to review scientific evidence and other information on use, clinical utility, and experience with relevant ICD-10 diagnoses in various health care settings; to review proposals for the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 and consider how these may be suited for global applications; and to assemble proposals for ICD-11 with a focus on improving clinical utility. The Working Group has recommended a separate grouping of 'Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress' for ICD-11, rather than combining them with anxiety disorders as in ICD-10 or DSM-IV. Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress have two key characteristics: 1) they are identifiable based on psychopathology that differs from other mental disorders; and 2) they arise in specific association with a stressful event or series of events. For each disorder in the grouping, the stressor is a necessary, though not sufficient, causal factor. The stressor may range from negative life events within the normal range of experience (in the case of adjustment disorder) to traumatic stressors of exceptional severity (in the case of PTSD and Complex PTSD).",

La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente. Non e necessariamente la stessa diagnosi dell’esame psichiatrico anamnestico prima del fatto e soprattutto non e necessariamente uguale alla diagnosi psichiatrica durante il fatto. Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc. In questo senso la diagnosi e la terapia (farmacologica o psicoterapica) sono di stretta competenza psichiatrica ed utili per la comprensione della criminalita ma non sufficienti perche non costituiscono gli unici fattori causali.",

When sufficiently intense and prolonged, the extreme physiological arousal pattern to stimulation that comprises emotional behavior produces pathological changes in physiological functioning and anatomic structure, which are psychophysiological and psychosomatic disorders. New stimuli may become associated with established autonomic reaction patterns that are emotional behavior; also particular autonomic reactions may be strengthened through differential reinforcement. Thus, emotional stimuli and emotional response patterns may be learned. When the emotional reaction patterns are sufficiently frequent or prolonged and sufficiently intense in the person socially prepared to react and physically predisposed (i.e., vulnerable via genetically determined or later acquired biological weakness), changes of such magnitude may occur in physiological functioning or anatomical structure as to be incompatible with continued life. Voodoo death corresponds to that formulation of psychosomatic death.",

U nezdrave oblike reakcije na traumu ubraja se i posttraumatski stresni poremecaj (PTSP) koji predstavlja anksiozni poremecaj ciji je razvoj povezan s traumatskim događajem. Kao i ostali stresom uzrokovani poremecaji uvelike utjece na opce zdravstveno stanje pojedinca i smanjenje njegove funkcionalnosti na socijalnom i radnom planu. Njegovo je osnovno obilježje razvoj karakteristicnih simptoma, kao odgovor na stresni događaj ili situaciju iznimno prijetece ili katastroficne naravi. Postaviti ispravnu dijagnozu posttraumatskog stresnog poremecaja u klinickom radu nije uvijek lako i jednostavno. Uzrok je tome cesto udruženi komorbiditet te cinjenica da se dijagnoza vecinom temelji na simptomima opisanim od bolesnika. Zbog toga se prilikom postavljanja dijagnoze PTSP-a, kao i bilo kojeg drugog psihickog poremecaja, treba služiti iscrpnim klinickim nalazom te primjenom razlicitih upitnika (testova), a dobivene podatke iskoristiti za izradu sto ucinkovitijeg terapijskog plana. Samo lijecenje, koje nije savrseno i ne znaci potpuni nestanak simptoma vec smanjenje njihove ucestalosti i intenziteta, potrebno je prilagoditi pojedincu kombiniranjem psihoterapijskih, psihofarmakoloskih i psihosocijalnih metoda. U ovom su radu prikazani postupci za dijagnozu PTSP-a, odnosno dijagnosticki kriteriji i metode kao i diferencijalna dijagnostika te lijecenje PTSP-a, odnosno tri važna aspekta koja to lijecenje obuhvacaju: edukacija, psihosocijalna i psihoterapijska podrska i/ili lijecenje i primjena psihofarmakoloskih metoda lijecenja.",

Стрілецький спорт можна вважати радше статичним, а не динамічним видом спорту, де динаміка присутня, але, на відмінну від таких видів спорту, як біатлон, вона у рази менша. Проблему неспецифічного болю у спині спортсменів-стрільців вивчено недостатньо, є велика кількість причин через виникнення болю – від генетично успадкованих захворювань до того, що спортсмен змінив поставу заради досягнення більш кращого результату. Це дослідження було спрямоване на вивчення впливу неспецифічного болю не тільки на результати на змаганнях, а і на життя спортсмена в цілому. Неспецифічний біль у спині є багатофакторною проблемою, яку потрібно розглядати в широкому аспекті, бо, окрім успадкованих захворювань, порушення постави може виникати і через тривалий стрес, через низькі результати на змаганнях або завеликий об’єм тренувальної діяльності. Будь-який з цих аспектів може впливати на виникнення неспецифічного болю у спині. Було проведене опитування спортсменів, щоб дізнатись, наскільки сильно впливає неспецифічний біль у спині на тренувальну діяльність та життя спортсмена. Мета та завдання – проаналізувати стан спортсменів-стрільців з проявами неспецифічного болю у спині за допомогою сучасних наукових досліджень. Методи дослідження. Проведено опитування спортсменів-стрільців різних спортивних звань з неспецифічним болем у спині. Результати дослідження. Провівши опитування двадцяти шести спортсменів з приводу неспецифічного болю у спині, ми визначили, що це одна із основних проблем, яка заважає отримувати високі результати на змаганнях. Висновки. Аналіз даних показує, що досить багато спортсменів-стрільців має проблеми з неспецифічним болем у спині. Така проблема потребує вирішення. Необхідне подальше надання допомоги спортсменам задля того, щоб спортсмени могли у майбутньому показували більш якісні результати і мали більше можливостей для продовження тренування та вдосконалення їх навичок.

Naturally, chronic pain can present occasions when patients feel misunderstood or mistreated, feel threatened by poor health, experience interference with normal daily functioning, take medications that can produce side effects, and experience depression and anxiety. When chronic pain leads to painful emotions, memories, and other unwanted experiences, the pain sufferer will naturally attempt to avoid these as well. On the level of human experience, chronic pain brings loss, threats, uncertainty, restraint, apparent mistreatment, and failure into the lives of those who suffer with it. Chronic pain is possibly not best understood as a symptom or condition of the body that results in effects on the person and their functioning. The behavior of the individual pain sufferer, interacting with and in a broader psychological context, is an indivisible whole.",

      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

The otological pathology in the former case is useful for investigating the internal pathology and sometimes for delivering correct diagnosis. On the contrary, in the latter case, it does not offer elements for any etiopathogenic hypothesis because it happens in almost all cases with an acute onset in an otherwise healthy subject and it is always underestimated because of the minor functional impairment. However, clinical studies in the last years led to a significant evolution of otological findings as an early important symptom in the etiopathogenic study and in the diagnosis of some internal diseases.

It not as it were obscures one's viewpoint, it is commonly checked by rest issues and changes in vitality levels and craving. It changes the structure and work of nerve cells so that it disturbs the way the brain forms data and deciphers involvement. In spite of sentiments of sadness and worthlessness, depression could be a treatable condition. It can be treated with psychotherapy or medicine, or a combination of both. Depression is a common condition in modern life. According to the National Institutes of Health, each year more than 16 million adults in the United States experience at least one episode of major depression. The likelihood that a person will develop depression at some point in life is approximately 10 percent. Prolonged social stress and major disruption of social ties are known risk factors for depression, and major negative life events such as loss of a loved one, or loss of a job, increase the subsequent risk of depression. Significant adversity early in life, such as separation from parents or parental neglect or abuse, may create vulnerability to major depression later in life by setting the nervous system to over-respond to stress.",

      "abstract": "An episode of transient global amnesia is characterized by a sudden loss of the ability to retain new information. Transient global amnesia is sometimes precipitated by a psychological or physiological stress. Transient global amnesia also must be distinguished from psychogenic amnesia and from factitious amnesia. Usually no physical symptoms are associated with transient global amnesia. Any physical symptoms should raise the possibility of an alternative etiology for the patient's amnesia. The characteristic presentation of transient global amnesia is a sudden loss of ability to form new memories. Patients who develop transient global amnesia generally are taken by companions to an emergency room. Neuropsychological testing after multiple attacks may reveal more memory impairment as well as visuoperceptual deficits. Transient global amnesia is rare in young or middle-age adults. It is relatively common in individuals who are over 50 years old.",

      "abstract": "In legal practice it is assumed that the ordinary man intends the natural consequences of his acts. When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

      "abstract": "Tremor is the most common involuntary movement disorder. It can be an isolated symptom or a symptom of another neurological disorder, such as dystonia, Parkinson disease, spinocerebellar ataxia et al. It is an unintentional, somewhat rhythmic, muscle movement involving to-and-fro movements of one or more parts of the body. It can affect the hands, arms, head, vocal cord, jaw, chin, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. Clinically, the most useful way to categorized tremor is whether it occurs mainly at rest, on postural, or during movement (kinetic tremor). Tremor is most common classified by different clinical features and cause or origin; include essential tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, cerebellar tremor, dystonic tremor, orthostatic tremor, physiologic tremor, and psychogenic tremor. Diagnosis need a detail history (include familial inheritance, drugs exposure, alcohol consumption or withdraw); complete physical examination and laboratory tests. Electromyography is also a simple and quick method with which to calculate tremor frequency and amplitude for assisting diagnosis. Treatment for majority of tremor syndrome is purely symptomatic, and is similar regardless of the underlying cause of the tremor. There are different medicines to try in order propranolol, clonazepam, primidome and gabapentin for limb tremors, or trihexyphenidyl for dystonic tremor. Focal botulinum toxin injection may be help in focal tremor. Neurosurgery is only indicated in severe tremor, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subthalamic nucleus for primary or secondary parkinsonian tremor.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common yet poorly understood functional bowel disorder. A multi-factorial aetiology has been proposed, and abnormalities in colonic motility, small bowel motility and visceral sensation have been observed experimentally. More recently, attention has turned to a quite distinct abnormality, namely psychological function. Studies have shown that for a significant proportion of the IBS population, co-morbid psychiatric disturbance may be aetiopathological, with the physical abnormalities described occurring in response to stress or anxiety induced experimentally. Others have suggested that psychological distress may occur as a result of severe gastrointestinal symptoms, and that psychosocial factors may be related to the presentation rather than genesis of the symptoms. Many of these studies contain methodological inadequacies which may adversely affect the results obtained. Comparison between studies, which may provide further insight, is often difficult due to inconsistencies in the experimental protocol and the non-standard ways in which data have been presented. It is likely, however, that differences between methodologies may, in part, explain the variations in results between studies.",

      "abstract": "Neurological outcome after preterm birth refers to neurologically defined conditions due to disorders of the motor system – e.g. spasticity, dyskinesia or ataxia – which are commonly summarized under the term “cerebral palsy” (CP). Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW. This means that CP following preterm birth, or brain compromise affecting the motor system, is probably related to a pathomechanism specifically affecting the immature brain, which stresses the importance of gaining insight into the following questions:",

The most common findings in patients with spinal emergencies are pain, motor deficits, sensory deficits, abnormal reflexes, and urinary dysfunction. Acute back pain is the only symptom of catastrophic spinal emergencies such as spinal hemorrhage or infection. Sudden paralysis can result from trauma, cord infarction, or hemorrhage. Even though a thorough sensory examination in the emergency department is often difficult and unreliable, complexes of sensory and motor abnormalities are helpful. As a result of the anatomical distribution of upper and lower motor neurons, acute spinal cord lesions almost always present with hyperreflexia. The mechanism of urinary incontinence depends on the type of lesion. Spinal cord emergencies frequently go unrecognized initially or are misdiagnosed even with such obvious symptoms as the inability to walk or bladder function failure.",

      "abstract": "Pendidikan kedokteran merupakan jurusan akademik yang sangat diminati dan ditargetkan oleh banyak kalangan. Namun, dalam proses pembelajarannya, seorang mahasiswa kedokteran harus menghadapi berbagai tuntutan akademik yang berat dan dapat menyebabkan kesehatan mentalnya terganggu. Gangguan kesehatan mental merupakan kondisi seseorang mengalami gangguan psikologis sehingga menyebabkan perubahan negatif pada kesejahteraan hidup, fisiologis kejiwaan, dan kecakapan hidup. Beberapa contoh gangguan ini adalah perasaan stres, cemas, dan depresi. Stres merupakan reaksi tertekan pada tubuh terhadap besarnya tuntutan dan kewajiban yang harus dilakukan dalam waktu tertentu. Cemas adalah kondisi seseorang yang merasa gelisah, takut, dan khawatir yang terlalu berlebihan terhadap masa depan. Depresi merupakan kondisi berkurangnya energi tubuh, berkurangnya minat dalam menjalankan aktivitas sehari-hari, serta perasaan sedih yang berkepanjangan. Segala stresor yang menyebabkan gangguan kesehatan mental ini tidak hanya didapatkan dari proses pembelajaran, namun juga didapatkan dari kondisi eksternal, seperti tekanan dari teman sejawat, finansial, dan keluarga. Gangguan kesehatan mental mampu memberikan pengaruh besar bagi mahasiswa kedokteran dalam melaksanakan aktivitas perkuliahannya, salah satunya adalah pengaruhnya terhadap hasil Uji Kompetensi Mahasiswa Program Profesi Dokter (UKMPPD). UKMPPD merupakan exit exam nasional bagi mahasiswa program profesi dokter yang harus diambil sebelum mengangkat sumpah dokter, ujian ini terdiri atas Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) dan Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Kondisi mental yang tidak sehat berpengaruh pada kinerja mahasiswa dalam menganalisis setiap materi yang akan dipelajari. Besarnya beban mental yang ditampung mahasiswa akan membuat diri mereka tidak fokus untuk mempelajari materi secara terstruktur sehingga tidak semua materi dapat dipelajari dengan baik. Hal ini bermuara pada hasil UKMPPD yang tidak optimal.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "El trastorno por consumo de alcohol consiste en un patrón desadaptativo de consumo de la sustancia que conlleva un deterioro o malestar clínicamente significativo, un período continuado de 12 meses. Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

An important aspect of pain is nociception, a complex series of electrochemical events that involves activation of specialized neural pathways in response to (potentially) tissue-damaging stimuli. Clinically, the degree of nociception is manifested as signs of tissue damage. Pain, in contrast to nociception, is a subjective experience that may involve stimulus-induced activation of afferent neural pathways or other components, such as somatosensory processing or psychosocial factors. Reflex responses to nociceptive stimulation can be described as suprasegmental or cortical and spinal or segmental. Spinal reflexes are generated by nociceptive signals being transmitted through the dorsal horn to somatomotor or autonomic neurons at various spinal levels, resulting in responses such as paralytic ileus, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, or muscle spasm. Suprasegmental reflexes are propagated via the ascending pathways to the brain stem, hypothalamus, and cortex, where withdrawal reflexes and autonomic responses are generated.",

For example, the individual nervous and mental phenomena that so frequently appear as an aftermath to brain injury have been attributed by some to generalized gliosis or to other diffuse tissue change. To the contrary, there are others who believe that such manifestations are to be explained largely on a functional basis. Is the solution of the problem to be sought in histologic studies? Can sufficient alterations be found in the various cellular elements to account for immediate as well as remote symptoms? What alterations take place in these cells, and what is their significance?

Worldwide, depression is a major cause of disability and premature death. Unipolar depression is commonly (about 75% of cases) non-familial, clearly associated with stressful life-events and accompanied by symptoms of anxiety and agitation; this type is sometimes termed reactive depression. Other patients (about 25%, sometimes termed endogenous depression) show a familial pattern, unrelated to external stresses, and with a somewhat different symptomatology. This distinction is made clinically, but there is little evidence that antidepressant drugs show significant selectivity between these conditions.",

Hypnosis inappropriately or ineptly applied, with suggestions that do not take into account the subject's psychological state or vulnerabilities, can result in short and long term deleterious effects. These adverse effects result more from a lack of psychological understanding of the practitioner and the particular vulnerabilities of the patient rather than being dangers of the hypnotic state or process. A lack of appropriate therapist training in hypnosis and hypnotically- based therapy, inadequate understanding of the subject or patient and the pathological psychological processes, and the processes of psychotherapy and the hypnotic process itself, increases the risk of adverse effects.",

Every strongly relevant individual concern, like fears, can yield cognitive bias or \"cognitive-emotional sensitization\". It might also be present for bodily and environmental information related to illness, and could be an etiological factor in medically unexplained complaints. Physiological and cognitive sensitization are theoretically compared. There is evidence for cognitive-emotional sensitization in some medically unexplained somatic complaints, and negative affect is suggested as a catalyst. Prolonged cognitive-emotional sensitization (\"perseverative negative cognition\" or worry, rumination) might even have demonstrable somatic pathological effects. It is concluded that sensitization may be organized at different levels, both in the organism and in the larger living system within which the organism is subsumed. This view might not only help to clarify medically unexplained pain syndromes, but virtually every subjective complaint, both with and without recognized physiopathology.",

One type of self-reported posttraumatic illness known as chemosensory dysfunction occurs in as many as 24.5% of head trauma victims. Ferreting out individuals pretending to have chemosensory dysfunction as part of litigation for economic gain is a clinical dilemma requiring a multimodal approach. This includes evaluation of historical context, complaints, physical examination findings, chemosensory testing, psychiatric evaluation, and ancillary testing. Long-standing chemosensory complaints seemingly produce or exacerbate psychiatric problems in various ways. As chemosensory problems persist over time, patients may become pessimistic about an eventual recovery and this may lead to depression. Historical clues indicating malingering also include complaints of trauma-induced absolute loss of chemosensory ability. Consistent with his physical findings, both first taste and temporal summation indicate problems within the chemosensory system.",

Although those who suffer from chronic pain also tend to associate the onset with an injury, illness, or surgical procedure; the root cause is far more complex. Chronic pain most often does not follow dermatomal distributions associated with any injury, disease or surgical procedure. And more often than not, chronic pain sufferers also suffer from various forms of depression and/or anxiety. The process of central sensitization resulting from tissue injury has been elucidated, as has many of the molecular changes within the brain that perpetuate chronic pain. Genetics, epigenetics, environmental stressors, and emotional stressors all play roles to varying degrees in the development of the chronic pain state. This article explores how synaptic memories form in the brain as a result of both physical and emotional traumas (multiple hits) resulting in progression to chronic pain, because of failure of the brain’s descending modulatory mechanisms to prevent or control “the pain”.",

CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia. O enfoque do tratamento fonoaudiológico é a mioterapia dos músculos envolvidos, priorizando a musculatura palatal.

In panic disorder, panic attacks often occur at unpredictable times, making it difficult to study these episodes in the laboratory. In specific phobias, symptoms occur in very circumscribed situations and specific triggers are sometimes difficult to reproduce in the laboratory. Ambulatory assessment, or ecological momentary assessment, can further the understanding of the natural course and scope of symptoms under ecologically valid circumstances. Because bodily symptoms are integral to the diagnosis of anxiety disorders, the objective assessment of physiological responses in the patients' natural environment is particularly important. On the one hand, research has highlighted intriguing discrepancies between the experience of symptoms and physiology during panic attacks. On the other hand, it has validated symptom reporting during therapeutic exposure to phobic situations. Therefore, ambulatory assessment can yield useful information about the psychopathology of anxiety disorders, and it can be used to monitor change during clinical interventions.",

Los criterios para su diagnostico se basan en el consenso de Roma llamados “criterios de Roma II” que a su vez se basan en Los criterios de Manning. Estos criterios se basan unicamente en los sintomas, excluyendo los estudios paraclinicos enfermedades organicas. Se trata de un desorden biopsicosocial en el cual interactuan tres mecanismos mayores: Factores psicologicos, motilidad alterada y un aumento de la sensibilidad visceral.",

      "abstract": "Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a disorder that develops in the context of a brain injury or underlying neurological dysfunction. It is characterized as an affective disorder of emotional expression. PBA manifests as frequent uncontrollable outbursts of laughing or crying, incongruent with the individual's internal emotional state. It can be challenging for clinicians to differentiate PBA from mood disorders, contributing to its high rate of misdiagnosis. This lack of recognition leads to ineffective and insufficient treatment, impacting patients' quality of life. The current article provides an overview of PBA, including its history, prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical implications, and treatment.

      "title": "Psychologically determined disorders",
      "abstract": "Neurologists frequently see patients with symptoms or inconsistent signs that are not explicable in terms of any recognized neurological disease process. Often it is clear that such symptoms and signs are being manufactured psychologically, either consciously or, more often, by an unconscious process. Such patients are frequently polysymptomatic, and may have a long history of consulting other specialists, particularly abdominal, dental, gynaecological, and otorhinological surgeons. They run the risk of developing secondary abnormalities induced by surgical and other invasive procedures. Psychologically determined symptoms are a very common cause of neurological out-patient referral. Of those with psychogenic disorders, pain is the commonest symptom, followed by motor symptoms, gait disturbances, dizziness, blackouts, sensory symptoms, and visual dysfunction (Lempert et al. 1990). Depressive and anxiety disorders are twice as common in those with psychologically determined disorders and those with emotional disorders have a greater number of somatic symptoms but are unenthusiastic about psychiatric treatment. Clinical syndromes including Briquet’s syndrome, hypochondriasis, conversion disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and pain disorders are explained and described. The presentation and characteristics of malingering (a process of deliberate deceit, in which symptoms are fabricated) is described, including Munchausen’s syndrome. In addition, associated psychiatric states and the symptoms and physical signs of psychologically determined disorders are discussed. Finally, the management and prognosis of psychologically determined states are outlined.",

      "title": "Diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder in Children",
      "abstract": "As a symptom state, nearly all humans have personal experience with the feeling of social anxiety. For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

There is also the risk that the \"functional\" diagnosis masks - as prejudice - lesional pathologies not adequately investigated with the available technology, leading to serious clinical errors. Moreover, even in presence of a probable psychogenic disorder, patients tend to reject the \"functional\" diagnosis, for cultural reasons linked to the old philosophical separation between diseases of the body and mind (the latter with a \"lower\" status). The current evolution of neuroscience should lead us to the conclusion that all so-called \"functional\" disorders are manifestations of cerebral suffering; at the same time an existential approach to the disease must make us wary of reductionist conclusions, because the clinical expression of a lesion is in the great majority of cases modulated by the culture and the history of the patient.",

Sport transitions may be accompanied by changes in identity, interpersonal relationships, schedules, and behavioural changes. Psychosocial outcomes following sport retirement can be broadly differentiated between acute psychological distress, mental health disorders, and healthy adjustment. Acute psychological distress following sport retirement may be best understood in the context of stressful life events. Stressful life events, such as job transitions and family conflict, have been shown to predict the onset of mental health concerns, such as depression. Sport retirement is a significant life event, and negative emotions are a common response to the transition. Adjustment disorder is characterised by the onset of emotional or behavioural symptoms within three months of an identifiable stressor and does not persist past six months after termination of the stressor.",

Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

Dichos sintomas varian desde la ansiedad e irritabilidad moderadas, hasta la depresion severa. Es frecuente que los sintomas premenstruales sean una exacerbacion de los sintomas de tipo ansioso y depresivo que estan presentes a lo largo de todo el ciclo, pero esta no es una regla. En el presente trabajo se discuten algunas hipotesis que se han emitido acerca de la relacion que existe entre los neurotransmisores, las hormonas gonadales y la depresion. Se han ensayado diversos tratamientos para el SPM, especialmente el hormonal y el psicofarmacologico. Con respecto al tratamiento hormonal, los reportes son contradictorios. Esto se puede deber a que no se ha podido demostrar que haya una anomalia hormonal simple en la etiologia del SPM. Parece mas acertada la idea de que los sintomas del SPM sean consecuencia de algunos cambios aun desconocidos en la interaccion funcional que hay entre las hormonas gonadales y los neurotransmisores cerebrales. Es por ello que los resultados del tratamiento del SPM con psicofarmacos son mas alentadores, particularmente con algunos derivados de las dibenzodiacepinas. Esto hace suponer que el control del estado ansioso/depresivo que aparece en el SPM, junto con el control del dolor periferico asociado, constituye el modelo terapeutico mas racional.",

It must be appreciated however, that the aetiology of impotence in diabetes can be due to a variety of factors that cover the whole spectrum of impotence. The problem may be primarily neurogenic, vasculogenic or a combination of these factors. In addition, impotence in the diabetic may be contributed to or caused by diuretic or antihypertensive medication, a penile abnormality such as Peyronie's disease or be purely psychogenic. Whatever the possible organic basis for the problem, an additional psychogenic overlay is likely. It is apparent therefore that a comprehensive medical history and specific detailed psychosexual history are required, together with a relevant clinical examination and screening before a likely cause or causes can be identified and appropriate treatment instituted. This cannot readily be undertaken in a busy outpatient department and time must be made available for the impotent patient to be comprehensively counselled in a specially designated clinic.",

Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.\n\nLike seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.\n\nSeizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.\n\nBHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, …",

      "abstract": "Headache is an exceedingly common symptom following concussion, and post-traumatic headache may evolve into a persistent post-concussion manifestation. Migraine and post-traumatic headache share similar pathophysiologic mechanisms, and both can considerably decrease quality of life. The development of post-traumatic headache or post-traumatic migraine must be differentiated from concussion, and requires specific management to address headache manifestations. Although there are no approved pharmacologic treatments specific to post-traumatic headache, emerging strategies focus on treatment paradigms similar to migraine management. Failure to address post-traumatic headache and post-traumatic migraine will lead to prolonged post-concussive symptoms and the misunderstanding that such prolonged symptoms are a result of incomplete recovery from concussion.",

When there are evidences of associated functional disturbances in other organ systems or in the patient as a whole, or characteristic clinical syndromes are present, and there is lack of symptomatic or objective evidence of organic disease on careful examination, the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely. Treatment of functional gastrointestinal disturbances rests fundamentally on the art of medicine in the treatment of the patient and not on the science of medicine in the treatment of a disease. The essential steps in successful treatment include convincing the patient of the diagnosis, improving and relieving symptoms and avoiding or adequately controlling recurrences.Psychotherapy is a keystone in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Not often, however, are the services of a psychiatrist necessary. Given, as needed, mild sedatives, certain forms of specific treatment in specific conditions, general measures and good hygiene and sympathetic understanding, the patient may be expected to recover or improve.",

Functional disorders can present with various symptoms. Common forms of functional disorders include functional neurologic symptom disorder (also referred to as “conversion disorder”), functional gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain syndromes, and chronic fatigue. One-third to one-half of outpatient consultations in many practices are due to functional disorders. Functional disorders must be distinguished from structural and psychiatric disorders but should not be considered diagnoses of exclusion. Recovery is facilitated by good relationships between patients and practitioners, with good explanations of the pathophysiology of functional disorders and effective encouragement and education of patients.",

This case describes the diagnostic dilemma presented by a patient with diabetes and a history of severe hypoglycemia complicated by other medical, psychiatric, social, and functional problems.\n\nCognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, increased distractibility, and confusion) can present a difficult diagnostic problem for clinicians because it can be symptomatic of many underlying and undetected clinical conditions. Careful diagnosis is crucial because some causes may be progressive and irreversible, whereas other causes may be reversible with medical or psychiatric treatment. Some of the more noteworthy causes are related to medication, alcohol, aging, depression, and, as in this case study, the possible consequences of recurrent severe hypoglycemia related to diabetes.1 Diabetes, of course, may cause an increase in cognitive decline over the course of time because of vascular risk factors.2 Some evidence suggests that acute hyperglycemia may have a negative impact on cognitive performance.3\n\nDepression is the most common of the reversible causes of memory impairment, and people with diabetes are twice as likely to suffer from depression as those without diabetes.4 Recent evidence suggests that diabetes may create alterations in regions of the brain that are associated with affect regulation and increase the risk for developing a depressive disorder.5 Fortunately, problematic medications can be modified, and alcohol misuse or depression can be treated. Unfortunately, despite its relevance to the course of diabetes, depression is recognized and treated in fewer than one-third of people with diabetes.4\n\nThe relationship between recurrent severe hypoglycemia and cognitive impairment remains unclear.

      "abstract": "The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is one of the main causes of neurodegenerative dementias in adults. Patients present with an early decline in social conduct, impaired regulation of interpersonal conduct, apathy, emotional blunting, and general loss of insight. However, symptoms are highly variable among patients, leading to misdiagnosis or diagnosis delay in particular when psychiatric symptoms are prominent at the onset of the disease. More specifically, personality disorders have been described as either a risk factor for misdiagnosis or as part of the bvFTD phenotype.\r\n\r\nHere we report the case of a 52-year-old woman, born from consanguineous parents and with a family history of early-onset dementia, who was first diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria. Nonetheless, atypical symptoms such as apathy, disinhibition, hyperorality, depressive symptoms and psychotic manifestations were described.The clinical exam revealed a frontal lobe dysfunction, along with severe cognitive impairment as revealed by the neuropsychological assessment (alteration of facial emotion recognition and theory of mind, with a relative sparing of executive and instrumental functions). Brain imaging revealed atrophy of frontal lobes and right hemisphere, and a hypometabolism of the right frontotemporal lobe.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the clinical presentation and her family history, screening for hereditary diseases was performed, revealing a heterozygous mutation of PGRN gene. The diagnosis of bvFTD with progranulin mutation was finally made. This case highlights for the first time a diagnosis of bvFTD associated with a progranulin mutation and a history of late-labeled histrionic personality disorder. It emphasizes the need to actively seek frontal symptoms and consider PGRN mutation in late-labelled patients with personality disorders with a family history of neurodegenerative disorders.",

En los TP, la farmacoterapia se utiliza para tratar aspectos específicos, como son los síntomas cognitivos perceptuales, afectivos o los derivados de la impulsividad. Debido a que es un fenómeno polimórfico, se utilizan diferentes tipos de psicofármacos, como por ejemplo, antipsicóticos, antidepresivos o estabilizadores del ánimo. Ha habido pocos intentos sistemáticos de validar los actuales algoritmos de tratamiento de los trastornos de personalidad severos.

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are more prevalent than any other mental health problem in the USA, but afflicted patients are often untreated or treated only by a primary care physician. Anxiety disorders can be understood in the context of the interplay of biological, psychosocial, and behavioral factors. Psychiatry has defined effective treatment that integrates education, psychotherapy and psychopharmacology. A combination of treatment approaches may be beneficial. Anxiety related symptoms, other than a true anxiety disorder, may be precipitated by normal stresses of daily life. These patients may also benefit from treatments used in anxiety disorders. Anxiety can also occur secondary to medical disorders and medications, as well as being present as part of other psychiatric syndromes. Diagnosis requires a history, physical examination and laboratory tests. Anxiety disorders, although common, are easily overlooked because patients may present with somatic complaints rather than admit to having emotional problems. Anxiety disorders are divided into seven categories in DSM IV, with each allowing for a differential treatment approach. Non-pharmacological treatments are the first line of treatment, and may include behavior therapy and cognitive therapy. The physician-patient relationship is itself a powerful treatment tool. Key areas in which the psychiatrist can help the patient cope are outlined. Benefits and risks of drug treatment for anxiety disorders are discussed.",

Emotional disturbances may mask these subtle problems, but they can also result from them. Clinical experience indicates that these problems are more apt to become stressful when the patient misinterprets or copes ineffectively with them. That these common problems of brain injured adults may be overlooked in the usual clinical examination was shown in a comparison of clinical records of 50 patients referred for neuropsychological consultation with records of 46 patient-participants in a longitudinal neuropsychological study. Significantly more reports of these problems appeared in the latter group of records. However, consultation records did reflect emotional distress. Irritability, depression, or anxiety affected all but six consultation patients and appeared with equal frequency among working patients as among those unable to work or needing full-time care. This suggests that some of their emotional distress resulted from less obvious problems than those impairing mobility, strength, or competency. Counseling can reduce the patient's vulnerability to the psychologically crippling effects of perplexity, distractibility, and fatigue.

      "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders are one of the most common causes of sleep-related complaints, especially insomnia. Sleep impairment may be a result of central nervous system abnormalities associated with psychiatric conditions, as well as of associated behavioral disturbances. Although sleep patterns are not diagnostic of psychiatric disorders, there are relationships. This chapter reviews the sleep disturbances associated with psychiatric diseases and their general assessment and management. Major psychiatric diseases share similar structural and biochemical abnormalities with the sleep regulation system. Sleep disturbance is associated with many psychiatric illnesses and in fact predates the manifestations of psychiatric illness. Pharmacologic management of psychiatric conditions also affects sleep. Psychiatric conditions and sleep have bilateral mutual relationships in terms of the worsening or improvement of symptoms. Obviously when these two groups of conditions share the basic substrate, their manifestations are naturally overlapping and can cause difficulty in establishing an accurate diagnosis.",

Whereas most symptoms of the initial prodromal condition appear to be rather un-specific and hard to distinguish from other psychiatric conditions especially depressive ones, some syndromes seem to enable an early detection and thus an indicated prevention. These are constituted by attenuated and/or transient psychotic symptoms on the one hand and certain cognitive–perceptive basic symptoms on the other. Whereas the former are thought to delineate an advanced prodromal state, the latter can occur early in course and even at the beginning of the transition sequence to first-rank symptoms. This review will outline the current state of the art of a phase specific early detection and intervention based on these syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depressive illness in the elderly may be the result of a physical illness, the cause of secondary physical problems, coincidental tophysical illness or the result of an aetiological factor common to both conditions. Analysis of a cross‐sectional community sample of 396 elderly people showed depression to be significantly linked to presence of headaches, dyspnoea, and malignant disease known to the patient. It was not linked with heart disease nor arthritis per se , although those on anti‐arthritic or analgesic medication were significantly more depressed. The subjective description of physical health given by the patient also correlated strongly with depression. Depressive illness is sometimes unrecognized and frequently untreated with a consequent reduction in quality of life for many patients. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility that depression may coexist with physical illness, and that both conditions may need appropriate treatment. Further analysis of the above sample, controlling for physical illness and the additive effect of the variables concerned, showed depression to be positively correlated with adverse social factors such as not going out because of physical disability, feeling lonely, having a shopper and having hearing difficulties. The home help service was identified as a probable protective factor, implying the importance of this service in supporting the emotional as well as the physical needs of its clients.",

      "abstract": "Non-organic voice disorders are characterised by an impaired voice sound, and/or reduced vocal capacity, and/or laryngeal sensory disturbances, all in the absence of causal organic laryngeal pathology. Psychogenic causes, a \"psychological disequilibrium\", and an increased tension of the laryngeal muscles are presumed to be one end of the spectrum of possible factors leading to the development of the disorder. In making a diagnosis, perceptive and acoustic methods for voice analysis are used in addition to the ENT-examination and the laryngostroboscopy. An assessment of the degree to which the patient feels him/herself subjectively affected by the voice disorder also plays an important role. If the history reveals any indication of psychosocial stress or conflict, the patient is offered psychological consultations. These conflicts seem less often to be deep rooted psychopathological problems but rather daily anxieties, failures, injuries, annoyances, disappointments regarding the sufferer him/herself and others, the non-fulfillment of desires, feelings of inadequacy and of lack of self-confidence. The patients may find it difficult to speak about conflicts and feelings, and they follow social conventions to an excessive extent. In frustrating situations patients tend to react aggressively towards themselves rather than towards others and are too quick in seeking a solution to any problem that may arise. The role of the voice as a \"barometer of emotion\", where a disorder may be regarded as a sign of emotional stress, has to be taken into consideration before starting a therapy: If the non-organic voice disorder is obviously due to vocal misuse and muscle tension, a more symptom-orientated voice therapy may be favoured. If psychosocial stress seems to play a greater role, additional counseling may be necessary. Only by using this approach can the patient be offered a therapy which goes into the causes and thereby addresses the whole person.",

      "abstract": "Introducao: A distonia e uma sindrome de contracoes musculares sustentadas involuntarias que produzem sempre movimentos repetitivos e contorcidos ou posturas anormais. Dentre todos os disturbios do movimento associados a disfuncao dos nucleos da base, a distonia e a menos compreendida em relacao a sua fisiopatologia. Recentestrabalhos revelaram que o circuito motor nucleos da base cortico-estriado-talamocortical apresenta um importante papel nas funcoes cognitivas nao-motoras, particularmente na discriminacao temporal e espacial e na integracao multisensorial. O limiar de discriminacao espacial foi encontrado anormal em pacientes com distonia focal nas maos, distonia cervical e blefaroespasmo. Um fenomeno distinto em distonia e o truque sensorial (ou geste antagonistique). Os truques sensoriais sao geralmentemanobras tateis ou de outra natureza sensorial envolvendo o lado afetado ou nao, que reduzem os movimentos e posturas distonicas. O espasmo hemifacial e uma doenca neurologica com caracteristicas fenomenologicas semelhantes a distonia, porem o espasmo hemifacial e uma forma de mioclonia de origem periferica com contracoesmusculares involuntarias e unilateriais clonicas e tonicas dos musculos inervados pelo nervo facial ipsilateral. Objetivo: verificar a frequencia e a caracterizacao clinica dos truques sensoriais em diferentes tipos de distonia e no espasmo hemifacial, bem como determinar mudancas na sensibilidade espacial durante a realizacao do Grating Orientation Task e correlaciona-las com os truques sensoriais. Amostra e metodos: Osvoluntarios foram recrutados da Clinica Disturbios do Movimento - Ambulatorio Bias Fortes UFMG. Participaram da pesquisa individuos de ambos os sexos, diagnosticados com distonia (exceto a distonia heredo-degenerativa) do tipo blefaroespasmo (n=20), distonia cervical (21) e caibra do escrivao (10) ou espasmo hemifacial (26). Osvoluntarios foram avaliados por uma estudante de mestrado que aplicou um questionario e o Mini Exame do Estado Mental, bem como avaliou a sensibilidade espacial atraves do Grating Orientation Task. Resultados: A presenca do truque sensorial foi maior na distonia cervical (81%) quando comparada ao grupo espasmo hemifacial (38,5%) p= 0,004 e ao grupo câimbra do escrivao (20%), p= 0,001. A sensibilidade espacial da mao dominante dos sujeitos que apresentam o truque sensorial foi significativamente maior que daqueles sujeitos que nao apresentam otruque sensorial (p=0,019;p<0,050). Conclusoes: Mais de 1/3 dos pacientes com espasmo hemifacial apresentaram truque sensorial. Truques sao mais comuns na distonia cervical (81%) quando comparada ao grupo espasmo hemifacial (38,5%) e aogrupo caibra do escrivao (20%).

Define-se o delirio, e segundo Carlos Centeno, como estado confusional agudo que deriva de uma disfuncao cerebral orgânica de etiologia multifactorial. Dependendo dos autores, varia de 28% a 85%. O delirio e um dos sintomas mais dificeis de diagnosticar e tratar, e tambem aquele que provoca maior deterioracao da qualidade de vida do doente e da sua relacao com a familia, cuidadores ou equipa de apoio. A sua presenca condiciona maiores dificuldades na avaliacao da dor, de outros sintomas ou problemas, - a obstipacao, a retencao urinaria, febre, a infeccao respiratoria ou urinaria, desidratacao, etc., - pela perturbacao que causa na comunicacao com o doente e por impedir uma participacao nas decisoes que dizem respeito a sua doenca. Apesar de ser uma situacao esperada no final de vida, pode no entanto, ser reversivel ou controlavel em cerca de 25-45% dos casos, pelo que na sua abordagem deve-se ter em conta esta caracteristica, individualizando-se caso a caso, transmitindo a familia a esperanca da reversibilidade. \nNa doenca avancada, o delirio manifesta-se por: perturbacoes cognitivas, disturbios do comportamento psicomotor, com uma instalacao aguda ou subaguda, com flutuacoes durante o dia, agravando-se para a noite, podendo adoptar uma forma hiperactiva (a mais frequente) e uma forma hipoactiva. O delirio, normalmente de etiologia multifactorial, condiciona um conjunto de medidas de intervencao que passam por: terapeutica dirigida a causa, intervencao no comportamento do doente e no ambiente, apoio a familia e o tratamento sintomatico, sobretudo fazendo uso correcto dos varios tipos de neurolepticos, assim como outro tipo de intervencoes farmacologicas.",

Quite commonly we draw conclusions about an entire population of persons with a specific disorder, or we consider a finding as the correlate of the disorder itself. Several considerations prove this type of generalization wrong, and may lead to false conclusions: for example epidemiological data obtained from rates of medical utilization, the comparison of ill persons and patients suffering from functional gastrointestinal disorders, or a survey of literature about the significance of illness behavior and psychological factors in the demand for medical care. The consequences effect not only the interpretation of empirical results, and the selection of sample survey, but also send a call for fieldstudies on the relevant disorders.",

Numerosas alteraciones metabolicas pueden ser responsables de los trastornos de la conciencia en el postoperatorio, aunque la mayoria no surgen de forma espontanea en el intraoperatorio(2,3). Por ello, una exploracion neurologica superficial es obligada en todo paciente que ingresa y egresa de sala de quirofano, y una determinacion de parametros bioquimicos puede ser necesaria (examenes de laboratorio), asi como la revision detallada de los antecedentes personales y de los acontecimientos intraoperatorios, siempre que no exista un suceso que justifique el problema. La disfuncion cognitiva postoperatoria es un sindrome especifico conocido, con una incidencia que oscila en forma muy variada; segun las diferentes estadisticas, se encuentra entre 0% hasta 79% dependiendo de multiples variables como son el tipo de cirugia, periodo estudiado, poblacion y tipo de test psicologico que se haya implementado. Dado que el deficit cognitivo puede acompanarse de aumento de la morbilidad, sus repercusiones sobre la estadia en el hospital y el costo por paciente pueden ser importantes(4-6). El MMS fue desarrollado por Folstein, et al. (1975) como un metodo practico para facilitar al clinico el graduar el estado cognoscitivo del paciente y poder detectar demencia o delirium. El MMS evalua la orientacion espacial y temporal, el recuerdo inmediato (fijacion), la memoria a medio termino y habilidades de sustraccion serial o el deletreo hacia atras. Tambien mide capacidades constructivas (la habilidad de copiar una figura de Bender), y el uso del lenguaje. La puntuacion total se obtiene sumando los puntos alcanzados en cada tarea y puede ir de 0 a 30(7-9). Una puntuacion entre 27 y 30 puntos se considera normal, de 25 o 26 indica sospecha patologica, de 12 a 24 se considera como deterioro, mientras que una puntuacion de 9 a 12 indica demencia.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

      "title": "Auditory Hallucinations as a Rare Presentation of Occipital Infarcts",
      "abstract": "A stroke is a clinical syndrome characterized by a focal neurologic deficit that can be attributed to a vascular territory within the brain. The presenting features of an acute stroke depends on the area of the brain affected. Although unusual, the presenting feature may include psychosis with auditory and/or visual hallucinations. A 56-year-old female was admitted to the psychiatric unit after threatening her husband with a knife. She reported experiencing altered sensorium for one week with suicidal and homicidal command hallucinations. Given the acute onset, brain images were obtained to rule out an organic etiology. A brain MRI revealed an acute right occipital lobe infarct with hemorrhagic transformation. The patient’s symptoms were self-limited, resolving without antipsychotic medications. Psychosis with auditory hallucinations is not commonly reported following stroke. Since histologic and functional alterations in the occipital lobe appear to play a significant role in psychosis of schizophrenics, it is likely that ischemia in the same area may cause similar changes. Familiarity with this rare presentation is important, as it prevents a delay in diagnosis, which may negatively impact the outcome.",

      "title": "Depressão e comorbilidade: Um caso clínico",
      "abstract": "Introduction: The co-existence of depression and chronic disease is frequent. This association leads to a worse evolution, of both the psychiatric framework and the chronic disease. However, the depression diagnosis is not always evident and even when it is identified correctly it is often under-treated, either for reasons imputable to the doctor or due to the patient's poor adhesion to the therapeutics. Description of the case: Maria frequently attends medical appointments complaining of dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue and bone and joint pains. The identified health problems include entities with a potential aetiological role in these symptoms, which are overvalued by the patient. However, the latter complied only irregularly with the pharmaceutical therapeutics and kept lifestyle detrimental to the control of such health problems. After multiple appointments of similar pattern she admitted, upon questioning, irritability, anhedonia, tendency for social isolation, hypersomnia and depressive humour, which she attributed to her physical aflictions. After several attempts to introduce anti-depressive medication, which the patient waived a few days later, alleging side effects, medical appointments at fortnight intervals resulted in a better compliance with the therapeutics, both anti-depressive and other, less complaints and better control of her chronic diseases. Comment: The emphasis on the somatic symptoms and the fact that they could be explained within the context of the patient's co-morbidity, therefore withdrawn as criteria of depression suspicion, led to the masking of the latter over time. The doctor must always consider the frequency of depression associated with chronic diseases, in order to achieve better diagnosis acuity. The inclusive approach, accounting for symptoms that are irrespective of being explained by the coexisting pathology, lessens the risk of not diagnosing an oligosymptomatic depressive framework, notwithstanding the fact that it may generate false-positive features. On the contrary, the excluding approach used for some time retarded the (false-negative) diagnosis and the treatment, with repercussions on the control of the whole health problems and on the patient's quality of life.",

Ziel dieser Übersicht ist es, anhand einer systematischen Literaturrecherche eine Reihe von Hypothesen zu diskutieren, die dieses überzufällig häufige, gemeinsame Auftreten erklären sollen. Eine Anzahl von Untersuchungen weist auf biologische Gemeinsamkeiten zwischen Depression und Demenz hin, ohne dass diese in allen Studien untermauert werden können. Die Vorgeschichte einer Depression kann als distaler Risikofaktor für demenzielle Erkrankungen angesehen werden. Besonders nach Ausbruch demenzieller Erkrankungen sind depressive Störungen häufig und der Zusammenhang zwischen beiden wahrscheinlich am stärksten. Bei Patienten mit großer kognitiver Reserve kann eine Depression als Reaktion auf die Wahrnehmung der beginnenden kognitiven Defizite gedeutet werden. Sicherlich können Depressionen bei der Alzheimer-Demenz und anderen Demenzformen als eigene Krankheitsentität angesehen werden, zumal sich die klinischen Syndrome von denen anderer Depressionen in früheren Lebensabschnitten etwas unterscheiden. Studien über die Therapie von Depressionen bei Demenzen haben in den letzten Jahren ein steigendes Interesse gefunden. Dabei müssen jedoch bei der Behandlung älterer Patienten mit Antidepressiva einige Regeln beachtet werden, besonders kardiologische und vegetative Nebenwirkungen.",

The pathogenesis is multifactorial but is probably often due to changes in the autonomic nervous system, as well as to age-related changes in the cardiovascular and endocrine systems. In addition, the presence of multiple diseases and medications are common contributing factors. Standardized measurement of postural blood pressure and recording of heart rate and assessment of associated symptoms are essential for the clinical diagnosis. Evaluation and management depend on an initial thorough clinical review of problems. Usually elimination of offending medications and treatment of contributing medical disorders are adequate. Occasionally, use of volume expanders and newer experimental agents is indicated. Postural hypotension can be seen as a prototypical clinical disorder of the elderly. It reflects impaired homeostasis; its etiology is multifactorial and due to the effects of both age and disease; it is clinically protean; and it can result in falls, injury, and progressive decline if not recognized and treated early.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews recent literature which suggests that sleep disturbance in members of the general population, whether or not they have ever had a formal psychiatric disorder, is a risk factor for the onset of a formal psychiatric diagnosis at a later time. Based upon the current literature, the strongest link is between subjective insomnia, lasting at least 2 weeks, and the later onset of depression. Less well-established data suggest that lifetime reports of at least 2 weeks of insomnia, hypersomnia, or both hypersomnia and insomnia, are risk factors for the later development of depression, anxiety disorders or substance abuse. More tentatively, preliminary data suggest that increasing subjective sleep disturbance may signal a relapse in remitted depressed patients. Sleep disturbances are common manifestations of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Therefore, sleep complaints may be among the most robust prodromal symptoms reflecting partial depressive or anxiety disorders, which eventually declare themselves as full-blown clinical episodes.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders refer to a spectrum of conditions that interfere with regular sleep patterns. One of the most frequently reported clinical issues is sleep disturbance. Physiological, neurological, social, and mental well-being can be critically affected by insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Overall, health and quality of life can be impacted by sleep disorders. Mental health and sleep share a significant relationship. It has long been acknowledged that individuals with mental health disorders frequently experience sleep issues. The predominant theory has been that sleep issues are basically signs of the psychiatric disorders that they are interrelated with. The fact that sleep issues are defining characteristics of a number of psychiatric disorders and are included in the diagnostic criteria for these conditions supports this aspect. However, sleep and mental health problems are associated further in diverse ways. Emerging research evidence suggests that the relationship between mental health problems and sleep disorders is complex and includes bi-directional causation, in contrast to the long-held view of this relationship that considered sleep issues as symptoms of psychiatric disorders. An increased prevalence of mental/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among certain others, is reported among patients with insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and narcolepsy, suggesting sleep disorders as a risk factor for mental health disorders. Although much has been established about the relationship between impaired mental health and sleep, further research is required to elaborately comprehend this relationship. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the relationship between sleep disorders and mental health.",

      "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) are often caused by a blow to the head or a sudden jolt resulting in a wide range of physical, cognitive, and emotional temporary symptoms. Mild TBI diagnosis can be challenging and most commonly followed by post-concussion syndrome (PCS). When the symptoms are present for more than 3 months, prolonged post-concussive syndrome (PPCS) can be suspected. This review aims to identify and summarize the current status of the knowledge regarding the risk factors and predictors of the recovery from PCS and PPCS. A comprehensive search of the main scientific databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library) was performed using keywords, such as: 'prolonged post-concussion syndrome', combined with 'risk factors', 'predictors', and 'outcomes'. Multiple studies reported more than one risk factor for PPCS development following mTBIs that were generally the results of sports-related concussions and car accidents. The most prevalent risk factor associated with PPCS was the female sex. Social factors/personality traits, anxiety, mental health disorders, or other health conditions from their past medical history, the occurrence of headache/migraines during TBI recovery, somatization, physical activity, and litigation were also reported to contribute to PPCS risk. An exhaustive approach is required to mitigate the risk of PPCS and to ensure optimal recovery after concussive events. However, larger prospective cohort studies evaluating patients that were examined and treated with standardized protocols could be needed to further validate these associations and mandate the highest risk factors for delayed recovery.",

      "abstract": "Summary Fatigue is an ubiquitous phenomenon that has many definitions, and it is always multidimensional comprising physiological and psychological aspects. It ranges from a chronic symptom in somatic and psychiatric disorders to time-related physiological alterations of primary cortical areas, and to efferent and afferent pathways of the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS) in healthy exercise physiology. Thus, it is necessary to define the context when referring to fatigue. Fatigue can generally be defined as a difficulty in initiating or sustaining a voluntary activity, the latter also being named fatigability in a more strict sense of nomenclature. Fatigue in a clinical setting is best quantified by means of self-reported questionnaires, for example the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The discrimination of accounts of depression, sleepiness, weakness, exercise intolerance and exhaustion relies however on a focused interview, clinical signs, and on the use of additional para-clinical investigations. Time-related physiological alterations during fatiguing tasks can occur at spinal and supraspinal sites, termed central fatigue, as well as at the neuro-muscular junction and in muscle fibres, termed peripheral fatigue. In exercise physiology, both central and peripheral fatigu ec an be assessed by electrophysiological techniques (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, electromyography), pharmacological intervention, functional magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory tests. In the myriad of neurological disorders that cause fatigue, ranging from chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple sclerosis to neuro-muscular disorders and myopathy, different sites of pathological alterations are involved, all yielding to a patient complaining about excessive fatigue. This links the different aspects of fatigue, thus always calling for a multidimensional assessment of this intriguing phenomenon.",

These illnesses include acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorders, and more. The authors maintain that there is another type of injury that has heretofore escaped detection because its symptoms are subtler than those exhibited in the more profound psychopathologies. This injury appears to be related to both depression and moral injury. The authors call this phenomenon \"significance injury.\" This presentation serves as a \"note from the field,\" an attempt to outline nuances in clinical presentation, diagnostics, and possible treatment apropos of significance injury phenomena.",

Evidence suggests that sleep disturbances are one of the risk factors that predict an increased risk for suicidal behaviors. Both sleep disorders and general sleep complaints are linked to higher levels of suicidal ideation and depression, as well as increased rates of suicide and suicide attempts. The causal mechanism of this association is not clear. For example, it is not known if insomnia is an independent phenomenon that if interrupted could prevent the emergence of a mental disorder, or if insomnia is a symptom of another developing illness. Hypofrontality, HPA dysfunction, and an impaired serotonergic system are potential mechanisms underlying the association of sleep disturbances and suicidal behavior. Future research is necessary to examine the specific mechanism of this association between sleep and suicide, which may lead to an effective intervention and diminished suicide risk.",

Anatomic lesions in the temporal-parietal region seem to produce formed hallucinations more frequently than lesions elsewhere (5), yet in most cases ofhallucinations no anatomic site can be found.

      "title": "Developmental coordination disorder continues to evolve",
      "abstract": "Motor coordination has classically been understood in terms of harnessing degrees of freedom and performance variables in the neuro-musculo-skeletal system. In clinical examination, however, coordination is often seen as resulting from a selective contribution to sensorimotor processing by proprioceptive, vestibular input and cerebellar modulation. Therefore, impaired coordination (often described as ataxia) typically rules out other causes such as muscle weakness, abnormal muscle tone, disrupted motor planning, or the occurrence of involuntary movements. This is both a great strength and a difficulty in clinical neurology: many descriptors are based on phenomenological observation, but also have a localizing connotation. For example, dystonia is not any one type of muscle tone impairment, as implied by etymology, but reflects basal ganglia dysfunction. It is distinct from spasticity, which indicates abnormal corticospinal tract function.1 Similarly, aphasia (literally absence of speech) does not overlap with anarthria (absence of articulated speech) but refers to language difficulties that can be traced to other brain regions. Yet, the clinico-anatomical approach is less accurate or is inappropriate when clinical signs relate to brain development.2 In this context, replacing the privative prefix ‘a’ by ‘dys’ sometimes serves to denote the developmental character and signal differences in presentation, clinico-anatomical correlation, outcome, and management needs, as in (developmental) ‘dysphasia’ versus (acquired) ‘aphasia’, or ‘dyspraxia’ versus ‘apraxia’. Growing interest in neurodevelopmental conditions has led many clinicians and researchers to move beyond these semantic considerations. They have adopted a more pragmatic approach to define more useful frameworks for understanding the complexity at stake and assessing intervention approaches. The developmental coordination disorder (DCD) construct has thus emerged to describe a comprehensive developmental condition in which impairments in a child's capacity to develop and execute coordinated motor skills cannot be explained by cognitive or sensory dysfunction or other neurological conditions. In DCD, the hallmark ‘coordination disorder’ is inclusive and not specifically clinico-anatomically localizing. The construct has superseded the restrictive characterization of dyspraxia. Therefore, dyspraxia could potentially be used to address an overlooked aspect of the complex motor phenotype in other defined neurodevelopmental disorders, whether generic (e.g. autism spectrum disorder or cerebral palsy) or specific (e.g. neurogenetic syndromes), which has not been common practice. In many clinical situations, DCD has also proved more relevant than previous concepts based on supposed minimal brain lesions or dysfunction. In 2012, Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology (DMCN) published the outcome of a several-year-long effort by the European Academy of Childhood Disability (EACD) to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, assessment, and management of DCD. These recommendations were based on sound appraisal of the body of studies available then and endeavoured to translate results into good clinical practice. The recommendations have been very influential in clinical practice worldwide. They have also further shaped and clarified the DCD concept for the provision of service and for clinical research. A wealth of new studies published since then have brought valuable insights into motor performance, executive functions, cognition, visual functioning, mental health, other aspects of ‘comorbidity’, quality of life, assessment, as well as clues to pathophysiology and the potential for improving outcomes.3, 4 The way we approach DCD has also changed. To cite but one example relating to nosology, the fifth and latest revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) now lists DCD as a main disorder under a new ‘Neurodevelopmental Disorders’ cluster. In this issue of DMCN, we present the fully updated EACD recommendations,5 which marks an important, historic step in the understanding and treatment of DCD. We expect these recommendations to improve identification, evaluation, and management of this condition. Hopefully, they will continue to enhance the current practical relevance of the DCD construct and contribute to our evolving understanding of DCD in the wider context of developmental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Chronic musculoskeletal pain is defined as chronic pain arising from musculoskeletal structures such as bones or joints. Although comprising the most prevalent set of chronic pain conditions, it was not represented appropriately in the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which was organized mainly according to anatomical sites, was strongly focused on musculoskeletal disease or local damage, and did not consider the underlying mechanisms of pain. The new ICD-11 classification introduces the concept of chronic primary and secondary musculoskeletal pain, and integrates the biomedical axis with the psychological and social axes that comprise the complex experience of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Chronic primary musculoskeletal pain is a condition in its own right, not better accounted for by a specific classified disease. Chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain is a symptom that arises from an underlying disease classified elsewhere. Such secondary musculoskeletal pain originates in persistent nociception in musculoskeletal structures from local or systemic etiologies, or it may be related to deep somatic lesions. It can be caused by inflammation, by structural changes, or by biomechanical consequences of diseases of the nervous system. It is intended that this new classification will facilitate access to patient-centered multimodal pain management and promote research through more accurate epidemiological analyses.",

Moreover, there is a growing evidence that patients with CFS belong to an inhomogeneous group with different etiologic constellations. Specific somatic factors, e.g. viruses, seem to be less important for onset than certain personality-traits like depressiveness and workaholism. These traits lead to an increased vulnerability to unspecific psychological or biological stressors that may cause chronic fatigue by complex psychosomatic interferences. Concerning diagnosis, there are no specific methods or results available, the same is true for pharmacological treatment. As a consequence, practitioners should be aware not to miss a somatic disease causing fatigue, and, parallel to this, start right from the beginning talking about the psychosomatic background of CFS. Furthermore, psychotherapy has shown to be effective in CFS.",

      "abstract": "The presence of physical symptoms that do not correlate with a disease process are often frustrating to healthcare professionals, are difficult to diagnose and may consume an inordinate proportion of healthcare resources. However, proper and complete physical and psychological assessment and treatment is becoming increasingly possible and essential. Physical illness may occur concomitantly and sometimes as a result of psychological distress, which has displayed itself in a diagnosed mental illness. In other cases physical symptoms may be caused by unconscious dynamics, and the process becomes the primary presenting mental concern. In other cases the physical illness is part of a conscious process and motivated by the hope of gain. Differentiation between physical symptoms of unconscious and conscious origin is important in selecting the correct response. A manager must first of all be alert for physical symptoms that appear to be consciously motivated, as in a disorder called \"malingering.\" The essential feature of malingering is the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as avoiding work or obtaining financial compensation. Managers may inadvertently encourage malingering in the workplace by inappropriate responses to employees who present a physical complaint that is consciously motivated for gain. When the manager can recognize this phenomenon as malingering, appropriate managerial intervention can cause this behavior to be controlled and even eliminated and thus enhance productivity.",

Smith 1 in a letter, written in 1780, to William Hunter, referring to ossification of the meninges, which he had discovered, postmortem, in a recent case.In that period of medical practice, such a pathologic finding sufficed to explain the most grotesque and most divergent clinical findings.Paralyses, chorea, epilepsy, a wide range of psychotic manifestations and feeble-minded- ness, constitute a few of the maladies to which Dr. Smith referred.Many case reports were published in an attempt to interpret countless symptoms, the true nature of which the medical man of that period could not otherwise explain, because of what we now know to have been insufficient knowledge of anatomic and physiologic relationship.Again, the accidental discovery of bony tumors, plaques and exten¬ sive ossification of the meninges in persons who had certainly died of systemic disease, and who had not previously manifested cerebral",

      "abstract": "Chronic muscular pain is often regarded as incomprehensible or indefinable when the doctor ``can't find anything'' on examination. However, the physiotherapist often detects physical signs in these patients: changes in posture, holding breath, tense and hard musculature, and poor balance. The findings are dependent on what is being sought. The view of the body as ambiguous, as something a person has and is, can shed light on the way life has left its traces in the body, such as changes in posture and poor balance. In this article it will be argued that combining a physiotherapeutic, a phenomenological, and a biological perspective can make chronic muscular pain more comprehensible. Chronic muscular pain can be perceived not as a sign representing a symbol of underlying factors but rather as a sign understood as an expression of the bodily state.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Traditionally medicine had its share of patients with mental derangement or behavioral disorder, and medical texts included the careful description of these symptoms and their treatment. While in some patients these disturbances preceded the onset of other recognizable physical symptoms, were concomitant with them or subsided with recovery, in still others the mental symptoms or disordered behavior remained. In yet another group of patients mental symptoms or disordered behavior was all that a physician could discern. The situation was further complicated by the fact that there was much overlap among these groups of patients, and that relatively few patients with mental symptoms only came to the attention of physicians. After all a physician was called only when there was grave concern for a sick person and when the physician’s services could be afforded. When the physician was consulted no radically different measures of treatment were prescribed, since medical theory provided guidelines for the treatment of all diseases. In the majority of cases, mental, emotional, or behavioral changes were concomitants of many diseases, and there was no need for a special literature to address these secondary changes, or complications. People who developed mental or behavioral changes without other discernible signs of illness were not necessarily candidates for medical attention; even today we are still uncertain whether all instances of disturbed behavior represent an illness. In such cases, as in all others, the economics of the patient’s situation played an important role, and physicians were ready to interpret a variety of complaints as medical problems when the patient could afford their services.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many patients demonstrate amplified somatic symptom experiences that are felt by providers to cause excessive distress and functional impairment, and that can be diagnostically misleading. Terms attached to these presentations include somatization , medically unexplained symptoms , and, most recently, somatic symptom disorder . The analogous amplification of psychological symptoms has not been considered. Accordingly, this column makes a case for discussion and investigation of psychological symptom amplification (PSA), a process made possible by the medical legitimization of certain types of human suffering. As various forms of psychological suffering gain greater medical legitimacy, PSA becomes increasingly relevant. Circumstantial evidence suggests that unrecognized PSA may distort research findings and clinical efficacy in psychiatry. The largely symptom-based nature of psychiatric diagnosis makes PSA a challenging, but necessary, object of further scientific and clinical scrutiny.",

      "title": "[Current psychological findings in essential hypertension].",
      "abstract": "Many authors have investigated the role of psychic factors in the pathogenesis of idiopathic hypertension. Experimental studies have confirmed that the emotional stress induces a longterm blood pressure increase. Psychophysiologic investigations have revealed that patients with essential hypertension, when compared to the healthy population, are characterized by prompt reactions at the very initial stage of the disease, accompanied by an elevation of the biochemical and vegetative functional parameters, blood pressure in particular. It is in concordance with findings that hypertonics have hemodynamic reactions at rest quite similar to those found in normotonics under the emotional stress. Certain psychosocial factors cannot be identified as absolute causes of the disease. Their particular role varies from person to person. It depends on particular personality features whether any of these factors will be experienced as a stress. It has therefore been assumed that hypertension is a concomitant vegetative phenomenon, typical for people who have a permanent feeling of anger or for ambitious people who are under a permanent pressure of striving for success. Numerous psychological investigations have led to a conclusion that hypertonics have psychological troubles which cannot generally be considered as specific for hypertension. The question concerning the part played by such behaviour as the primary cause of the disease is still to be answered. Doubtlessly, such behaviour is frequent in hypertonics and it probably contributes to persistence of the disease, since they are more apt to stressogenic situations. These findings have resulted in formulating the therapeutic strategies with psychophysiologic orientation. At the physiological level, they resolve the increased excitement and lower the excessive reactivity of the vegetative nervous system, whereas on the psychological level, applying psychotherapy methods, they achieve both cognitive and behavioural changes.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

      "title": "Post traumatic stress disorder in postpartum: when guilt delays recovery. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction PTSD is a mental disorder that may develop after exposure to threatening or horrifying events. PTSD is characterized by the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Some reviewes found that PTSD is prevalent during pregnancy and after birth and may increase during postpartum if not identified and treated. It can affect women, their relationship and birth outcomes aswell as infant emotion regulation and development. The findings indicate that there are links between psychological, traumatic and birth-related risk factors as well as the perceived social support and the possible PTSD following childbirth in mothers and partners. Objectives A case report is presented alongside a review of the relevant literature regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD. Methods We present a case report of a 34-year-old woman with no previous contact with Mental Health Services. She got pregnant unexpectedly in the context of a long stable relationship. At the beginning she was feeling uncertain about carrying on with the pregnancy but finally decided to keep it. She states she felt well throughout the pregnancy. The night after giving birth her baby suffered from a cardiorespiratory arrest, which was noticed by the nursing team but not by the mother. The baby recovered with no medical sequelae but the patient started feeling depressed and presenting anergy, apathy, irritability, flashbacks, and intrusive memories of her sick baby and insomnia, checking every hour during the night that her child was still breathing. Later she developed separation anxiety from her baby, not being able to leave her in the kindergartner nor to leave her alone with other family members (including the father). Guilty feelings were persistantly observed during the therapy sessions. Results Psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment was started with moderate improvement. Since breastfeeding was a rewarding experience and enforced the mother-daughter bond it was taken in consideration for the therapeutic plan. Conclusions The postpartum period is of special vulnerability and early treatment of symptoms in mothers is of great importance. Early diagnosis in maternity services should be a priority.

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Mit dem Begriff Fatigue werden Zustände ungewöhnlicher Müdigkeit und Erschöpfung beschrieben, die in Zusammenhang mit verschiedenen körperlichen Erkrankungen, insbesondere bei Krebs, multipler Sklerose, Parkinson und rheumatoider Arthritis, auftreten können. Im Gegensatz zu Erschöpfungszuständen bei Gesunden ist diese Form der Fatigue dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass sie über längere Zeiträume andauern kann, in keinem angemessenen Verhältnis zu vorangehenden Aktivitäten steht und sich durch Erholungsphasen nicht zurückbildet. Diese Form der Müdigkeit wird als ein multidimensionales Problem beschrieben, das physische, emotionale und kognitive Aspekte umfasst und mit einem hohen subjektiven Leidensdruck verbunden ist. Je nach Ausprägung und Verlauf der Symptomatik führt Fatigue zu einer starken Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität und schränkt die Teilhabe und Alltagsbewältigung ein. Ebenso kommt es häufig zu Einschränkungen der Arbeits- und Erwerbsfähigkeit. Wenngleich die Ursachen der Fatigue immer noch nicht vollständig geklärt sind, ist die Fatigue in Zusammenhang mit körperlichen Erkrankungen vor dem Hintergrund eines multifaktoriellen biopsychosozialen Modells zu verstehen. Die Möglichkeiten der Diagnostik und eine Übersicht über verschiedene Verfahren zur Abklärung der Fatigue werden dargestellt. Ebenso werden die Herausforderungen für die medizinische Versorgung skizziert und Hinweise für den Umgang im klinischen Alltag gegeben.",

These impairments can have a functional origin, but more commonly they result from neurological injury or disease. Functional amnesia is a psychiatric disorder. The amnesia in this case is presumed to result from conflict and repression, and its presentation varies from individual to individual. Typically, a patient is admitted to the hospital in a confused or frightened state. Memory for the past has been lost, especially personal, autobiographical memory. Often, the patient cannot produce his or her own name. Yet, the ability to learn new material is almost always intact. After the disorder clears, usually within a week, the lost memories return except for the events of the day or two just prior to hospital admission. Rarely, the disorder lasts longer, and sizable pieces of the past remain unavailable.",

      "title": "Dissociation and Neurobiological Consequences of Traumatic Stress",
      "abstract": "Abstract According to recent evidence traumatic stress is an important etiological factor in pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases. Typical psychological manifestation of the traumatic stress represents dissociative states. Dissociated states present pathological conditions where psychological trauma may emerge in a variety of forms such as psychic dissociative symptoms or on the other hand as somatoform symptoms including seizures. At this time there is evidence that temporal lobe seizure activity may produce dissociative syndrome and this activity likely may exist independently of neurological focal lesion. This conceptualization of dissociative phenomena is in accordance with findings that originate from the study of the relationship between epilepsy and mental illness and known as antagonism between epilepsy and psychosis or the so-called forced normalization. From this point of view the relationship between dissociation, epileptic activity and kindling phenomena represent useful concepts for understanding of neurobiological consequences of the traumatic stress and dissociation with respect to pathogenesis of stress-related mental diseases.",

The\r\n traumatic event for every man is sudden, unexpected, embarrassing, and in such events the\r\n person is never ready. Every hour, someone becomes a victim of violence, a victim of a\r\n psychological trauma, either directly or as a witness. Consequences such as sexual and / or\r\n psychological abuse, participation in war operations, murders, heavy traffic accidents, natural\r\n disasters, sudden deaths of close relatives can be expressed immediately or developed into\r\n posttraumatic stress disorder. If he is a victim, he certainly wants to know what exactly happened\r\n to be able to take healing, recovery and return to normal life circumstances.\r\n Traumatic experience leaves a lasting mental, emotional, behavioral and physical\r\n consequence that the traumatized person wears on a daily basis. The quality of life and health is\r\n impaired. The person is no longer the same as before or before the trauma. It best recognizes and\r\n finds his family suffering the most. Psycho-radiotherapy is distanced and alienated from its\r\n family, can not function normally in a working and family environment, and what is\r\n characteristic not only of a person suffering from illness but also of members of his family is a\r\n feeling of helplessness that occurs. Family members do not know how and how to help. There is\r\n a need to react in time and seek professional help. Successful treatment is very important for\r\n good communication that needs to be established with the patient and that his family is involved\r\n with the patient as well, because it should be the greatest support and support, and this can\r\n greatly affect the course and outcome of the treatment. The first contact of the patient and his\r\n family with the doctor is through a medical interview, and by the arrival of the patient in the\r\n institution and the search for professional help, the health care service begins to be provided on\r\n an individual level for each patient in a holistic approach involving the entire health care team\r\n employees.\r\n Social awareness of human rights, violence and disasters has increased over the last 20 years,\r\n which has contributed to wars and natural disasters, which has led to the development of\r\n psychotraumatology. In Croatia, the area of psychotraumatology began to develop more\r\n intensively at the beginning of the 90s of the last century or during the Homeland War.",

      "abstract": "Mental health calls make up a large proportion of ambulance workloads, with paramedics responding to a wide range of presentations such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and excited delirium syndrome. Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

      "abstract": "Most sports related injuries are musculoskeletal, affecting limbs or trunk, and related to specific risks associated with particular sports. Head injuries by contrast can occur in many sports and, except those incurred during boxing, are accidental. Unlike other injuries, the effects of which are usually maximal at onset, injury to the head may precipitate a process of intracranial disorder that can convert a mild initial injury into a life threatening condition from secondary complications. Moreover, even mild injuries are often associated with considerable temporary disability, and repeated mild injuries can result in cumulative brian damage. Doctors on sports fields have to decide whether patients with head injury can resume play or, if not, what further immediate management is needed and when they can play again. The answers to these questions depend on a sensible balancing of risks.\n\nIt is damage to the brain that matters when the head is hit. Injuries to the scalp or skull are important only as indicators of the possibility of underlying impact damage or of the risk of complications that could cause secondary brain damage. Either impact or secondary brain damage may be diffuse or focal, and this will influence the clinical features.\n\n(1) Cerebral contusions - Bruising on the brain surface due to the brain's impact with the overlying skull - are the commonest form of impact damage. Contusion may be focal underneath a fracture resulting from a focal impact, blunt or penetrating, or it may be diffuse, resulting from the brain as a whole being thrown against the rough interior surface of the skull and dural dividers. Diffuse contusion results when the head as a whole decelerates, usually by hitting the ground, in which case the contusions are usually bilateral, affecting the tips of both frontal and temporal poles regardless of where the …",

Clinical correlates of post-stroke depression include severity of physical and cognitive impairment as well as location of brain injury. Perhaps the most compelling reason to identify post-stroke depression, however, is its substantial impact on recovery in activities of daily living, cognitive function, and survival. Antidepressant medication has been shown to effectively treat depression, although its administration may require careful clinical monitoring. Other post-stroke emotional/behavioral disorders include mania, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, apathy, and pathological crying. Controlled studies have not documented the effect of these disorders on long-term recovery, but the potential impact of syndromes such as mania and apathy on rehabilitation efforts or pathological crying on social functioning are evident. With the exception of pathological crying, which has been shown to respond to antidepressant drug therapy, the other post-stroke emotional/behavioral disorders need to be evaluated in controlled treatment trials for response to therapy.",

Her postconcussive symptoms are affecting her school performance and social and family life. Clinical Outcomes Assessment: Concussion is typically evaluated via symptoms, cognition, and balance. There is no specific patient-oriented outcomes measure for concussion. Clinicians can choose from a variety of generic and specific outcomes instruments aimed at assessing general health-related quality of life or various concussion symptoms and comorbidities such as headache, migraine, fatigue, mood disturbances, depression, anxiety, and concussion-related symptoms. Clinical Decision Making: The data obtained from patient self-report instruments may not actively help clinicians make return-to-play decisions; however, these scales may be useful in providing information that may help the athlete return to school, work, and social activities. The instruments may also serve to identify issues that may lead to problems down the road, including depression or anxiety, or serve to further explore the nature of an athlete’s symptoms. Clinical Bottom Line: Concussion results in numerous symptoms that have the potential to linger and has been associated with depression and anxiety. The use of outcomes scales to assess health-related quality of life and the effect of other symptoms that present with a concussion may allow clinicians to better evaluate the effects of concussion on physical, cognitive, emotional, social, school, and family issues, leading to better and more complete management.",

      "title": "Insomnia in peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women and in some somatic diseases",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

Factitious disorder and malingering are the only two disorders in the DSM ‐5 that require the intentional production of symptoms; the two are distinguished on the basis of underlying incentive. Factitious disorder is difficult to study, as patients that clearly have this diagnosis rarely consent to research. Case reports indicate that the disorder is most common in young women in the health‐care profession, although the most chronic and severe form (Munchausen syndrome) occurs primarily in men. Etiology of the disorder is unknown, although many patients with this diagnosis had a serious childhood illness. Treatment can be difficult, as patients with a feigned physical disorder rarely believe they are psychologically disordered.",

In cancer patients, it is defined as ‘distressing persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning’. In the majority of patients receiving palliative care, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial. The most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation. Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue. Initial management should aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes However, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered.",

      "title": "Psychomotor epilepsy in childhood.",
      "abstract": "The most poorly understood and most frequently misdiagnosed seizure state of childhood is psychomotor epilepsy. Difficulties in diagnosis are related to the variety of possible clinical manifestations which characteristically differ from one child to another. In addition, psychomotor epilepsy can occur at any age, even during infancy. Therefore, the child9s ability to verbalize the perceptive and affective sensations of this seizure state is obviously limited by his chronologic age. The diagnostic dilemma is further complicated as physicians tend to confuse psychomotor seizures and petit ma! epilepsy. INCIDENCE AND ETIOLOGY The terms psychomotor and temporal lobe epilepsy are often used synonymously and interchangeably. At times the seizure state may also be called uncinate epilepsy, epileptic automatisms or epileptic fuges. However, not all psychomotor seizures are associated with temporal lobe lesions, nor is temporal lobe pathology always productive of psychomotor epilepsy. Abnormalities and electrical foci from areas other than the temporal lobe can produce this seizure state. For these reasons, the term psychomotor epilepsy is preferred, and temporal lobe epilepsy, if used, should be restricted to those psychomotor seizures that result from primary temporal lobe pathology. Ten to 20% of children in most pediatric seizure clinics have psychomotor epilepsy. Focal lesions are often considered to be the responsible etiologic factor, but diffuse encephalopathies, above all in children, are more commonly encountered. Prolonged febrile convulsions, perinatal trauma and hypoxia, craniocerebral trauma or meningoencephalitis can be the specific etiologic condition. Expansive lesions including neoplasms, vascular malformations, cysts and abscesses must be considered, especially when there is clinical or electrical evidence of a focal lesion.",

Shared psychotic disorder, or folie ? deux, is a rare entity characterized by the transmission of psychotic symptoms from one patient (the inducer) to another (the induced). Delusional disorder is a type of mental illness (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis code F24; it was moved from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, to Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders). Only one person (the inducer) suffers from a real psychotic disorder, and the other/s is/ are induced, and most often recover/s after separation from the inducer. Case Report. Based on the medical records and available literature on this condition, we present a case of a mother and son with this disorder, where the son with a paranoid psychosis transfers it to his mother. They lived alone in the same household for years, socially isolated from the others. Conclusion. In general, the research has shown that there are no uniform opinions among authors regarding the incidence of the disorder in males and females, at younger and older age, as well as in relationships between partners, siblings, and between parents and children. Most agree that longterm social isolation is among the most common risk factors, as well as dominance and strong power of suggestion in one partner, and passivity and tendency to suggestion in the other.",

      "title": "Συγκριτική μελέτη επιθετικότητας - επικινδυνότητας σε ασθενείς με σχιζοφρένεια",
      "abstract": "Η σχιζοφρένεια είναι μια πολύ σοβαρή ψυχική διαταραχή, που εμφανίζεται σε κλινική μορφή με χρόνια ψυχωσικά επεισόδια, παραληρητικές ιδέες, ψευδαισθήσεις, εκσεσημασμένο άγχος, περίεργη συμπεριφορά και αυτοκτονικές τάσεις. Τα αίτιά της είναι άγνωστα, όμως κληρονομικοί παράγοντες και νευροβιολογικές ανισορροπίες στη χημεία του εγκεφάλου, μπορούν να αυξήσουν την ευαλωτότητα ή την προδιάθεση του ατόμου να πυροδοτήσει ψυχωσικά επεισόδια. Οι υπάρχουσες μελέτες πάνω στη σχιζοφρένεια από τα πεδία της ψυχιατρικής ή της ψυχιατροδικαστικής, την προβάλλουν ως ένα σημαντικό παράγοντα κινδύνου για άσκηση βίας ή και τέλεση αξιόποινης πράξης. Η σύνδεσή της με το έγκλημα έχει αποτυπωθεί και σε ελληνική, αλλά κυρίως σε ξένη βιβλιογραφία, υποδεικνύοντας τη μεγάλη της συσχέτιση με άνδρες, άγαμους, που εμφανίζουν πλημμελή συμμόρφωση στη λήψη φαρμακευτικής αγωγής, συννοσηρότητα και μεγάλη διάρκεια της νόσου. Η παρούσα ελληνική μελέτη είχε σκοπό να αναδείξει τα ιδιαίτερα χαρακτηριστικά προσωπικότητας και ψυχικής διαταραχής Ελλήνων ασθενών με σχιζοφρένεια, που εμφανίζουν επιθετική/ βίαιη συμπεριφορά, διαπράττουν βίαια εγκλήματα, όπως η ανθρωποκτονία και η απόπειρα ανθρωποκτονίας. Παράλληλα, έγινε προσπάθεια να αναλυθεί ο τρόπος που διαφοροποιούνται αυτά τα χαρακτηριστικά και η άσκηση βίας σε σχέση με άλλα άτομα με σχιζοφρένεια, που δεν εμφανίζουν βίαιη συμπεριφορά. Η σπουδαιότητα της μελέτης έγκειται στο γεγονός ότι στη χώρα μας έως σήμερα δεν υπάρχουν στοιχεία σχετικά με το ζήτημα αυτό, ενώ στερεοτυπικές και στιγματιστικές αντιλήψεις κυριαρχούν ακόμη απέναντι σε άτομα που αντιμετωπίζουν προβλήματα ψυχικής υγείας και πάσχουν από μείζονες ψυχικές διαταραχές, όπως η σχιζοφρένεια. Υπάρχει η ανάγκη διεξαγωγής μελετών σχετικά με την επιθετικότητα και την επικινδυνότητα των ασθενών με σχιζοφρένεια, καθώς η αποασυλοποίηση και η κοινωνική επανένταξή τους είναι σε εξέλιξη. Μεθοδολογικά, αποτελεί μια συγχρονική μελέτη , σε δείγμα 220 ανδρών, που πληρούσαν τα διαγνωστικά κριτήρια DSM-IV-TR της σχιζοφρένειας. Διεξήχθη από τον Ιανουάριο του 2011 έως το Νοέμβριο του 2015, σε ασθενείς που νοσηλεύονταν ακούσια στο Ψυχιατρικό Νοσοκομείο Αττικής «ΔΑΦΝΙ» ή που νοσηλεύονταν ως ακαταλόγιστοι ή κρατούνταν στο Ψυχιατρικό Τμήμα του Καταστήματος Κράτησης Κορυδαλλού. Η μελέτη συσχέτισε τρεις ομάδες ασθενών: α) Ομάδα Α (Σχιζοφρένεια - χωρίς ιστορικό βίας), 74 ασθενείς με διάγνωση σχιζοφρένειας και συναφών διαταραχών (DSM-IV-TR), που νοσηλεύονταν ακούσια σε τμήματα οξέων περιστατικών του Ψυχιατρικού Νοσοκομείου Αττικής - ΨΝΑ, «ΔΑΦΝΙ», β) Ομάδα Β (Σχιζοφρένεια – με Βία ή Βίαιο έγκλημα) 74 ασθενείς με διάγνωση σχιζοφρένειας και συναφών διαταραχών (DSM-IV-TR), με ιστορικό βίαιης συμπεριφοράς, που νοσηλεύονταν ακούσια σε τμήματα οξέων περιστατικών του Ψυχιατρικού Νοσοκομείου Αττικής - ΨΝΑ, «ΔΑΦΝΙ» (Ν=43) ή κρατούνταν στο Ψυχιατρικό Τμήμα του Καταστήματος Κράτησης Κορυδαλλού - ΨΚΚ (Ν=31) και γ) Ομάδα Γ (Σχιζοφρένεια – Ακαταλόγιστοι – Βίαιο έγκλημα), 72 ασθενείς με διάγνωση σχιζοφρένειας και συναφών διαταραχών (DSM-IV-TR), που νοσηλεύονταν σύμφωνα με το ά.69 του Ποινικού Κώδικα (ακαταλόγιστοι), στο Ψυχιατρικό Νοσοκομείο Αττικής - ΨΝΑ, «ΔΑΦΝΙ». Επίσης, πραγματοποιήθηκαν συγκρίσεις (με μονοπαραγοντικά και πολυπαραγοντικά μοντέλα λογιστικής παλινδρόμησης) α) των ασθενών του ΨΚΚ με ασθενείς του ΨΝΑ, στην Ομάδα Β, β) Ομάδας Γ με ασθενείς του ΨΚΚ, της Ομάδας Β, γ) Ομάδας Γ με ασθενείς του ΨΝΑ,της Ομάδας Β, δ) Ομάδας Γ με Ομάδα Β σε υποσύνολο ασθενών με διατακτικές ψευδαισθήσεις, για τη διαπίστωση των πιθανοτήτων να ανήκουν τα άτομα σε ομάδα μεγαλύτερης βαρύτητας, θεωρώντας ότι η διάταξη από τη χαμηλότερη προς τη μεγαλύτερη βαρύτητα είναι : ΨΝΑ - Β Ομάδας, ΨΚΚ - Β Ομάδας και Ομάδα Γ. Τα δεδομένα των ασθενών ελήφθησαν μέσω συνεντεύξεων και δομημένων/ημι-δομημένων διαγνωστικών διεργασιών και ψυχομετρικών εργαλείων. Η κλινική εκτίμηση και διάγνωση διατυπώθηκε σύμφωνα με το DSM-IV-TR. Τα κύρια συμπεράσματα της μελέτης υποδεικνύουν ότι το δείγμα μας αποτελούνταν ως επί το πλείστον από ασθενείς με παρανοειδούς τύπου σχιζοφρένεια, κυρίως άγαμοι, με πολύ περιορισμένους συναισθηματικούς δεσμούς και χωρίς πρόσφατους συναισθηματικούς δεσμούς. Είχαν χαμηλό έως μέτριο βιοτικό επίπεδο, χαμηλές έως μέτριες ακαδημαϊκές επιδόσεις και περιορισμένη επαγγελματική δραστηριότητα. Οι περισσότεροι ασθενείς εμφάνισαν πλημμελή συμμόρφωση στη φαρμακευτική τους αγωγή. Οι πιο σοβαροί ψυχο-κοινωνικοί, προδιαθεσικοί παράγοντες που αναδείχθηκαν προπαντός για τις «βίαιες» ομάδες, ήταν η κακή σχέση με τους γονείς, το διαζύγιο γονέων σε μικρή ηλικία των ασθενών, η επιρροή των συνομηλίκων υπό την έννοια της ένταξης σε συμμορίες ή σε «κακές παρέες», το ιστορικό νεανικής παραβατικότητας και η μη ύπαρξη υποστηρικτικού περιβάλλοντος. Φάνηκε ότι έκαναν περιστασιακή χρήση ουσιών, κυρίως κάνναβης και αλκοόλ. Τα περισσότερα άτομα παρουσίασαν προηγούμενο ιστορικό βίας πριν από την έναρξη της νόσου και προ ενηλικίωσης, όπως νεανική παραβατικότητα, λεκτική επιθετικότητα, συγκρούσεις με την οικογένειά τους, βανδαλισμούς και συλλήψεις. Τα περισσότερα άτομα (75%) επίσης, δεν παρουσίασαν στη συμπτωματολογία τους ιστορικό διατακτικών ακουστικών ψευδαισθήσεων, αλλά όσα εμφάνισαν, ανήκαν στις «βίαιες» ομάδες. Σαφώς όμως, η Ομάδα Β και η Ομάδα Γ κατέγραψαν τα υψηλότερα ποσοστά βίας. Η σοβαρότητα του ιστορικού βίας ή επιθετικής συμπεριφοράς/ εγκληματικότητας σε σχέση με την έναρξη της νόσου, κυρίως για τις Ομάδες της «βίας», διαφαίνεται από τη λεκτική επιθετικότητα προ της εισαγωγής για νοσηλεία ή κατά τη νοσηλεία, από ετεροκαταστροφικότητα απέναντι σε πρόσωπα και αντικείμενα προ της εισαγωγής για νοσηλεία. Η μελέτη υπογράμμισε τις διαφοροποιήσεις των τριών ομάδων σε σχέση με τη βία, που επιβεβαιώθηκαν από τις θετικές και αρνητικές υποκλίμακες, της κλίμακας PANSS. Από την περαιτέρω σύγκριση των υπο-ομάδων φάνηκε να διατηρούνται τα αποτελέσματα της σύγκρισης Ομάδας Γ έναντι Ομάδας Β, ακόμη και στις υποομάδες ασθενών με σχιζοφρένεια στο ΨΚΚ και ΨΝΑ, της Ομάδας Β. Πιο συγκεκριμένα, το εύρημα αρνητικής συσχέτισης μεταξύ διάρκειας χρήσης κάνναβης και πιθανότητας να ανήκει ο ασθενής στην Ομάδα Γ, φαίνεται να επιβεβαιώνεται καθαρά, όταν η σύγκριση επικεντρώνεται στην υπο-ομάδα της Ομάδας Β, των ασθενών που νοσηλεύονταν στο ΨΝΑ. Για την υπο-ομάδα της Ομάδας Β των ασθενών που νοσηλεύονταν στο ΨΚΚ, η σχέση ήταν λιγότερο ισχυρή και μη στατιστικά σημαντική. Το εύρημα σχετικά με τη θετική σχέση αλκοόλ και Ομάδας Γ επιβεβαιώνεται, όταν η σύγκριση επικεντρώνεται στην υπο-ομάδα της Ομάδας Β, των ασθενών που νοσηλεύονταν στο ΨΝΑ, ενώ για το ΨΚΚ δεν ήταν στατιστικά σημαντικό. Η αρνητική σχέση της νεανικής παραβατικότητας και πιθανότητας να ανήκει ο ασθενής στην Ομάδα Γ, φαίνεται να διατηρείται σχεδόν αναλλοίωτη και στις δύο επιπλέον συγκρίσεις (Ομάδα Γ έναντι Β-ΨΝΑ και Ομάδα Γ έναντι Β-ΨΚΚ). Το ίδιο ισχύει και για τη θετική σχέση μεταξύ των μεγάλων χρονικών διαστημάτων μεταξύ έναρξης νόσου και εκδήλωσης εγκληματικότητας της Ομάδας Γ και για την αρνητική σχέση μεταξύ μέτριας ή κακής υγείας (κατά το ψυχομετρικό εργαλείο SF36) και της πιθανότητας ο ασθενής να ανήκει στην Ομάδα Γ. Οι θετικές σχέσεις με τις υποκλίμακες Θ1 (παραληρητικές ιδέες) και A6 (έλλειψη αυθορμητισμού και ροής στην ομιλία) της κλίμακας PANSS, το σκορ της κλίμακας PCL_SV για την ψυχοπαθητικότητα και τους ψυχοκοινωνικούς προδιαθεσικούς παράγοντες, που υποδεικνύουν την πιθανότητα να ανήκει ο ασθενής στην Ομάδα Γ, φαίνεται να διατηρούνται τουλάχιστον ως προς την κατεύθυνση της σχέσης (δηλαδή οι σχέσεις παραμένουν θετικές) και στις επιπλέον συγκρίσεις των υπο-ομάδων ΨΚΚ και ΨΝΑ, με την Ομάδα Γ, ενώ σε αρκετές περιπτώσεις διατηρούν και τη στατιστική τους σημαντικότητα. Αντίστοιχα, η υποκλίμακα Θ7 (εχθρότητα) της κλίμακας PANSS είχε αρνητική σχέση με τις πιθανότητες να ανήκει ο ασθενής στην Ομάδα Γ. Αυτή η αρνητική σχέση με την υποκλίμακα Θ7 (εχθρότητα), όπως εκτιμήθηκε στη συνολική σύγκριση της ομάδας Γ με την ομάδα Β, παραμένει σχεδόν αναλλοίωτη και στατιστικά σημαντική και στις επιμέρους συγκρίσειςτων υποομάδων ΨΚΚ και ΨΝΑ με την ομάδα Γ. Εν γένει, μπορεί να ειπωθεί ότι η μελέτη της βίας σε άτομα που πάσχουν από σοβαρές ψυχικές διαταραχές, όπως η σχιζοφρένεια, προσφέρει πληθώρα γνώσεων για τη βαθύτερη αντίληψη και κατανόηση των μηχανισμών, που υποβόσκουν στην εκδήλωση μιας βίαιης και επιθετικής συμπεριφοράς, αλλά και γύρω από την ανάπτυξη προληπτικών και θεραπευτικών παρεμβάσεων με σκοπό την καλύτερη εκτίμηση της επικινδυνότητας, τη μείωση βίαιων συμπεριφορών και τη μείωση υποτροπών σε τέτοιους ασθενείς.Λέξεις κλειδιά: σχιζοφρένεια, ανθρωποκτονία, εγκληματικότητα, βία, επιθετικότητα ουσιοεξάρτηση.",

Such patients often actually do become weak, either from mere inaction, or from the malassimilation induced thereby and the worries they permit themselves; this is a familiar picture in a traumatic neurosis,<sup>1</sup>so-called.

In evaluating the capacities of an individual after the occurrence of a head injury the total picture must be examined, for the disturbance is more than the sum of hemiplegia and epilepsy. Even if post-traumatic seizures do develop, it should be clearly understood that they do not forecast recurrent convulsive attacks. The contention that a few dizzy spells or momentary blackouts after a head injury, along with abnormal electroencephalographic findings, are sufficient to establish the diagnosis a chronic epilepsy is false, since neither these clinical manifestations nor abnormal brain waves are adequate for the diagnosis of a convulsive disorder per se.",

After an athlete experiences a traumatic event, sequelae may include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but also other reactions, especially culture-specific patterns of symptoms and comorbidities such as depression. Comorbid substance abuse can hide unrecognized PTSD. Posttraumatic symptoms in athletes interfere with rehabilitation and performance. Support and treatment of posttraumatic symptoms in athletes require specialized care. Ethical dilemmas can develop, especially when traumatic stress is resulting from abuse, from events related to overtraining, or from inadequate care or violence within teams.",

      "abstract": "The majority of people who have experienced traumatic events do not suffer long-lasting psychological sequelae. The development of post-traumatic psychopathology depends on individual vulnerability, both genetic and acquired, the nature and severity of the traumatic event, and the quality of the post-traumatic environment. Children who are the victims of abuse or neglect may be particularly profoundly affected by their experience. Even if the stress is only relatively small, if the trauma occurs at a sensitive or critical period of psychological development, a child's cognitive or emotional functioning may not progress normally. The psychopathology of severe personality disorder may thus originate at an early age. Adults who have previously experienced such traumaticevents and who are then involved in later traumatic incidents may be particularly susceptible subsequently to manifest severe psychological disorder. However, even if there is no pre-existing vulnerability, severe trauma can lead to the development of the full range of abnormal psychological symptoms in someone who was previously healthy.",

      "abstract": "Orthostatic headache is a key symptom of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Other features may include neck pain, interscapular pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tinnitus, and blurred vision. Various psychological or mental symptoms such as depression, forgetfulness, and a decreased power of concentration may also occur in this syndrome. When these symptoms are prominent or precede the onset of other symptoms, the clinical picture of this syndrome becomes more complicated, leading to misdiagnosis or long-term neglect. Of note, patients with cerebrospinal fluid leakage who visit an otolaryngological or oto-neurological clinic usually have atypical manifestations. In the vast majority of our patients with this syndrome, the presenting symptom is dizziness, not headache. The presenting symptom of the 30-year-old female patient who is the subject of this report was also dizziness. The patient's initial symptom was a stomachache; however, medical therapy was ineffective, and endoscopic examination of the stomach revealed no abnormalities. The stomachache was diagnosed as resulting from psychological or mental causes. Other manifestations also indicated that the patient suffered from mental depression. Antidepressants and sleeping pills were prescribed, but no improvement was noted. Dizziness, unsteadiness, nausea, and loss of concentration occurred insidiously and worsened after the patient hit her occiput strongly against a wall during an attack of hyperventilation. The patient also complained of headache. The patient was referred to our clinic by a local otolaryngologist. At the time of the patient's initial visit, a slight unsteadiness was noted while the patient stood and walked, but other vestibular functions were normal. A neurological examination did not show any abnormalities. Psychological testing confirmed the presence of depression. The patient, presumably because of her depression, was dispirited and never discussed her symptoms voluntarily. However, a detailed history revealed that the patient had an orthostatic headache, paresthesia in both hands, blurred vision, and forgetfulness. Several episodes of falls at a pool-side occurring as early as during elementary school were also noted. The diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leakage was confirmed by brain MRI and 111In-cisternography examinations. An epidural blood patch was performed three times. The patient recovered from her depression; although a mild headache and nausea persisted, all the patient's other symptoms, including dizziness and unsteadiness, improved dramatically. The patient returned to work.",

However, the non-specificity of these symptoms, the differences in subjective feelings of patients, the influence of sociocultural factors, and the concealment of patients all pose challenges for the accurate diagnosis of depressive disorders. This paper discusses the clinical characteristics of depressive disorder and the challenges faced in the diagnosis process, and puts forward coping strategies and suggestions, such as detailed medical history inquiry, comprehensive physical examination, the use of standardized rating scales, and the improvement of doctors' cognition and diagnostic ability, so as to improve the diagnostic accuracy of depressive disorder and provide patients with more accurate treatment plans.",

It is true that there are a great number of oligophrenia syndromes with known aetiology, but together they represent a numerically small group.

It is not enough investigated, what kind of disorders they are like, their characteristics are, and how they differ from schizoid personality disorder and continuous sluggish schizophrenia. with the aim to define the clinical features of schizotypal personality disorder 58 patients were examined. Results: • Schizotypal personality disorder is similar to deficit states, observed at schizophrenia, clinically limited to personality sphere, without the signs of flow of endogenous process and psychotic disorders. • Schizotypal personality disorder on the clinical content reminds schizoid, but insignificant ideatory disorders are typical. Dymamic of psychopathy - disposition to decompensation - is never observed. • Schizotypal personality disorder can be diagnosed as latent schizophrenia, because the clinical picture is similar. the special value acquires a dynamic aspect typical of the endogenous process. • High quality remission of schizophrenia limited of specific personality changes, as a variant of «acquired psychopathy» can be considered as clinically identical to «schizotypal personality disorder». Conclusion: A content of Schizotypal personality disorder includes a group of disorders of schizophrenia spectrum, different originally, from shizofreniform personality disorders without the signs of dynamics to the different states of development of schizophrenia - initial (latent schizophrenia), and final (high quality remission of schizophrenia as practical completion of schizophrenia process with the formation of certain features of personality).

      "abstract": "Hallucinations are misperceptions of things or events with one or more senses when an internal or external trigger doesn’t exist. They can be divided into visual, audioverbal, olfactorical, tactile and gustatory. Hallucinations develop due to 3 main pathophysiologicalmechanisms: psychophysiological, psychobiochemical (neurohormone dependent) and psychodynamic. Etiology of these perceptions consists of many things and is not always binned to psychiatric illnesses. These are some of the etiological factors which will be mentioned further bellow: psychosis, delirium, dementia, Charles Bonnet syndrome, Anton syndrome, seizures, migraine, Lhermitte syndrome, sleep disorders and “Alice in Wonderland” syndrome. Audioverbal hallucinations are thought to be a misperceptionof one’s own thoughts which are understood as the speech of someone else. This happens because of distorted function of frontotemporal efferents. These parts of brain are known for their sensorial region activation in the brain and also for the identification and perception of triggers that arise in a person. Furthermore, and increased activity of Wernicke’s region, right putamen, thalamus, and nucleus caudatus was also noticed. During the events of audioverbalhallucinations increased activity of Broca’s region and dorsal cortex of gyrus cinguli were noticed. Subcortical structures might also be the reason or the regulating part of the brain responsiblefor the manifestation of hallucinations which originate in the cortex. Visual hallucinations appear after triggering the primary or associational visual cortex, deafferetion mechanism, when there is some sort of damage to the periferial or central parts of nervous system responsible for visual perceptions. In addition, sleep and wakefulness cycles might be unbalanced and there can be some cognitive disorders.",

This is one area in which expensive investigations are difficult to perform and frequently unhelpful.

Its presentation appears to be relatively independent of cultural factors. A previous history, or a family history, of psychotic illness seems very uncommon. However, substance abuse and/or head injury seem to be background factors in a high proportion of younger patients and I would speculate about the role of the ageing brain in the more elderly patients. Within the delusional system, the patient shows marked illogicality insisting, against all evidence, on a physical aetiology, going to many physicians, and initiating strange 'cures' of his own. Although paranoid anger is not uncommonly a feature, secondary depression, shame and avoidant behaviour are more frequent. The illness causes great anguish, and sometimes suicide. Folie à deux is relatively common. At present, pimozide appears to be the most specific treatment and can be dramatically effective. There are scattered reports of improvement or even cure with other neuroleptics or tricyclic antidepressants but, in general, these seem less effective than pimozide (Cashman & Pollock, 1983; Brotman & Jenike, 1984; Pylko & Sicignan, 1985). However, a single case report recently from the USA is intriguing: an apparently excellent result with amoxapine, currently perhaps the most antidopaminergic of the antidepressant drugs (Tollefson, 1985). However, although the case description is suggestive of MHP, the author regards it as one of major depressive illness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This personality disorder is frequently characterized by cuts and scratches made by the patients using sharp objects to inflict themselves when in situations causing great psychological distress. A case of a young female student is presented who exhibited a clear auto-destructive behaviour. Due to a tragic psychodynamic development, she committed suicide by means of carbamazepine intoxikation. In addition to the impressive morphological and traumatological injury pattern, the psychiatric case history of the female patient also showed that she had suffered from a typical borderline personality disorder.",

      "title": "Genital self‑mutilation: A challenging pathology (Review)",
      "abstract": "Genital self‑mutilation is a pathology that leads to numerous and important discussions, rarely presented in the medical literature. There have been many attempts to explain the reasons behind these medical phenomena, but single cases have been generally reported, making it extremely difficult to draw valid conclusions. It is acknowledged that there are psychotic and non‑psychotic causes, from psychiatric problems and sexual identity disorders to cultural or religious reasons, alcohol or recreational drug consumption, unconventional types of sexual satisfaction or self‑satisfaction. Recent theories consider self‑mutilation as a phenomenon of reducing distress or tension, as an expression of feelings of anger or sorrow. It is believed that 55‑85% of those who have resorted to self‑mutilation have at least once in their life tried to commit suicide. There is evidence that early discovery and intervention as well as proper treatment in regards to psychosis can significantly reduce the number of self‑mutilation episodes, with a protective role of these individuals. Cases of genital self‑mutilation may be considered real medical emergencies, sometimes extremely challenging and accompanied by severe complications. Injury of the genital area is usually accompanied by numerous early or long‑term complications due to the marked vascular area and to the microbial flora present in this part of the body. The degree of mutilation is an unforeseen aspect that the medical staff may have to encounter during the intervention, sometimes testing their imagination and surgical skills when dealing with such a case. Understanding the causes of these self‑aggressive behaviors, which may be life‑threatening, is critical and multidisciplinary mobilization is needed after treatment of the acute phases. The outcome of these patients depends on integrated collaborative work. These cases represent a serious reason for frustration for the physicians involved in solving them, and knowledge of these issues is valuable to urologists, psychiatrists and other health professionals.",

      "abstract": "The location of single strategic infarcts and the cognitive impairment after a stroke reect the neuroanatomy of the brain's cognitive functions. Poststroke dementia or post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSD/PSCI) is a form of cognitive disturbance caused by cerebrovascular disease that can manifest at different times after a stroke, including during the acute phase of stroke, during the recovery phase (while motor stroke symptoms improve), or months and years later. The onset of cognitive impairment depends on the location of infarct. Infarct in certain locations have cognitive impairment as a sole presentation from the outset. Infarcts in the left frontotemporal lobes, right parietal lobe, and left thalamus are notably correlated with cognitive impairment following a stroke. In the former, patients present with complains of motor difculties as the main complain. In addition to these locations, vascular lesions in the thalamo-perforating area of the PCAmay cause dementia and other forms of severe memory loss. Abaseline (pre-morbid) and early post-stroke (early post-morbid) cognitive status should be evaluated and a protocol for the same is needed in regular clinical and ICU care facilities. MoCA assessment is commonly used for cognitive assessment. Its role in strategic infarcts is undermined as it leaves out the evaluation of symptoms corresponding to common strategic infarct locations such as the medial temporal lobe and thalami. There is a need for dedicated neuropsychological assessment score based on education level, and native-language for PSCI.",

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

Although the association between specific clinical symptomatology and lesion location is one of the fundamental goals of clinical practice in neurology, this has rarely been the case with psychiatric disorders. Cognitive functions such as visual spatial reasoning, auditory comprehension, speech production, and extent and severity of motor or sensory impairment are all symptoms of stroke which are commonly used by clinicians to localize lesions to particular brain regions. There is, however, no known neuropathology consistently associated with primary mood disorders (i.e., mood disorders not associated with a physical illness), and, even among secondary mood disorders (i.e., mood disorders associated with a physical illness) the idea that there maybe a focal neuropathology associated with the development of major depression has led to both surprise and skepticism.",

      "abstract": "Depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) is a severely under-studied mental disorder, regardless of being relatively as prevalent as other serious mental illnesses (SMI) to the general population, such as schizophrenia and obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD). Due to the nature of the current body of work on the disorder, it's clear there is a need for further research, as there are only a few small scale studies that approach the contradistinction in symptomatology between varying onset triggers. This paper proposes an investigation into whether there is a distinction in severity, duration, and persistence of symptoms between individuals with DPDR triggered by drugs versus non-drug induced cases. The proposed study hypothesizes that symptoms in drug induced individuals will be significantly different from cases induced by other triggers. The outcome of symptoms may depend on many factors, a few such as whether or not an individual continues to experiment with drugs following the development of DPDR, running the risk of re-exposing themselves to a severe episode, whether or not symptoms rooted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) retrigger dissociative episodes, and the potential of co-occurring hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) causing symptoms of perceptual disturbances. The proposed study will use a survey design to collect data from 175 participants, targeting individuals who are currently experiencing DPDR or DPDR-like symptoms, or have recovered from the disorder. Given that significant evidence of distinction is uncovered, this study may be the stepping stone to addressing and developing treatment options for DPDR sufferers in the future.",

      "abstract": "Negative symptoms have been considered to be specific to schizophrenia or a subtype of schizophrenia: the deficit syndrome. In other words, these symptoms have been considered to be categorically different from other forms of human behavior and experience, whether they occur in healthy persons or patients with other psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we advocate a dimensional approach to negative symptoms, which is supported by two main arguments. First, enduring negative symptoms can even be observed in a variety of psychiatric disorders and they are not specific to schizophrenia. Second, we review evidence that negative symptoms show a continuous distribution from apparently healthy subjects to those with a fully developed clinical syndrome. Although the evidence does not allow for a definite decision concerning the dimensional distribution of negative symptoms, it certainly justifies exploring a dimensional approach with respect to its clinical and scientific utility. Understanding negative symptoms as a variation of normal mental processes will strengthen the development of neurocognitive models and treatment approaches.",

      "abstract": "Health and disease processes are developed due to biological, psychological and social determinants. Obesity is usually associated with mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. This association is evidenced in both directions. Mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders, contribute to the development of obesity, as well as obesity increases the incidence of mental disorders. When stability and homeostasis are disrupted, due to chronic stress and factors such as genetics, environment, affective relationships and psychosocial support, allostatic overload is evidenced. Through this overload, multiple systems are misbalanced and clinical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, occur. The diagnoses of mental disorders are made based on a combination of somatic and psychiatric symptoms. Unexplained physical complaints and generic symptoms like depressed mood, sadness, impatience, irritability and restlessness are the most frequent ones, together with sleep and appetite disturbances, caused both by physical and mental disorders. These factors often make the correct diagnosis in obese patients more difficult. The primary care professionals must be alert to physical complaints and psychological distress present in organic disorders. The understanding of physiopathological effects of stress and emotional suffering in somatic disorders reinforces that effective care in chronic diseases, such as obesity, has to be organized including these aspects. Treatment needs to be comprehensive so that care can be effective and physical and mental disorders can be properly solved. New therapeutic approaches must be focused on the person, the family and the community instead of focused on the disease. This is essential in the treatment of obesity as it is directly associated with lifestyle, emotional state and stress level, which depends on a change of the individual and his ways of living to be solved. Through this approach, primary care may promote health and prevent diseases.",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

      "title": "Phenomenology and psychiatric origin of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES) is a sudden change in a person's behavior, perception, thinking, or feeling that is usually time limited and resembles, or is mistaken for, epilepsy but does not have the characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that accompanies a true epileptic seizure [1]. It is considered that PNES is a somatic manifestation of mental distress, in response to a psychological conflict or other Stressors [2]. A wide spectrum of clinical presentation includes syncope, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, simple and complex partial seizure, myoclonic seizure, frontal lobe seizures and status epilepticus [3]. Coexistence of epilepsy and PNES is seen in approximately 9% of cases [5]. Between 25-30% of patients referred to tertiary centers and initially diagnosed as refractory epilepsy were on further examination diagnosed as PNES [6,7]. In DSM-IV [12] PNES are usually categorized under conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions. However, psychiatric basis of PNES may be anxiousness (panic attack), somatization or factitious disorder, simulation, dissociative disorders and psychosis [1]. AIM The aim of the study was to establish clinical phenomenology and EEG characteristics as well as basic psychiatric disorder in patients with PNES. METHOD In a retrospective study covering the period from January 1st 1999 till April 31 st 2003, 24 patients (22 female, 2 male) treated at the Institute of Neurology in Belgrade were analyzed. PNES were defined as sudden change in behavior incoherent with epileptiform activity registered on EEG. Possible PNES were determined on the basis of history data and clinical examination during the attack but definitive confirmation was established only by the finding of no ictal EEG changes during typical seizure of each patient. Patients with coexisting epilepsy were included in the study, too. At least two standard EEG (range 2-6, median 4) were performed at the beginning of diagnostic evaluation. Demographic data, clinical presentation (apparent loss of consciousness, type of convulsion and associated clinical signs) and placebo-induced seizures (administration of saline near the cubital vein) with EEG or video-EEG monitoring were analyzed. Basic psychiatric disorder was classified according to DSM IV classification criteria. RESULTS Duration of PNES was 4.7 years (range from 2 months to 30 years). The time from onset to the diagnosis of PNES was 4.5 years. Epilepsy comorbidity was diagnosed in 9 patients (37.5%). The average time of use of antiepileptic drugs (AED) in the group of isolated PNES was 2.4 years and 20% of patients were treated with two or more AED. The vast majority of patients presented with bilateral convulsions (54.16%) with apparent loss of consciousness found in 91.6% of cases. Ictal iwury (16.7%), tongue bite (4.2%) and premonition of the seizure (17.4%) were uncommon. Variability in clinical presentation of seizures was found in over half of patients (57%). Psychological trigger could be determined in over 60% of patients. EEG findings in a group with isolated PNES suggesting the existence of epileptiform activity was found in one case. EEG monitoring of placebo-induced seizure was performed in 20 patients, of whom 19 (95%) showed typical habitual attack with no electroclinical correlate. In 70% of cases conversion disorder DSM-IV criteria were fulfilled. Somatization disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder were found in 3 patients. The diagnosis of factitious disorder was made in one case and only two patients were undiagnosed according to DSM-IV. DISCUSSION Average delay from onset to diagnosis of PNES in larger studies was estimated to be approximately 7 years [8]. Even though diagnostic delay in our study was shorter, organizational reasons for this could not be found. Longer duration of a typical attack (compared to the epileptic seizure), apparent loss of consciousness, bilateral convulsion behavior and significant clinical variability in absence of typical epileptic elements such as tongue bite and ictal iwury could be the main clinical manifestation of PNES. We found rare interictal abnormalities (6.7%) in the group with isolated PNES and significant percentage (77.7%) in patients with coexisting epilepsy which is coherent with other reports [8]. The latest could lead to prolonged delay in appropriate diagnosis and suitable treatment. Clear psychological trigger wasn't noted in whole group of patients (61 %). This, however, is not unusual since PNES represents a chronic disorder with repeated triggering that could lead to less significant role of the same psychological trigger in developed PNES. Even insufficiently resolved in ethical terms, placebo-induced procedure was of huge sensitivity. In clinical practice conversion disorder is hard to differ from malingering or implementation of secondary gain. One could make the conclusion only on the basis of detailed and careful estimation of the symptoms developing context Conversion disorder is more prevalent among women (from 2:1 to 10:1) [4, 13] but modest percentage of affected men could be explained only by limited sample in this study. CONCLUSION PNES is often replaced with epilepsy and in number of cases clinical differentiation is not easy. One should be acquainted with clinical presentation of PNES as well as its psychiatric origin in order to adequately recognize and treat the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "title": "Barriers to the diagnosis of depression in primary care.",
      "abstract": "Approximately 50% of people treated for depression receive treatment in primary care settings. However, studies have demonstrated that specific factors interfere with recognition of this disorder in the primary care setting and decrease the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis. Variables that relate to the patient include lack of awareness and understanding of the nature of the disease and its symptoms so that they can be accurately reported to the physician. Variability in clinical presentation and the presence of comorbid medical disorders also make detection difficult. Complaints of physical symptoms confuse the clinical picture. In addition, patients are ashamed to admit to psychological symptoms of depression and fear the stigma attached to it. Interfering factors that relate to the physician include a lack of knowledge about the disease and lack of training in its management that reduce the physician's ability to render a diagnosis and undermine confidence in the capacity to treat the illness successfully. Reluctance on the part of the physician to inquire frankly about depression also plays a role. Barriers that stem from the system include financing of care under capitated systems, other reimbursement issues, time available to care for patients, and continuity of the physician/patient relationship. A variety of tools are available to assist primary care physicians in the recognition and accurate diagnosis of depression. Use of these tools would increase the recognition and effective management of depression.",

      "abstract": "Background In schizophrenia, patient reacts to sad news with cheerfulness or even laughter (Parathymia/Inappropriate affect). In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Conversion disorders are unexplained symptoms or deficits that mimic neurological problems and affect voluntary motor and sensory functions. Historically, conversion symptoms were thought to reflect underlying psychological conflicts although recent behavioural theories view them as learned responses to stressful life circumstances and emphasize environmental contingencies in the maintenance of the disorder. Although early studies often revealed underlying organic disease in patients initially diagnosed with Conversion Disorder, this now occurs less frequently because of increased sophistication of diagnostic tools and better understanding of neurological disorders. However, misdiagnosis is still common because of reliance on 'negative' diagnostic testing and unvalidated 'positive signs' misinterpreted as indicative of hysteria. Psychological factors may affect the course of almost every major category of disease and in many cases a diagnosis of hysteria is not indicated and the more appropriate diagnosis is Psychological Factors Affecting A Medical Condition. It is not possible to definitively differentiate between conscious and unconscious production of symptoms thus blurring the distinction between Conversion and Factitious disorders.",

Anticipatory grief can be a particular challenge during palliative care. The family is recognized as the major source of social support and the environment in which grief is shared with others. Key risk factors for pathological bereavement outcomes can be identified on admission to palliative care, permitting preventive models of psychological care to be used through palliative care into bereavement. Models of therapy include supportive-expressive, interpersonal, cognitive behavioural, family focused, and specific therapy for complicated grief. Pharmacotherapy can judiciously accompany psychotherapy. Life-cycle issues include bereaved children, siblings, parents, and grief for the very elderly. Grief can be stigmatized and ambiguous in special circumstances, yet positive growth is a desirable outcome from any loss.",

The study of its etiology, usually, signs to situations where the individual is feeling weak, especially related to losses, mourning and melancholy. The emotional aspect seems to play great importance in the etiology, and that is the reason why it is considered a psychosomatic disease. In this context, the pain appears as a repetition of some experience already lived before, that repeats again in unconscious way. This study had the aim to articulate the theoretical presuppositions of medicine and of psychoanalysis to get a more deep understanding about the enigma that is expressed in the fibromyalgia. This disease, in medical aspects, has defined its characteristics, the methods of diagnosis and treatment, even though the etiology remains unknown. On the other hand, the psychoanalysis shows as cause of this disease, the difficulties in the psychicological structure organization, especially, the failure of the paternal function and the difficulties of the subject to deal with his anguish, his demands and his desires. In the expression of the disease, one can observe clearly the connection mind-body in its genesis – psychosomatic disease, and, therefore, it must be studied the diagnosis and the treatment according to the rules established by psychosomatic, aiming at a clinical action that allows the subject to rescue his well-being, through the overcoming of his misunderstanding, his impasses and, consequently, the existential pain.",

Few long-term studies concerning outcome of the depressions exist.

      "title": "[Hypothyroidism--clinical findings, diagnosis, therapy. Thyroid tests should be performed on broad indications].",
      "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is a clinical entity resulting from deficiency of thyroid hormones or, more rarely, from their impaired activity at tissue level. It is a common condition, with a prevalence of 1.9 per cent in women, and the prevalence increases with age. Hypothyroidism may be congenital or acquired, primary or secondary, chronic or transient. Primary hypothyroidism is caused by disease or treatment which destroys the thyroid gland or interferes with thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Autoimmune thyroiditis is the predominant cause of primary hypothyroidism in countries such as Sweden where severe iodine deficiency is non-existent. Another cause of primary hypothyroidism, chronic or transient, is previous radio-iodine or surgical treatment of hypothyroidism. In secondary or central hypothyroidism, which is very rare, there is a lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or TSH activity, due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause. The clinical features of hypothyroidism are dependent on the patient's age, the presence of other disease, and the rate at which hypothyroidism develops. As thyroid hormones are universal determinants of organ function, there may be a multiplicity of symptoms. Particularly in the elderly, the clinical features may be atypical, and the diagnosis easily missed. First line tests for hypothyroidism are analyses of the concentrations of free thyroxine (T4) and TSH in serum. In primary hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH high. In central hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH generally low or normal, though slightly increased levels of biologically inactive TSH may also occur. Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterised by a normal serum level of T4, an increased level of TSH, and the absence of clinical symptoms. When a diagnosis of chronic hypothyroidism is confirmed, treatment with laevothyroxine is started, the initial dose being adjusted to the age and general condition of the patient, and the duration and severity of hypothyroidism. As a rule, full thyroxine replacement therapy should bring the serum TSH level into the normal range. In central hypothyroidism, laevothyroxine treatment is similar, but pituitary function must be evaluated and, if necessary, corticosteroid replacement be instituted before laevothyroxine treatment is started.",

      "title": "SINTOMAS DEPRESSIVOS EM ACADÊMICOS DE UMA UNIVERSIDADE PÚBLICA NO OESTE DO ESTADO DO PARÁ, RELATO DE EXPERIÊNCIA",
      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A depressao e um disturbio do afeto e/ou do humor, que e caracterizado por sintomas como, piora do sono, do apetite, da auto-estima, pela tristeza, sentimento de culpa, entre outros. O individuo depressivo tem dificuldade em descrever experiencias emocionais positivas, sendo pouco aberto a sentimentos otimistas. Alem disso, na depressao nao existe apenas queixa de tristeza, mas tambem ha mudancas de humor que culminam em crises frequentes de explosao de raiva, que levam ao desgaste da saude fisica e emocional, prejuizos no convivio social, na aprendizagem e ideias e/ou tentativas frequentes de suicidio. Esse transtorno e considerado uma pandemia e a terceira maior causa a nivel global de doencas. Sao inumeros os fatores que podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento da depressao, como por exemplo, o baixo suporte social, a presenca de eventos estressantes, pensamentos negativos, problemas financeiros, entre outros. Alguns dados encontrados nos universitarios nesta pesquisa, sao considerados elevados, no que tange ao processo depressivo, e ganham maior destaque ainda quando comparados com a populacao em geral. Isso e possivel, pois e nessa fase academica que se exige muito esforco do adolescente ou jovem adulto, onde o mesmo deve aprender a lidar com uma gama de responsabilidades que estarao presentes em sua vida futura, tanto como academico, quanto como profissional. Estes incluem a adaptacao de cumprimento de prazos e horarios, a distância dos pais e demais familiares, a falta de motivacao para os estudos, dentre outros conflitos internos e/ou externos. Diante dessas informacoes, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em relatar a presenca de sinais e sintomas depressivos encontrados em academicos de uma instituicao de ensino superior em Santarem- PA, atraves de uma escuta qualificada. Desenvolvimento : Este estudo trata-se de um relato de experiencia acerca das vivencias durante uma acao em saude que ocorreu no dia 24 de abril de 2017 desenvolvida por academicos de enfermagem da Universidade do Estado do Para (UEPA) Campus XII-Santarem, a acao foi baseada na metodologia ativa da problematizacao segundo o Projeto Politico Pedagogico (PPP) do curso de enfermagem da UEPA para a Atividade Integrada em Saude que e um momento em que o academico de enfermagem integra todos os eixos da grade curricular do semestre, escolhendo assim um tema a ser abordado, assim como o publico, que foi composto de academicos dos cursos contemplados na universidade: enfermagem, musica, educacao fisica, medicina e fisioterapia. A tematica foi abordada atraves de acao educativa em saude, organizada pelos academicos do curso de enfermagem com diversos topicos como: alimentacao, avaliacao de risco para o desenvolvimento de doencas cronicas, avaliacao de medidas antropometricas e, nesta atividade, avaliacao da saude mental com a investigacao da existencia de sintomas depressivos. Durante a acao os academicos de enfermagem, em um primeiro momento, distribuiram folders contendo informacoes sobre a depressao e, posteriormente conversaram individualmente com cada academico que, de forma voluntaria, concordaram discutir sobre sintomas que, de acordo com o CID-10, poderiam estar sentindo. Durante a conversa os sintomas investigados foram: fadiga aumentada ou perda de energia fisica e mental, perda de interesse e prazer, classificados como sintomas fundamentais; apetite diminuido, atividade diminuida, auto-estima e autoconfianca diminuida, concentracao e atencao diminuida, sentimento de culpa e inutilidade, pensamentos e/ou atos lesivos ou suicidas, sono perturbado, visao pessimista do futuro, classificados como sintomas episodicos. Alem disso, a acao contou com a ajuda de um psicologo que atendeu os participantes que apresentaram sintomas graves da depressao. Os participantes que apresentaram maior necessidade foram orientados a buscar tratamento efetivo com intervencao de psicologo. Resultados : A maioria dos entrevistados mostraram-se bastante interessados no assunto e nao demonstravam muita timidez, apresentaram-se bem a vontade e com disposicao para dialogar, o que de certa forma surpreendeu a equipe, que esperava uma resistencia por parte dos academicos, com isso observou-se facilitacao do trabalho para a equipe dos entrevistadores. Apos a entrevista, os academicos de enfermagem, organizadores da acao, detectaram uma alta incidencia de sintomas fundamentais e episodicos em um numero significativos dos universitarios, o que pode ser considerado uma situacao preocupante. No decorrer da acao, muitos academicos participantes, relataram o quanto consideravam acoes desse genero, importantes na universidade, por sentirem-se sobrecarregados pelas atividades academicas, desorientados, desanimados e com pensamentos pessimistas. Podem ser classificados como poucas as acoes voltadas para os academicos, sobretudo, os academicos da area da saude, ja que eles sao os principais responsaveis por promoverem esse tipo de acoes e que acabam deixando de se cuidar, nao lembrando-se que tambem precisam de cuidado e atencao. Deste modo, e inegavel a grande satisfacao de poder contribuir de alguma forma para esta comunidade e acredita-se que, todos os academicos tiveram uma boa oportunidade de serem ouvidos de forma mais qualificada por um profissional apto a lhe dar orientacoes essenciais que visem a prevencao diagnostica, alem de recuperacao e promocao da saude mental. Consideracoes Finais : Apos a acao em saude, alguns academicos que se ausentaram no dia em que a acao ocorreu procuraram a equipe afim de, saberem se haveria outra acao semelhante, alegando que gostariam de serem ouvidos ou ate mesmo referindo interesse de um amigo (a) na consulta psicologica. Essa experiencia aponta para a necessidade de que academicos na area da saude devem cuidar da saude mental de forma frequente sem negligenciar as tensoes e o estresse advindos da propria universidade, antes de serem lancados no mercado de trabalho. Alem da necessidade de acompanhamento psicologico para os academicos nas proprias universidades, sejam elas publicas ou privadas, no decorrer da formacao afim de manter a saude mental e de prevenir, diagnosticar ou ainda tratar quadros depressivos e outras doencas mentais que podem comprometer seu rendimento academico e a sua saude geral, visando reduzir dados crescentes relacionados a sintomatologia da depressao em universitarios. Essa experiencia mostrou que mesmo em cursos da area da saude, a saude mental ainda e pouco debatida, precisando assim, de uma atencao tanto dos academicos com sua propria saude, como da instituicao de ensino, promovendo um espaco e profissionais capacitados que possam auxiliar enquanto o academico estiver em formacao.",

In formulating a differential diagnosis, clinicians must include medical disorders. The terms organic and functional, psychological and physical, reflect the subjective experience of mind as separate from body or brain; yet all mental events have a brain basis. Diagnoses may represent descriptive categories, but the goal is for diagnoses to be based on causation. Making a diagnosis is a challenging task given the individual variation in presentation, vast amounts of clinical information, large number of possible solutions, clinician's complex mental processes, and limits of human perception.",

Some disorders are peculiar to the psychotic patient, such as the exhaustion syndrome, and megacolon, and some disorders are rarely seen in the psychotic patient, such as acute bronchial asthma, hay fever, and rheumatoid arthritis. Another distinctive feature is that many patients who are developing or suffering from serious physical illnesses make no complaints or distort or disguise their complaints so that the physician may be misled or must pay special attention to unusual and somewhat atypical forms of behavior. Interviewing the patient to get a clear description of the complaints may involve a physician in the psychotic thinking of the patient.

Critical analysis of the pertinent literature leaves some question as to the validity of these observations.Clinical analysis of 34 patients with essential tremor, personally observed during a four-year period, reveals this to be a monosymptomatic condition. The tremor was usually of both a postural and action type and resting tremor was not observed. There were no other neurological abnormalities. Serious disability was infrequent and, when present, was related to upper limb tremor. Essential tremor should be readily distinguishable from other central nervous system diseases but it may be confused with Parkinson's disease or cerebellar ataxia.",

En el presente estudio, se expone un caso poco comun y atipico de accidente domestico, que lamentablemente culmino con la muerte de la victima. Se trata de una anciana de 72 anos que, segun datos aportados por la instruccion policial, fue hallada en su domicilio, tendida en la cocina, con una herida incisa penetrante en la cavidad toracica.

EnglishIn Legal Medicine, there are frequently cases having an accidental medico-legal etiology in its more varied situations. An accident is any spontaneous traumatic or morbid fact or phenomenon that happens in a healthy individual or in the course of an illness. The wideness of this definition terms obliges us to take into the account that the different kinds of accidents are conditioned by multiple phenomena of unforeseeable and uncontrollable character. In the current work, we expose an uncommon, atypical home accident, unfortunately ending in the victim’s death; it deals with an elder woman aged 72 years who, according with the data provided by the police instruction was found lying in the kitchen of her house with an incised penetrating wound in the thoracic cavity.

      "title": "Genetic and Environmental Factors in Autism",
      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, and verbal and nonverbal communication as well as limited and repetitive behaviours. Although symptomatology of autism may be noticed around early months, diagnosis generally occurs around 24-36 months, however in some cases diagnosis may be delayed to adulthood [1]. Since behavioural symptoms and the degree of functional impairment are variable, the au‐ tistic disorder is described as a heterogenous symptom cluster of varying etiological and pathological basis [2]. Described as a multifactorial disorder created by interaction of neuro‐ logic, immunologic, environmental, and genetic factors, autistic disorder has no definite cause [3, 4]. In many cases in whom the etiology remains unclear are diagnosed as idiopath‐ ic autism or non-syndromic autism [5, 6]. Seventy percent of cases with idiopathic autism have basic symptoms without physical abnormalities whereas 30% have complex autism in which dysmorphic features are detected such as microcephaly and/or structural brain mal‐ formations [7]. Autism is associated with other syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome, Down Syndrome, and tuberosclerosis in 5-25% of the cases ([8, 9]. Although phenotypic het‐ erogeneity is the biggest challenge for research efforts directed to identify autism etiology [10], currently it is widely accepted that environmental and genetic factors play essential role in genesis of autistic disorder thanks to a recent advance in research techniques related to biological factors and widespread studies in this field [11, 12].",

      "abstract": "Η παρά τη κλίνη εξέταση των νευρολογικών διαταραχών, μέσω μίας τυπικής νευρολογικής κλινικής εξέτασης θεωρείται ως μία άμεση και ανέξοδη μέθοδος για την αξιολόγηση της εγκεφαλικής δυσλειτουργίας στη σχιζοφρένεια. Κατά τη διάρκεια των τελευταίων σαράντα ετών οι ερευνητικές εργασίες αναφέρουν συστηματικά την αυξημένη παρουσία των ήπιων νευρολογικών σημείων (ΗΝΣ) στους ασθενείς με σχιζοφρένεια, σε σύγκριση με τον υγιή πληθυσμό ή τους μη-ψυχωτικούς ψυχιατρικούς ασθενείς. Ωστόσο, η λειτουργική τους συσχέτιση παραμένει ασαφής και η ειδικότητά τους έχει συχνά αμφισβητηθεί, αν και υπάρχουν ενδείξεις μίας σχετικής ειδικότητας ως προς τη διάγνωση ή τη συμπτωματολογία. Παράγοντες όπως οι ανεπιθύμητες ενέργειες των νευροληπτικών φαρμάκων, το φύλο, η ηλικία ή το οικογενειακό ψυχιατρικό ιστορικό, θεωρείται ότι επηρεάζουν τα αποτελέσματα της νευρολογικής εκτίμησης, ενώ μόνο ένας σχετικά μικρός αριθμός ερευνών αναφέρει δεδομένα μίας μακροχρόνιας παρακολούθησης των ΗΝΣ σε έναν επαρκή αριθμό ατόμων προκειμένου να αξιολογηθεί μία πιθανή έκπτωση των νευρολογικών λειτουργιών. Η παρούσα μελέτη προσπάθησε να διερευνήσει τη συχνότητα και τη φύση των ΗΝΣ σε ασθενείς με σχιζοφρένεια, καθώς και σε μία ομάδα υγιών μαρτύρων. Στοχεύσαμε στη διερεύνηση των διαφορών μεταξύ των μελετώμενων πληθυσμών και των συσχετίσεων μεταξύ συγκεκριμένων ομάδων νευρολογικών σημείων και κλινικών, κοινωνικοδημογραφικών και θεραπευτικών χαρακτηριστικών του πληθυσμού των ασθενών, κατά την αρχική εκτίμηση, καθώς και μετά την πάροδο δώδεκα μηνών. Συνολικά εντάχθηκαν στη μελέτη 133 νοσηλευόμενοι και εξωτερικοί ασθενείς. Οι διαγνώσεις τέθηκαν βάση της ελληνικής έκδοσης 5.0.0. της σύντομης διεθνούς νευροψυχιατρικής συνέντευξης (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, MINI Greek version 5.0.0.). Επιπλέον, 122 υγιείς μάρτυρες συμπεριλήφθηκαν στη μελέτη και αντιστοιχήθηκαν ως προς το φύλο και την ηλικία με τον πληθυσμό των ασθενών. Όλοι οι ενταχθέντες στη μελέτη υποβλήθηκαν αρχικά σε νευρολογική εξέταση εστιασμένη στη διερεύνηση των ΗΝΣ, βάση της Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES) κλίμακας. Τα εξωπυραμιδικά συμπτώματα εκτιμήθηκαν με τις κλίμακες Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SARS) και Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS). Τα ανευρεθέντα κλινικά συμπτώματα του πληθυσμού της μελέτης αξιολογήθηκαν με τις κλίμακες Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory form Y (STAI-T and STAI-S) και Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Τέλος, η εκτίμηση της γενικής λειτουργικότητας έγινε βάση των οδηγιών της Αμερικάνικης Ψυχιατρικής Εταιρείας (κλίμακα GAF), ενώ η προτίμηση χρήσης των χεριών εκτιμήθηκε με την κλίμακα Annett Hand Preference Questionnaire (AHPQ). Για λόγους στατιστικής ανάλυσης υιοθετήθηκε τιμή p τέτοια ώστε να είναι επαρκής για πολλαπλές συγκρίσεις και ορίστηκε σε επίπεδο p&lt;0.001. Για την ανάλυση των δεδομένων χρησιμοποιήθηκε το t-test για ένα δείγμα, η δοκιμασία x2, η δοκιμασία t-test για ανεξάρτητα δείγματα και ο συντελεστής συσχέτισης Pearson, όπου αυτό απαιτείτο. Συμπεράσματα: Τα ήπια νευρολογικά σημεία είναι εξαιρετικά συχνά σε ασθενείς με σχιζοφρένεια (90%), ενώ μάλλον σπάνια σε υγιείς μάρτυρες (12%), εύρημα κοινό σε όλες τις υποομάδες στις οποίες κατηγοριοποιούνται. Η παρουσία τους έχει μορφή δομικών χαρακτηριστικών (trait-like), με σταθερότητα στο χρόνο, και είναι ανεξάρτητα από κοινωνικοδημογραφικούς παράγοντες, κλινικά χαρακτηριστικά της νόσου και την υπάρχουσα φαρμακοθεραπεία, αν και η ύπαρξή τους ενδεχομένως υποδεικνύει νόσο με φτωχότερη έκβαση. Δε φαίνεται να επιδεινώνονται με το πέρασμα της ηλικίας, τουλάχιστον μέχρι την ηλικία των 65 ετών.",

Burnout syndrome develops as the sequence of emotional exhaustion, followed by depersonalization as a coping mechanism, and which finally manifests itself as feelings of professional dissatisfaction and anguish. If burnout continues into residency and later into medical practice, it will affect the physician’s functioning and quality of life.

These were extreme irritability, pronounced startle reaction, bizarre tremors and automatic movements, some loss of memory, headaches and a decided drop in efficiency.

A la suite des premieres observations de troubles de l'action et de l'affect (apathie, apragmatisme, indifference affective, perte d'interet), consecutives a la destruction, selective mais bilaterale, des noyaux pallidaux, est nee la notion de syndrome athymhormique, concu comme un trouble specifique de la capacite des sujets a convertir leurs affects en action. Outre cette pathologie de la motivation proprement dite, les patients decrivent souvent, mais non toujours, une experience tres particuliere de vide mental, laissant presumer que les systemes en cause controlent egalement certains aspects de l'activite mentale spontanee. Toutefois, cette absence d'activite physique et mentale spontanee contraste avec la preservation des capacites motrices et intellectuelles, lorsu'elles sont stimulees exterieurement. Parallelement, ces constatations cliniques ont permis de devoiler un aspect insoupconne des fonctions des noyaux gris centraux, en montrant que, de la meme maniere que cela avait ete precedemment decrit chez l'animal, la motivation humaine est dependante de l'activite d'un circuit cortico-sous-cortical bilateral centre sur le couple striato-pallidal, plus specialement dans leurs portions anatomiquement connectees aux elements du systeme limbique. Ce circuit limbique' comprend ainsi la portion ventrale du striato-pallidum (noyau caude et pallidum interne), le thalamus dorso-median, le cortex frontal median. L'analyse des cas publies de syndrome athymhormique suggere qu'une lesion bilaterale de ce circuit, a n'importe quel point de son trajet cortico-sous-cortical, est necessaire et suffisante pour provoquer les elements du syndrome athymhormique. Outre son interet neurophysiologique et clinique, l'introduction de ce nouveau concept en neuropsychologie ouvre des perspectives interessantes pour la physiopathologie de certaines maladies psychiatriques.",

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms. DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders—dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder—as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder—other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediately after the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation. In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]). DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately. A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent. Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder. DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option—\"other specified dissociative disorder\"—for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).",

      "abstract": "As people live longer, the burden of cognitive impairment to elderly patients, their families and society becomes increasingly common and important. The loss of independence, a reduction in the quality of life and increased mortality are possible correlates to the mental disintegration. Cognitive dysfunction following major surgery on the elderly is a significant problem which adds to other cognitive impairments caused by neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular impairments and other causes. There are challenges in reviewing the literature because of many methodological concerns. There is no standard definition; the diagnosis is made only by the results of neuropsychological tests which are not standardised for this purpose; test results are analysed by different statistical methods (some of them inappropriate); controls are often absent or poorly matched; and pre-existing mild cognitive impairment, which affects 10 to 20% of people older than 65 years and is similar to the subtle cognitive impairment following surgery, is not sought for and recognised. Reviews of the subject have varied from descriptions such as ‘a well recognised and significant problem’ to ‘a hypothetical phenomenon for which there is no International Statistical Classification of Disease (ICD-9) code, and no Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) code’. This article examines both sides of the spectrum in a detailed review which explains the necessary psychological ‘jargon’, discusses the methods used and points to areas of future research.",

Self-disturbances in schizophrenia can be explained from the standpoint of an abnormal sense of agency, such as thought broadcasting as an over-attribution of agency and thought insertion as an under-attribution of agency. Delusional perception is often accompanied by impairment of perceptual organization; delusional mood and delusions might result from the reorganization of the fragmented perceptual field, as well as a loss of reality.

Over the years, physiologists have probed into almost every aspect of the soma in the quest for some abnormality which would account for the schizophrenic syndrome. Many possibilities have been considered, investigated to a degree and then abandoned when definitive answers were not forthcoming. A dominant approach throughout has been the search for some psychotoxic material circulating in schizophrenic body fluids. Activity has been spurred by the recurrent recognition that chemical agents such as the ergot alkaloids, mescaline, bulbocapnine and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25), could induce in normal persons transient mental disturbances similar to those seen in schizophrenia.",

Like other rare disease patients, individuals with CHH/KS frequently experience feelings of isolation, shame and alienation. Unlike many rare diseases, CHH/KS is not life threatening and effective treatments are available. Nevertheless, it remains a profoundly life-altering condition with psychosocial distress on a par with untreatable or life-limiting disease. Patients with CHH/KS frequently express lasting adverse psychological, emotional, social and psychosexual effects resulting from disrupted puberty. They also frequently experience a ‘diagnostic odyssey’, characterized by distressing and convoluted medical referral pathways, lack-of-information, misinformation, and sometimes-incorrect diagnoses. Unnecessary delays in diagnosis and treatment-initiation can significantly contribute to poor body image and self-esteem. Such experiences can erode confidence and trust in medical professionals as well as undermine long-term adherence to treatment - with negative sequelae on health and wellbeing. This review provides a summary of the psychological aspects of CHH/KS and outlines an approach to comprehensive care that spans medical management as well as appropriate attention, care and referrals to peer-to-peer support and mental health services to ameliorate the psychological aspects of CHH/KS.",

At the heart of many of these outcomes is the stress process, which under acute conditions can be considered adaptive and essential for survival. To be sure, stress due to trauma is a normal response, despite the fact that emotional and psychophysiological processes may be at abnormal levels for a period of time. Disordered responses may follow an event which is outside the realm of normal human experience and which involves extreme threat or privation, including natural disasters, humanmade events such as war, fires, airplane crashes, chemical, nuclear, or toxic accidents, and more individual level traumas such as victimization by crime, rape, or automobile accidents. The vast majority of victims of these events experience only transient symptoms and recover readily. However, some victims appear to experience long-lasting stress following some kinds of trauma. Under some conditions, stress appears to persist and may form the basis of PTSD. In such cases, abnormal levels of response persist for abnormally long periods of time. Davidson and Baum (1986) suggested that situations which are not necessarily intense, but which pose lasting threats, may be associated with persistent symptoms of stress, arid that these chronic stress reactions are very similar to posttraumatic stress disorder, and may differ only in the intensity of the symptoms.",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

      "abstract": "Prejudicial beliefs, emotions, and behaviours cause discrimination against people labeled as mentally ill. This stigmatization is sometimes internalized by the patients, leading to self-stigmatization. Specific features and impacts of stigmatization and self-stigmatization in patients with bipolar illness are the subjects of this review.Studies were identified through PUBMED, Web of Science and Scopus databases as well as existing reviews. The search terms included \"bipolar disorder\", \"stigma\", \"self-stigma\" psychoeducation\", \"psychotherapy\", \"psychosocial treatment\". Key articles listed in reference lists were searched.Considerable recent evidence indicates that bipolar patients and their families are stigmatized, and that this stigmatization affects their quality of life as well as social functioning. The severity of stigmatization in bipolar disorder is greater than that in people with depression. There is also evidence of self-stigmatization which further decreases the quality of life. Stigmatization and self-stigmatization were shown to be one of the barriers that delay or prevent effective treatment, and thus exert adverse effects on the outcomes of bipolar disorder.Stigma affects the experience of illness as well as social functioning in patients with bipolar disorder. The impact of stigma on the lives and treatment outcomes of patients with bipolar disorder mandates intensive effort of mental health research and policy to address this problem. Much has been done against the stigmatization of the mentally ill. But the fight against stigma remains a fundamental objective of health programs for mental health.",

      "title": "What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?",
      "abstract": "‘Placebo’ was used to describe fake substances or rituals used by medieval physicians to ‘please’, or assuage discomfort, in patients for whom no cure was available. This placatory perception of placebos led many to regard them as obsolete, permissible only as a comparator agent in clinical trials. Yet, placebo use by healthcare workers is relatively common,1 mainly to distinguish between organic and functional disease, identify malingerers, establish the psychological origin of a condition (to both physician and patient alike) and placate patients who insist on potentially harmful measures when the physician believes that no treatment is indicated.2\r\n\r\nPsychogenic disorders are somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause.3 Features consistent with psychogenic conditions include: (1) presence of associated psychiatric disorders; (2) lack of concern (la belle indifference) or an exaggerated emotional response; (3) disease manifesting only when observed, and not when alone or thought to be unobserved; (4) bizarre or inconsistent signs; (5) presence of emotional or situational triggers; (6) multiple inexplicable physical symptoms; (7) failure to respond to therapy; (8) presence of a medical background; and (9) disease is triggered or ameliorated by placebo.4,5\r\n\r\nManagement of psychogenic disorders is difficult, as these patients often have an underlying organic disease.4 Prognosis for functional recovery is generally poor, and successful management requires a multi-disciplinary approach featuring the psychiatrist in a pivotal role. Empathy and a nonjudgemental manner should be used, and it is often helpful to invoke a neurobiological explanation of the symptoms in order to foster trust, acceptance, understanding and recovery.6\r\n\r\nShould placebos be used in managing psychogenic disease? In its favour are the potential salutary effects and absence of side effects, coupled with the low success rate of psychotherapy and potential adverse effects of psychopharmacotherapy. On the other hand, many are uncomfortable with the ethics of administering an inert substance purporting to be ‘active’, on the basis that it smacks of deception.\r\n\r\nPlacebos have opposing roles in clinical and research settings. A meta-analysis concluded that giving placebo equals ‘no treatment’;7 but there is physiologic evidence demonstrating the power of the placebo effect, which refers to perceived health benefits from prescription of medically inert substances.7 Studies in depressed patients have demonstrated similar metabolic responses to placebo and fluoxetine,7 just as positron emission tomographic (PET) studies in parkinsonian patients have shown robust dopamine release in response to placebo.7 It can be seen how the placebo effect can confound in clinical trials. In fact, the perceived benefits from sham surgery in surgical trials in osteoarthritis8 and surgery for Parkinson's disease,9 have resulted in the move to include a sham surgery control arm in surgical trials.9\r\n\r\nThus, in clinical practice, the physician prescribes a placebo in the hope that it will produce a therapeutic effect: such an effect is anathema to research. Ethicists have coined the term, ‘knowledge framing’, to describe desirable treatment effects arising from proper presentation of information to patients during the clinical encounter, distinct from the placebo (unwanted) effect in clinical trials.10\r\n\r\nWhilst debate rages about whether it is permissible to harness the placebo effect to treat psychogenic disease, few would condone placebo use to treat organic diseases for which appropriate therapy is available. Purists maintain that any practice involving deceit of patients is inappropriate, and that they must be informed of the inert nature of the placebo when it is administered.7 Unfortunately, complete disclosure is liable to decrease the utility of the placebo as treatment or diagnostic test (in which placebo is administered to trigger or halt psychogenic disease). Disallowing use of placebo because it is considered to be unethical would remove from the physician's armamentarium an important tool to diagnose and potentially treat psychogenic disease. As a result, such patients would be susceptible to the adverse effects of medications which would otherwise prove unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the criticisms levied against placebo therapy is that it reflects a paternalistic attitude—that of an omniscient doctor who is the best judge of what is right for the patient, making decisions for the patient without need for patient consultation or agreement. It is feared that an erroneous judgement on the part of the physician would lead to his withholding appropriate treatment for the patient who is adjudged psychogenic or less serious.7 This scenario is, unfortunately, not as far fetched as one would hope. Disorders such as cervical dystonia and writer's cramp, now accepted as organic diseases, were once thought to be hysterical in origin.4\r\n\r\nWith the development of the field of medical ethics, we have evolved from the principles of paternalism and beneficence to embracing respect for patient autonomy, i.e. the right or freedom of individuals to make decisions on their own behalf.11 As doctors, we must be mindful of the dictum, primum non nocere, and strive to do right for our patients. Several questions remain: is the patient afflicted with psychogenic disease compos mentis? If not, can a relative or guardian make the decision to proceed with the placebo test or placebo therapy? It is likely that, however beneficent the intent, it can be argued that knowingly deceiving a patient by declaring placebo to be an active drug is an unethical act. It would be far better, perhaps, to practise knowledge framing and provide a neurobiological explanation, describing the placebo as a harmless agent, whose administration is meant to bring about improvement in the disorder.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a place for placebo therapy, as long as: its use is transparent and the patient's autonomy and right-to-know is respected; it builds on and respects the patient-doctor relationship; it tolerates and even encourages the patient's right-to-choice, whilst developing an appropriate therapeutic concept for the patient; and it is engendered by care and concern for the patient.7 Thus, we would submit that the placebo is useful as a diagnostic test to distinguish between psychogenic and organic disease. Upon exclusion of organic pathology and confirmation of diagnosis, a trial of placebo therapy may avoid the need for harmful psychopharmacotherapy, though it may instead be used as an adjunct to psychiatric counselling and drug treatment. Of course, we would not recommend the placebo as standard therapy for all psychogenic disease, but would argue for acceptance of its place in the physician's pharmacopoeia.",

Distributed with this issue of Pediatrics in Review is the Guide for Record Review on migraine written by the American Board of Pediatrics, which states, \"Because there is no diagnostic test for migraine, a careful history provides the most important clues to the diagnosis.\" Headache is a common complaint in the pediatric office; it can be part of an acute illness or an isolated symptom that plagues the patient for years. Usually headache is annoying; sometimes it can be debilitating. In the worst case, but rarely, headache can be a manifestation of a serious underlying condition, such as a brain tumor. The physician's first task is to ascertain whether such a disorder is present. The history will help to determine this, but physical findings are especially important. A physical examination, with special attention to neurologic findings, can detect signs of a disease or disorder. Usually, results of the examination will reassure patient and physician, especially if the headaches have been occurring for many months and the findings are normal. The clinician's next step is to determine the mechanism for the patient's discomfort, which will dictate appropriate therapy.",

      "title": "Is Delirium the Cognitive Harbinger of Frailty in Older Adults? A Review about the Existing Evidence",
      "abstract": "Frailty is a clinical syndrome defined by the age-related depletion of the individual's homeostatic reserves, determining an increased susceptibility to stressors and disproportionate exposure to negative health changes. The physiological systems that are involved in the determination of frailty are mutually interrelated, so that when decline starts in a given system, implications may also regard the other systems. Indeed, it has been shown that the number of abnormal systems is more predictive of frailty than those of the abnormalities in any particular system. Delirium is a transient neurocognitive disorder, characterized by an acute onset and fluctuating course, inattention, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral abnormalities, that complicates one out of five hospital admissions. Delirium is independently associated with the same negative outcomes of frailty and, like frailty, its pathogenesis is usually multifactorial, depending on complex inter-relationships between predisposing and precipitating factors. By definition, a somatic cause should be identified, or at least suspected, to diagnose delirium. Delirium and frailty potentially share multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms and pathways, meaning that they could be thought of as the two sides to the same coin. This review aims at summarizing the existing evidence, referring both to human and animal models, to postulate that delirium may represent the cognitive harbinger of a state of frailty in older persons experiencing an acute clinical event.",

      "title": "Liječenje seksualne disfunkcije",
      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions or quantitative disorders of sexual drive are difficulties that an individual or a couple may experience at any stage of sexual activity as pain or difficulty in achieving sexual drive. Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

      "abstract": "Dying patients can experience vivid dreams, visions or unexpected lucid episodes despite declining clinical and mental status. This review examines patient end-of-life experiences (ELEs) and their implications to the mind-brain relationship (MBR). A Scoping Review (ScR) was conducted, searching major academic databases for qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods studies. Data were synthesized narratively and presented in distribution graphs. Twenty-one papers (20 studies) were included from 1,391 citations, mostly U.S.-based (52%) and descriptive in nature. End-of-life dreams and visions (ELDVs) occur in cognitively intact dying patients, are vividly recalled, often feature deceased loved ones, offering meaning, comfort, and acceptance, suggesting sustained psychological and spiritual activity despite physical decline. Terminal lucidity (TL), though rarer, is a striking phenomenon, marked by the sudden reemergence of clarity, memory, and communication in severely cognitively impaired individuals across various pathologies, challenging the assumption that consciousness is solely a product of brain function. Patient ELEs suggest a possible mind-brain dissociation in the dying process. As research on ELDVs and TL continues to expand, future rigorous studies incorporating clinical controls and neuroimaging will be essential in determining whether these experiences are solely brain-generated or indicative of a broader understanding of consciousness beyond the brain.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a disease itself but mostly a clinical sign of an underlying disease. Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation. Agrypnia excitata is the term that aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome.",

In this case, we describe a patient with no prior medical or psychiatric history having a cAVM diagnosed after showing psychotic symptoms (delusion and disorganized thoughts and behavior). The deep 4 × 5 cm cAVM was discovered after admitting the patient to psychiatric ward, the neurological cause has been considered after a recorded seizure, which brings the following question: Is the clinical presentation a direct result of the cAVM or is it postictal?

The two hypotheses explaining this case report have a low rate of occurring making this a rare case.

      "abstract": "Low back pain is a common problem affecting most adults at some point during their lifetime. At any one time, around 1 in 5 adults will report symptoms of low back pain, rising to 40% when asked if they have experienced symptoms during the previous month. The majority of people who experience an episode of low back pain will improve over time. However a sizeable proportion experience repeated episodes or recurrences, and some report continuous symptoms for many years. A wide range of factors are linked to both the onset and persistence of low back pain. Some studies have related age and gender to low back pain, but the link overall is equivocal. Work-related factors such as heavy lifting, and socio-demographic factors such as smoking and obesity have been linked with the onset of low back pain. High levels of functional impairment and the presence of pain radiating to the leg have been cited as factors associated with a poor prognosis among primary care consulters with low back pain. Other characteristics associated with both the development and the persistence of low back pain include psychological factors such as depression and anxiety and workplace factors such as job satisfaction. Low back pain places large demands on health, social and welfare systems. Further research is needed to identify practical interventions to reduce this burden from low back pain.",

The canonical phenotype of the Parkinson’s disease Dementia (PD-D) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) includes deficit of attention, executive and visuospatial functions, and presents often with apathy, hallucinations, delusions, excessive daytime sleepiness, or sleep disorders. However, the clinical expression may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive disorders. Thus, while clinicians rely on phenomenological patterns to infer the disease causing the cognitive impairment, the inference is weakened by the heterogeneous clinical expression of the disease. In addition, recent post-mortem studies seem to undermine the supposed pathology-phenotype coherence, making it more and more unreliable the diagnosis based on symptoms. The lack of coherence between phenotype and pathology may support the speculation about a common mechanism underlying the progression of the disease. While it is very likely that a distinct, specific causal event determines the disease itself, the progression might well follow common patterns. A number of observations suggest that progressive diseases, which cause cognitive impairment, share a prion-like mechanism. A seeding process is supposed to account for the spreading of the lesion.",

However, they may occur individually or together and it may be difficult to decide which is which. When a person describes his own experience as religious and another observes this as mental illness they are unlikely to be commenting on precisely the same phenomena. The first person is describing an internal experience whilst the latter is inferring from observed behaviour. It is important for psychiatrists and mental health professionals to recognize that there is a spiritual dimension for their patients (and for themselves), and for pastoral theologians to form a concept of mental illness.

En ese sentido, muchas especialidades médicas pueden reclamar su relación con la Psiquiatría, puesto que son innumerables las enfermedades que tienen nexo con signos y síntomas psiquiátricos (por ejemplo, la enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal en Gastroenterología; el asma bronquial en Neumología, entre otras). No obstante, con la Dermatología la relación es mucho más evidente. La Psicodermatología es una especialidad que surge de la conjunción de dos ramas aparentemente divergentes de la Medicina: la Psiquiatría y la Dermatología. En Psicodermatología, algunos pacientes presentan enfermedades principalmente dermatológicas con comorbilidades psicosociales secundarias, mientras que otros tienen trastornos psiquiátricos primarios con sintomatología cutánea significativa. Así también, debido a que varias enfermedades dermatológicas no solo se acompañan frecuentemente de dolor e incomodidad, sino que son inmediatamente visibles para los demás, las personas afectadas por estas condiciones pueden sufrir consecuencias sociales y emocionales. Con base en lo anterior, este artículo de revisión presenta los conceptos, nosología y modelos de abordaje de esta ciencia médica, haciendo hincapié que, debido a la interacción permanente entre la mente y la piel, se hace necesario que el paciente sea tratado como una unidad constituida por varios niveles, incluyendo aspectos cutáneos, emocionales y mentales.",

This neurosis may be latent as any other inherent tendency to neuropathic instability may be and often is, until some psychical or pathological cause calls it into morbid activity. While hysteria is essentially an imitative and functional disturbance of the peychomotor, sensory and ganglionic centers, it is no more unreasonable to expect its development in conjunction with grave organic lesions of the cord or brain, than to anticipate pain or spasm from profound central disease or even from multiple neuritis of the motor nerves extending to the cord centers or involving contiguous peripheral sensory nerve fibers. The time has fully come, in the progress of neural pathology and clinical neurology, to recognize this fact and realize its true significance in our clinical",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "title": "ADVANCES IN COMPREHENSIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT",
      "abstract": "Pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.”106 Pain is the most common reason a patient presents to a physician for evaluation.80, 81 As expected, this physician is rarely a psychiatrist. If the patient suffers from chronic pain, defined by Bonica12 as pain persisting on a daily basis for a month beyond what would be considered the usual time for healing of underlying pathology, then many specialists are commonly involved in the care of the patient. The psychiatrist offers special skills in the care of patients with chronic pain. First, the psychiatrist is the examiner of mental life composed of thoughts, feelings, and actions. Patients with chronic pain suffer from depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions often not recognized or, when recognized, undertreated. The psychiatrist possesses the expertise in making these diagnoses and providing treatment for them. When a complete evaluation of the individual patient is not performed, the opportunity for making a diagnosis is lost, and the patient's suffering cannot be optimally treated. Second, as a result of caring for patients with mental disorders, the psychiatrist is the keeper of a specialized fund of knowledge. It is this specialized fund of knowledge about the conditions psychiatrists treat and not the fundamental methods they use in clinical practice that distinguishes psychiatrists from other medical specialists. Psychiatrists follow the same process of evaluating a patient as other physicians. Psychiatrists then offer the opportunity of innovative applications of their psychiatric knowledge, especially to the treatment-resistant chronic pain syndromes. This application helps to reintegrate psychiatry with the other specialties of medicine. These two skills define the role of psychiatrists in the treatment of patients, and subsequently how they can make a substantial contribution to the management of chronic pain. Chronic pain as a field of study has grown considerably. Many individuals now are attempting to define pain management as a separate medical specialty. Although it is impossible to review this entire literature, several advances are especially relevant to psychiatry. Psychiatrists need to understand that in addition to providing treatment for the psychiatric disorders accompanying chronic pain, they can apply psychological and pharmacologic methods to the primary treatment of chronic pain. The multidisciplinary, integrated treatment model of chronic pain is particularly suited to use by the psychiatrist who examines the entire person and not just a particular organ system. As a result, psychiatrists offer the opportunity to provide assistance to other health care providers who are managing patients with this difficult problem.",

The prevalence of post-stroke depression in patients with left anterior lesions could be due to the fact that the deficits resulting from this lesion are acutely present in the patient's awareness, provoking feelings of depression and anguish.

In recent years post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies. This disorder is defined as a reaction to an event that is accepted as traumatic by almost everyone, to an extraordinary life-threatening event, or to a disaster. Psychological reaction to events, which are not directly life threatening, is classified as adjustment disorder and is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice. As a result of experiencing such non-life threatening events, PTSD is claimed to be an adjustment disorder as well. Immigrants frequently report a depressive state in which physical symptoms are in the foreground accompanied by social withdrawal and diminished energy. Negative life events, which are not life threatening and are not experienced everyday, can impair mental health so that the above state may worsen and an immigrant may have a reduction in his performance at work. This state, which is accompanied by such symptoms as embitterment, feelings of injustice, repeated intrusive memories of critical events (injustice at work place, loss of a job, discrimination in a public office, etc.), phobic symptoms, and avoidance behavior towards the place or persons related to the event, might best be described by the term, posttraumatic embitterment disorder (PTED). This disorder, which was initially described in immigrants from East Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall, and which does not exactly match the diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder or PTSD, is presented in a case vignette and its differential diagnosis is discussed.",

Such patients are discharged from hospital without any apparent problems, but it is often the case that their families, and sometimes even they themselves, start to notice the emergence of new problems. They may exhibit affective changes, such as thinking that they are worthless, alone and without any future perspectives. When they are left without the help of specialists and/or family and friends, their problems gain even greater significance. PCS includes subjective physical complaints (i.e. headache, dizziness) and cognitive, emotional and behavioral changes. PCS influences all areas of the patient's life. Subjects who have sustained head injury often have problems with marital relationships, maintaining of independence, employment, leisure activities and other functions which are related to social adjustment. Various studies have attempted to predict the post-injury status of HI patients from information available, such as data on the severity of head injury, the duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) and the results of neuropsychological assessment. This kind of prediction is important in planning of rehabilitation services and thus improving the kind of help available to survivors of HI. Early prediction of post-injury psychological status may also help the patient and his family in coping with the difficulties related to the trauma. We know a great deal about head injury and its consequences, but many questions still need to be answered. Among these are issues such as: the role of neurobehavioral data in the prediction of outcome for HI patients, the identification of variables determining the extent of PCS and the search for reliable factors which may influence future employment or school status. The assessment of patients for invalidity and other social security benefits also requires a more rational approach, based on the data available.",

      "abstract": "Although hysteria is connected with the idea of the womb causing illness, including headache, pain was only one of many symptoms which have been classed under the term hysteria. Patterns of anxiety with bodily symptoms and depression contributed to ancient and early modern concepts of the diagnosis. Pain became moderately prominent as a hysterical symptom from about the 18th century onwards. Only in the 19th century, with advances in anatomy, physiology and clinical medicine did it become possible to prove that there was a limited group of symptoms which resulted from the patient's idea of illness. The explanation of hysterical symptoms has depended substantially upon Freudian theory which is now undergoing a serious challenge. Hysterical pains can only be diagnosed rarely, if at all, and different efforts to describe hysteria in patients with pain have only been partially successful. Attempts to classify pain as a behavioral disorder have also been substantially unsuccessful. This may be because the psychological causes of pain are not so common as previously thought. There is also increasing reason to believe that unexplained pains have a physiological basis.",

      "title": "Feeling emotional: the amygdala links emotional perception and experience",
      "abstract": "The term ‘emotion’ most commonly denotes a specific phenomenal state, such as the solemn weightiness associated with sadness or the lightness of being associated with joy. Human affective neuroscience has begun to pin down the elusive neuroanatomy of these most experientially prominent of mental experiences. One of the brain structures consistently associated with emotional functioning is the amygdaloid complex (Phan et al., 2002). Numerous neuroimaging studies have shown the amygdala varies with emotional experience in both healthy and mood disordered populations, pointing to its central role in emotional phenomenology. One difficulty with this apparent association is that emotion like cognition is not a single entity but is a multi-component process. Emotions reflect a constellation of diverse but correlated central neurocognitive and peripheral physiologic events. For example, witnessing a gruesome automobile accident is highly negatively valent, may involve specific appraisals related to fear or sadness, results in central and peripheral autonomic arousal, is attention grabbing thereby demanding to be the central focus of awareness, and in the following months and years may be associated with vivid reminiscences. In the safer confines of the lab or the bore of an MRI scanner, the amygdala has been associated to some extent with all of these putative functions. As such, amygdala activity may represent the generation of emotional experience itself, and/or it may reflect sundry aspects of emotional information processing correlated with emotional experience. In this issue, Feldman Barrett et al. demonstrate amygdala responses represent a critical nexus between the propensity for emotional experience and emotional interactions with perceptual encoding. The amygdala's role in feeling emotions may be tied to enhanced sensitivity toward emotional perception.\r\n\r\nFeldman Barrett et al. examined amygdala activation and its relation to emotional experience through the use of experience sampling. For 1 month three times daily, participants were probed via handheld PDA to indicate their present emotional state. One year following, participants were presented with backwardly masked fearful facial expressions during fMRI to index sensitivity of perceptual encoding of emotional events. Individual differences in propensity for negative affect, as indexed by experience sampling, were correlated with magnitude of amygdala response to presented fear faces. Moreover, in participants reporting increased anxiety during scanning, amygdala responses were associated with enhanced perceptual encoding of faces as indicated by increased fusiform activity. These results suggest that the amygdala may contribute to emotional experience by setting the appropriate preconditions for its expression: enhancing attention and associated perceptual encoding of emotional events, and thereby increasing their subjective salience.\r\n\r\nConsidering the mounting neuroimaging evidence consistent with an important role of the amygdala in generating affective experience there is surprisingly little direct evidence of disordered emotional experience following amygdala damage (Anderson and Phelps 2000; Anderson and Phelps 2002; Tranel et al., 2006), compared with evidence of the amygdala's central role in the emotional enhancement of mnemonic (Cahill et al., 1995) and perceptual processes (Anderson and Phelps 2001; Vuilleumier et al., 2004; Adolphs et al., 2005). For instance, patients with amygdala lesions provide retrospective reports of affective states (daily reflections) and traits (yearly reflections) of similar magnitude, frequency and underlying covariance structure to healthy controls (Anderson and Phelps, 2002). When asked to relive emotions, examinations of facial efference reveal that patients with bilateral amygdala damage display remarkably intact emotional expressions, including fear, despite pronounced impairments in the perception of these same signals (Anderson and Phelps, 2000). The results of such lesion studies, however, regard introspective emotional experiences that are associated with complex abstract factors and not directly tied to momentary environmental events. Many emotional experiences involve ruminations upon the past or future, thereby involving representations of threats and rewards in the absence of in the moment environmental stimulation. Such forms of emotional replay and forecasting may depend upon evolutionary more recent prefrontal neocortical representations rather than the amygdala alone. By contrast, the results of Feldman-Barrett et al. suggest that the amygdala's role is more related to momentary experiential states and enhanced attention and sensitivity toward encoding events surrounding these states.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala is neuroanatomically positioned to make a rapid and coarse appraisal of the state of the world, and via robust feedback projections, alter the perceptual process by enhancing the encoding of events of potential self importance. Neuroimaging studies have shown that emotionally arousing scenes vigorously engage early primary and secondary visual cortex (Bradley et al., 2003). Emotions thus bias attention to focus on events associated with subjective and physiologic arousal, shaping the ultimate contents of awareness (Anderson, 2005). Such arousal based modulatory effects depend on the integrity of the amygdala, with amygdala lesions eliminating the subjective biasing of perception toward the significant relative to the mundane, rendering the attentional landscape flat (Anderson and Phelps, 2001). Directly corroborating the results of Feldman-Barrett, enhanced extrastriate cortical responses to facial expressions of fear are correlated with magnitude of amygdala response (Morris et al., 1998), and these enhanced extrastriate responses are abolished following amygdala damage (Vuilleumier et al., 2004). The amygdala's role in evaluating the emotional value of fearful faces similarly depends on the ability to correctly attend to and encode their important features (Adolphs et al., 2005). If all the world's a stage, then the amygdala may be the emotional spotlight, shedding light on the most dramatic players of our life story.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala may thus represent embodied attention—the crucial link between central (mental) and peripheral (bodily) resources. Attention and awareness should be coupled with information of sufficient importance to result in autonomic activation and associated mobilization of peripheral metabolic resources, such as through altered respiration and heart rate. This redirecting of bodily physiologic resources may serve as the common primitive foundations of both attention and emotional experience. This common origin supports why emotional states are strongly correlated with how we think about and perceive the environment (Barrett and Niedenthal, 2004; Anderson, 2005; Rowe et al, 2007). More than a simple correlation, Feldman-Barrett et al.'s results suggest that emotional experience and individual differences therein may critically depend upon how we attend to the world (Barrett and Niedenthal, 2004; Anderson, 2005). Rather than being an ancillary consequence of, altered attention to emotional events may be part and parcel of emotional experience itself.",

According to recent clinical studies, the intensity of cognitive declines depends on a frequency and severity of seizures. However, presence of an epileptic focus does not always indicate an increase in cognitive impairments. An effect of a single convulsive seizure on cognitive functions at this stage is uncertain. According to some data, cognitive impairments after a single generalized seizures develop only in specific clinical syndromes, on the other hand, they are influenced by the emotional state of the subject. This problem remains relevant today. Further work is needed in this direction.В обзоре рассматриваются результаты исследований, посвященных когнитивным нарушениям (КН) после одного или нескольких судорожных приступов. Согласно полученным данным выраженность когнитивных изменений зависит от частоты и силы приступов. Но влияние однократного судорожного приступа на КФ точно не установлено: по данным одних исследователей, КН после однократного генерализованного судорожного приступа развиваются только при отдельных клинических синдромах, по другим - большое влияние оказывает эмоциональное состояние обследуемого. Подчеркивается, что наличие эпилептического очага не всегда говорит о нарастающем снижении когнитивных функций.

It is unclear whether the frequency of these disorders increases or decreases with age. Clinical expression of psychiatric disorders in old age may be different from that seen in younger age groups, with less and often milder symptoms. Concurrently, comorbidity between different psychiatric disorders is immense, as well as comorbidity with somatic disorders. Cognitive function is often decreased in people with depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis, but whether these disorders are risk factors for dementia is unclear. Psychiatric disorders in the elderly are often related to cerebral neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease, although psychosocial risk factors are also important. Psychiatric disorders, common among the elderly, have consequences that include social deprivation, poor quality of life, cognitive decline, disability, increased risk for somatic disorders, suicide, and increased nonsuicidal mortality.",

Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict.

      "abstract": "We previously hypothesized that depressive and manic states may be consecutive presentations of the same underlying neuronal plasticity, and that moderate impairments in neuronal plasticity cause depressive states while further impairment to neuronal plasticity causes manic states. Psychopathological or biological relationships between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have also been revealed. Therefore, in addition to depressive and manic states, psychosis may also be considered a manifestation resulting from additional impairments to neuronal plasticity. In the present manuscript, we hypothesize that moderate and more severe impairments to neuronal plasticity cause depressive and manic states, respectively, and that more serious impairments to neuronal plasticity cause psychosis. Many studies have suggested that impairments in neuronal plasticity contribute to schizophrenia and other mental disorders with psychotic features, and that the impairment of neuronal plasticity in schizophrenia is more severe than that in bipolar disorder. Therefore, we hypothesize more specifically that impairments in neuronal plasticity may be more severe in the order of the cases featuring psychosis, mania, and depression. This progression notably overlaps with the arrangement of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder in the DSM-5. Psychotic symptoms are thought to appear further towards the base of the psychopathological hierarchy than are manic or depressive symptoms. If impairments to neuronal plasticity contribute to this psychopathological hierarchy, as we contest that they do, our hypothesis may serve as a bridge between clinical psychopathology, diagnosis, and biological psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly apparent that although anxiety and depression are separate syndromes and can be identified as such, there is considerable overlap of clinical symptoms and pathophysiological processes. Data indicate that comorbid anxiety and depression is more common than either disorder alone. A large US study found that 58% of individuals with a history of depression also had an anxiety disorder, and a study by the World Health Organization showed that anxiety and depression were the most common coexisting psychological problems in primary care. Generalized anxiety disorder in particular is strongly comorbid with, and commonly precedes, major depression. The implications of comorbid anxiety and depression are significant, with increased social and psychological impairment, and poorer clinical outcomes and prognosis. Anxiety and depression coexist at much higher rates than would be expected by chance alone, suggesting that the two disorders are closely related and may have a common cause. Disturbances of serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission are both implicated in anxiety and depression, and new evidence suggests that these systems may provide a mechanistic link between the two disorders, with changes in one system being reflected in the other. Abnormal homeostasis of these two systems may result in anxiety and depression. New theories hypothesize a continuum of illness, with anxiety and depression possibly being different phenotypic expressions of a common neurobiological origin.

In most cases, low back pain has a good prognosis, but the condition is often the source of much frustration for clinicians, patients and employers. The family physician should be able to treat the patient's symptoms and address the psychosocial issues that frequently complicate recovery. Three decision points, based on the history and physical examination, allow the physician to determine the severity of illness and implement an appropriate treatment plan. These three points are as follows: Is it likely that systemic disease or bone pathology is the cause of pain? Has neurologic compromise occurred? Are social or psychologic stressors present that may prolong the clinical course?",

      "abstract": "Chez l'humain, les dépressions, dont la dépression post-partum, sont regroupées dans la catégorie « Trouble de l'humeur non spécifié ». Les causes de la dépression sont nombreuses et multifactorielles, d'ordre endocrinien, environnemental, social, affectif, psychologique. Quel qu'en soit l'effet déclencheur, la dépression s'accompagne toujours d'un dérèglement biochimique responsable de nombreux symptômes : anhédonie, anorexie ou hyperphagie, hyper- ou insomnie, perte de poids significative (< 5 %), agitation ou prostration, altération de la vie sociale, etc. L'élaboration d'une revue de littérature prépare la présentation d'un cas clinique de femelle orang-outan. L'étude de l'influence des facteurs biologiques et des agents stressants, tels que environnementaux, sociaux et affectifs, sur l'humeur et ses troubles, étaye l'analyse des résultats obtenus. Née en captivité en Allemagne, gestante primipare lors de son transfert en France en février 1996, Jane, jeune femelle orang-outan de 13 ans a commencé à envoyer des signes de détresse au cours du 3e mois de vie de son nourrisson (vomissement, anorexie, prostration). Au fur et à mesure des semaines son état s'aggravant, elle laissa son jeune au soin d'une femelle plus âgée et expérimentée qu'elle. Puisque les résultats médicaux affichaient des constantes normales, Sébastien Laurent, le directeur du parc commença à la masser, la coiffer, la forcer à manger et à la stimuler. Durant huit mois, chaque jour, il lui consacrait ce temps individualisé. Au fur et à mesure des soins, l'état de Jane s'améliora. Au neuvième mois, elle redevint entièrement autonome. Dans la dépression post-partum, le facteur stress jouerait un rôle fondamental dans le dérèglement de l'axe corticotrope, l'activation de la réponse inflammatoire et le syndrome de basse T3. La perte des repères familiers, l'absence de soutien, l'isolement familial ou social, la détresse affective sont des facteurs de stress indiscutables chez l'humain. Le cas clinique de Jane permet de confirmer que son arrivée dans ce nouveau zoo a pu provoquer un stress à l'origine de son désarroi. La massothérapie, l'attention individualisée, et le temps partagé avec un référent sécure et contenant, furent les outils psychothérapiques enrayant le processus dépressif. Les recherches médicales actuelles démontrent les effets positifs des massages au niveau de la diminution du taux de cortisol (hormone du stress) de 31 % et l'augmentation de sérotonine de 28 % et de dopamine de 31 % (neurotransmetteurs du bien-être), à l'issue de massothérapie.",

      "abstract": "Any systemic or neurological condition can cause sleep disruption. Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

No obstante, existen algunos vacíos de conocimiento en relación con esta problemática. Por ejemplo, aún no está del todo claro, por la poca evidencia disponible, cómo se relacionan el estrés académico y los hábitos de estudio inadecuados o la ansiedad y la somnolencia diurna en un ambiente educativo con estas características. Si estas asociaciones se demuestran, o se llegan a entender mejor, se podría concluir entonces que estudiar medicina (en particular) o una carrera universitaria con demandas académicas y emocionales similares (en general), tendría un nexo causal con los problemas de salud vinculados con la ansiedad, las alteraciones del sueño y los altos índices de estrés. Estos problemas incluyen, por ejemplo, las enfermedades mentales, como la depresión, o las alteraciones cardiovasculares, como la hipertensión arterial.

      "abstract": "Advances in neuroscience and pharmacology have led to improvements in the cognitive performance of people with neurological disease and other forms of cognitive decline. These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six clinical findings is a potential indicator of internal corroboration that trauma occurred, especially child sexual abuse. These six clinical findings include: the presence of a high-risk disorder or illness; posttraumatic stress disorder; age regression, flashbacks, abreactions, or other re-experiencing of the trauma; repetitions, repetition compulsions, or reenactments; characteristics of the memories themselves; and other patterns, dynamics, and connections. This framework can serve as a useful and clinical paradigm for all illnesses, including the addictive disorders.",

      "title": "Mania Associated with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition in the brain. A 29-year-old housewife with secondary mania related to multiple sclerosis is described. The case highlights the importance of considering organic causes in treating patients with mania, especially when there are unexplained neurological findings and cognitive dysfunction. The case also illustrates the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging for investigating organic causes of secondary mania and psychosis. Key words: Bipolar disorder, Case report, Diagnosis, Magnetic resonance imaging, Multiple sclerosis Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode according to DSM-IV requires a distinct period of persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting at least 4 days, with at least 3 associated symptoms, such as inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition. Very often, the florid psychopathology can obscure subtle neurological/physical signs and symptoms, and make the diagnosis of the underlying organic conditions difficult. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a particularly devastating disease of the central nervous system (CNS); a patient's presenting symptoms and the temporal evolution of the clinical findings may suggest the correct diagnosis. In relapsing-remitting MS--the type present in 80% of patients--symptoms and signs typically evolve over a period of several days, stabilise, and then often improve, spontaneously or with treatment, within weeks. Relapsing-remitting MS has a peak age of onset of 20 to 40 years and has a female predominance of approximately 2:1. This type of MS typically starts with sensory disturbances, unilateral optic neuritis, diplopia, limb weakness, clumsiness, gait apraxia, and neurogenic bladder and bowel symptoms. Twenty percent of affected patients have primary progressive MS, while others may develop persistent neurological signs after relapse and the disease may progress between relapses (secondary progressive MS). Prominent cortical signs (aphasia, apraxia, recurrent seizures, visual field loss, and early dementia) and extrapyramidal phenomena (chorea and rigidity) only rarely dominate the clinical picture. Eventually, cognitive impairment, depression, emotional lability, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, progressive quadriparesis, and other CNS manifestations become troublesome. The diagnosis is based on established clinical, and when necessary, laboratory criteria. The most widely used diagnostic criteria are Poser's criteria. (1) Very recently, a new criterion developed by McDonald has been found to enable earlier diagnosis in a group of patients with one demyelinating syndrome. (2) It may become widely used in the near future. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), findings of multifocal lesions of various ages, especially those involving the periventricular white matter, brain stem, cerebellum, and the spinal cord white matter, support the clinical impression. The presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI indicates current sites of presumed inflammatory demyelination (active lesions). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis often shows increased intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins of restricted specificity, oligoclonal bands may be present, or the synthesis of immunogobulin G (IgG) may be increased. Physiological evidence of subclinical dysfunction of optic nerves and spinal cord (changes in visual evoked responses and somatosensory evoked potentials) may further support the diagnosis. A case of a 29-year-old married woman with secondary hypomanic features associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) is presented, along with a review of the subject. …",

RESULTATER RESULTATER Eksekutiv svikt er en vanlig form for slagrelatert kognitiv dysfunksjon. Den sameksisterer ofte med emosjonell instabilitet og depresjon og er en viktig risikofaktor for tap av selvhjulpenhet og for redusert overlevelse. Diagnostikken er basert på anamnese og observasjon, supplert med kognitive tester. Eksekutiv svikt forekommer også hos personer uten distinkte kliniske hendelser, men med bildediagnostiske tegn på cerebral iskemi, og ved andre hjernesykdommer som Parkinsons sykdom og demenssykdommer. Anatomisk substrat for eksekutiv funksjon er i hovedsak prefrontal cortex og subkortikale baner, men slik svikt ses også ved lesjoner i andre hjerneområder. I behandlingen legges det vekt på kompenserende strategier og gjenvinning av tapt funksjon.

      "abstract": "Even though recognition of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by the medical community is not yet proportionate to its prevalence in the general population,1RLS was a syndrome reported as early as 1672 by Willis,2 and well defined clinically by Ekbom in 1945 and 1960.3,4 RLS may either occur as a primary disturbance, frequently familial and not associated with other neurological or systemic illnesses, or secondary to other pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, uremia, and pregnancy.5 Landmark but serendipitous discoveries, such as its association with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)6 and the discovery of the therapeutic effects of levodopa,7 were later followed by more systematic approaches aimed at the definition of the clinical diagnostic criteria,8,9 at measuring the degree of clinical severity,10 and of quality of life (QoL).11,12 Accordingly, the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS9 include the following: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

Manic-depressive psychosis is defined as a severe chronic mental disorder characterized by strikingly dissimilar phases which may follow each other with or without intervals of normality or may recur without the contrasting phase; the one phase includes acceleration of thought, hyperactivity, flight of ideas and distractibility, with resulting serious disturbances of judgment; the other phase is defined by poverty of ideation, hypo-activity and restriction of thought to a few grief-provoking ideas. The cyclothymic personality is viewed generally as an incomplete version of the psychosis, an abortive form of it or the manifestation of its anlage.

      "abstract": "Studies in hospices and nursing homes have shown that a number of different phenomena are associated with the mental states of the dying. In the days or weeks before death the dying person may have premonitions, often unrecognised, of their impending death, or visions of dead relatives who they say have visited them. Relatives who may be spatially distant from but emotionally close to the dying person may experience an inexplicable awareness of them at the time of their death. Other phenomena reported at the time of death are clocks stopping, mechanical malfunctions, strange animal behaviour and shapes seen leaving the body or light seen surrounding it. Although these phenomena are well recognised by both carers and relatives, they are seldom discussed because they are difficult to explain in terms of any recognised medical model. A possible alternative hypothesis involves non-local effects which would require a quantum mechanical explanation. This is supported by parapsychological findings which are not always accepted by mainstream science. The hypothesis suggests that as death approaches consciousness becomes loosened from the brain-mind structure and this is the prime mover for the non-local effects that are noticed at this time.",

La ceguera, diplopia o paralisis de la mirada son los signos neuroftalmologicos mas frecuentes en el trastorno conversivo. Describimos el caso de un nino con ptosis como manifestacion de un trastorno conversivo. Metodo y resultados: Varon de 9 anos en estudio por ptosis unilateral izquierda de inicio brusco, sin antecedentes medicos relevantes. En la exploracion se aprecia ptosis de ceja y palpebral izquierda, sin alteraciones de la motilidad ocular intrinseca ni extrinseca. Dado que la exploracion no se justifica por patologia de ningun par craneal, se sospecha ptosis miogenica y se solicita estudio. Las pruebas complementarias, tales como analitica autoinmune, test de estimulacion repetitiva, etc. fueron negativas. Tras descartar patologia organica y conocer situacion emocional inestable por separacion de sus padres, es valorado por el servicio de psiquiatria con diagnostico de trastorno conversivo. Conclusion: La ptosis es una rara manifestacion del trastorno conversivo, y aun mas en la infancia. Solo hemos encontrado dos casos descritos en la literatura. Es importante descartar patologia organica, diferenciar esta patologia de la simulacion y conocerla para incluirla en el diagnostico diferencial de la ptosis. EnglishPurpose: Conversion disorder is defined by DSM-IV as a deficit of sensory or motor function that cannot be explained by a medical condition and where psychological factors are judged to be associated with the deficit because symptoms are preceded by conflicts or other stressors. Blindness, diplopia or paralysis of the gaze are the most frequent neurophthalmological signs in the conversion disorder. We describe the case of a child with ptosis as a manifestation of a conversion disorder. Method and results: A 9-year-old male with abrupt left unilateral ptosis, without relevant medical history. On exploration, present left eyebrow and palpebral ptosis, without intrinsic or extrinsic ocular motility alterations. Since the examination is not justified by pathology of any cranial nerve pair, myogenic ptosis is suspected and study. Complementary tests were negative (autoimmune analytics, repetitive stimulation test, etc.). After ruling out organic pathology and knowing unstable emotional situation by separation from their parents, it is valued by the psychiatry service with a diagnosis of conversion disorder. Conclusion: Ptosis is a rare manifestation of the conversion disorder, and even more so in childhood. We have only found two cases in the literature. It is important to rule out organic pathology, differentiate this pathology from the simulation and know it to include in the differential diagnosis of ptosis.",

Mania, delusions, hallucinations, personality alterations, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and changes in sexual behavior are less common but have also been described in post-stroke patients.

Symptoms of increased arousal can occur as well as depression and anxiety. PTSD causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The general practitioner is uniquely placed to identify PTSD and can have a key role in treatment. Cognitive behavioural treatment is a central therapeutic approach and can be carried out in general practice. The issues are to counteract the physiological components, expose the patient to the feared situation and help the patient to relearn that the stimuli are not necessarily associated with danger or threat.

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures that are caused by abnormal and excessive cerebral neuronal discharges. The clinical symptoms are paroxysmal, and may include impaired consciousness and/or motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic events. Diagnosis of epilepsy is not always straightforward and clear-cut. A seizure is only a symptom that indicates neuronal dysfunction. Other diseases can cause paroxysmal events, which look very much like a seizure but in fact are nonepileptic. Such nonepileptic events include syncope, acute symptomatic seizures, and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. To identify epileptic seizures and to classify the type of epilepsy, clinical, electroencephalographic (EEG), and/or neuroimaging findings are the fundamentals. Knowledge of the different types of seizures is essential to guide the physician in obtaining the history which leads to the diagnosis of seizure and epilepsy. In real situations, however, it is rare for physicians to actually witness the event of seizure. This lecture provides valuable opportunity to experience \"real life\" clinical diagnosis of epileptic seizures by showing the video of patient under seizure and EEG data. Representative visual examples of symptoms together with the detailed medical knowledge will greatly enhance the capability of diagnosis, the effectiveness of treatment, and help develop clinical strategies.",

It is thought that a certain degree of cognitive decline occurs due to biological changes in the aging human brain, but evidence suggests that more abrupt and perceptible decline is often associated with an underlying death process or disease pathology. Decline is often gradual and relatively imperceptible for a period of several years, then increases dramatically in closer proximity to death. Future investigations are necessary to characterize disease‐specific decline trajectories and understand how specific areas of cognition (i.e., memory, vocabulary) are affected by terminal decline.",

The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

In the first instance, intemperance may appear as a hurtful habit of the individual favouring the development of the spasmodic neurosis, or again, as a constitutional tendency entailed by parent on offspring with similar dreadful consequences. In the second instance, the moral perversion ordinarily wrought by their disease on the character and conduct of several epileptics, drives them to vicious indulgence in drinking, which aggravates and changes the original character of their fits. The majority of writers have not distinguished in estimating the relationship of intemperance to epilepsy, or insanity, the number of cases immediately ascribable to vice from those in which the uncontrollable passion, or craving for drink, is, as it also happens with masturbation, merely the sign of the outbreak of an inherited predisposition to insanity, or epilepsy, or of the early stages in the evolution of either of these maladies as consequence of accidental causes. Nor has the influence which traumatic injuries to the head, syphilis, or other derangements possibly coincident with the abuse of alcoholics, by themselves exert, been taken into proper account in calculating the part of the latter in the spread, on a wide and increasing scale, of mental and nervous affections. Although this discrimination is by no means always practicable, we may yet arrive at it by diligent inquiry and with a material change in the results, as evinced by the cases we pass on to analyse.",

      "abstract": "Alcoholic excess is associated with epilepsy in two different ways, as cause or as an effect of it. In the first instance, intemperance may appear as a hurtful habit of the individual favouring the development of the spasmodic neurosis, or again, as a constitutional tendency entailed by parent on offspring with similar dreadful consequences. In the second instance, the moral perversion ordinarily wrought by their disease on the character and conduct of several epileptics, drives them to vicious indulgence in drinking, which aggravates and changes the original character of their fits. The majority of writers have not distinguished in estimating the relationship of intemperance to epilepsy, or insanity, the number of cases immediately ascribable to vice from those in which the uncontrollable passion, or craving for drink, is, as it also happens with masturbation, merely the sign of the outbreak of an inherited predisposition to insanity, or epilepsy, or of the early stages in the evolution of either of these maladies as consequence of accidental causes. Nor has the influence which traumatic injuries to the head, syphilis, or other derangements possibly coincident with the abuse of alcoholics, by themselves exert, been taken into proper account in calculating the part of the latter in the spread, on a wide and increasing scale, of mental and nervous affections. Although this discrimination is by no means always practicable, we may yet arrive at it by diligent inquiry and with a material change in the results, as evinced by the cases we pass on to analyse.",

      "abstract": "'Depressed' literally means pushed out of a place where one has felt safe, and so its first association applies to birth as the primary experience of losing a place inside which one has been contained. Being sad or having marked oscillations of mood during adolescence is a physiological fact. However, it is a disturbing statistic that in the past thirty years the number of suicides in this age group has tripled, and that suicide is the second highest cause of death during adolescence in Italy. The symptoms of adolescent depression can be the same as those of adults: insomnia, restlessness, withdrawal. Depression in children is not infrequent and its symptoms are manifested more in the body than in a variation in quality of mood. Restlessness, insomnia, lack of engagement in school, and bulimia can be some of the commonest symptomatic manifestations of infantile depression.",

      "abstract": "Dissociative disorders involve a division of an organism-environment or ecological system into subsystems. Each subsystem or dissociative agent brings forth his or her own, however rudimentary, experience and idea of self, world, and self as a part of this world. The disorders manifest in dissociative symptoms. Some are psychoform (e.g., one dissociative agent hearing another dissociative agent speak), others are somatoform, or sensory and motor (e.g., being analgesic while another dissociative agent is in pain). Somatoform and psychoform dissociative symptoms often occur together. Somatoform dissociative symptoms are characteristic of dissociative disorders and proportional to their complexity. The disorders include ICD-10's Dissociative Disorders of Movement and Sensation, inadequately renamed in ICD-11 Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder. Sensory and motor dissociative disorders are categorized in DSM-5 as Conversion Disorder. This is confusing, because the symptoms involve dissociation, not conversion of something mental into something physical. PTSD, which can be seen as a simple dissociative disorder, is associated with marked somatoform dissociation. Adverse events, particularly chronic interpersonal abuse and neglect, and the motivational conflicts this adversity typically implies, constitute an important causal factor of somatoform dissociation.",

In no branch of medicine is a good history more important than in neurology. It makes all the difference in the diagnosis of a difficult case in which the physical signs may not be in doubt. Time spent on it is well worth while. The poor witness can be helped by leading questions. After taking the detailed history it should be possible to list the probable site or sites of the nervous system affected, from muscle to cerebral cortex. Also, from the course of development of the symptoms (for example, whether episodic or progressive), it should be possible to suggest the likely pathological diagnosis. For example, vascular lesions tend to cause sudden or episodic symptoms; cerebral tumours more often cause slowly progressive symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is an impossible concept. Under this heading, a number of psychoses is being grouped which have the common characteristic that the patient is, as a rule, but by no means always, fully conscious. In all other respects, no other points agree, neither in respect of symptoms, nor in respect of etiology or prognosis. Hence, there are hardly any reasons to reduce these disease patterns to a common denominator, either as \"schizophrenia\" or as a \"group of schizophrenic psychoses\". Rather, it seems more probable that schizophrenic psychoses are individual disease patterns, instead of being variations of a basic type. What is principally needed at this stage, is a fair amount of empirical research to catalog the concept of schizophrenia. Such a catalog would have to be based on exactly defined and described syndromes to enable further study whether there are any other points besides these symptoms which characterize the syndrome in question, such as etiology, pathogenetic factors, course, or response treatment. The more characteristics are found, the greater the chance that the disease pattern under investigation is really a unit by itself. In the course of these studies, and in order to avoid terminological confusion, it is advisable to use, for the time being, the term \"schizophrenic psychoses\", under the condition that in each concrete case this term must be supplemented by a careful typification of the symptomatology, of the etiologic factors, and of the course of the disease.",

Three interrelated components of vital depersonalization were distinguished. The main depersonalization component proper was manifested by the experience of estrangement and unreality of the feeling of existence (\"self\"). The second, affective one, was marked by vital fear and anxiety. The third one involved common sense disorders and was characterized by vital bodily sensations. Vital depersonalization had all the principal signs of depersonalization. However, it differed from the allo-, somato- and autotypes of depersonalization in disorders of the vital level: similarity to physical sensations, pain and vagueness. Vital depersonalization may be viewed as pathology of the first level of selfawareness--selfsence of awareness of vital ego or of body perception.",

In clinical practice, it is very difficult to distinguish BD from MDD as the BD pa-tients in depressive episode stage may manifest the same symptoms as those of MDD patients. There is increasing research evidence, however, showing the differences between MDD and BD in multiple aspects, such as clinical characteristics and pathogenesis. Here, we summarized the research progress on the heterogeneity of BD and MDD by reviewing Chinese and English literature published in recent years. The main content includes the differences between the both disorders in clinical manifestations, psychological characteristics, genetic factors, neuropathology, and neurochemical metabolism. These data would be useful for the early identification of BD from MDD.",

In some cases, the content of the psychosis could be partly traced to earlier factors in the patient's lives. The clouded states were compared to alcoholic pathological intoxication. Three had chronic psychoses resembling schizophrenia. One other was considerably deteriorated. The rest were unclassified. The neuropathological processes underlying these conditions are unknown.

They occur due to a complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors and are some of the most common conditions encountered in general clinical practice as well as the specialist gastroenterological clinic. The top-down regulation of visceral sensations plays an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease, i.e., the central processing of emotions and stressors altering the sensory and motor components of the gut, which increases hypersensitivity and therefore symptom severity. In addition, the core personality traits of the individual play their part in the way symptoms are perceived, further providing proof for the long-prevailing belief that the gut and emotions are linked, the so-called \"gut feeling.\" The current diagnostic criteria for FGIDs are entirely based on subjective symptoms, challenging in itself due to the varied presentations, and further complicated by the current unavailability of objective laboratory tests which could confirm its presence in the symptomatic individual. The various treatment modalities include psychotherapies ranging from cognitive behavioral therapy to mindfulness, along with appropriate pharmacotherapy to treat physical and psychiatric comorbidities. Addressing all these underlying causes, in addition to weighing in the genetic makeup of the individual, is necessary for delineating accurate prognosis, reducing attending health-care costs, and improving overall outcome of the individual.",

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

Optimal management of the symptomatic and somatizing patient thus entails obtaining psychological information about emotional precipitants, relevant childhood experiences, psychiatric disorders, and the personal meaning of the symptom; searching for the somatizing personality themes of masochism and guilt, hostility, and dependence; understanding the patient's goals in obtaining medical care, such as information and explanation, psychological counseling, or social and administrative intervention; and assessing situational stress, secondary gain, and ethnic and cultural forces that foster the amplification of physical symptoms.",

After being involved in such an event, many people have trouble sleeping, have nightmares or daytime memories of the event, and feel emotionally numb and cut off from others. For most people, these symptoms stop within a month after the stressful event. When these symptoms continue for months or years, it is called post-traumatic stress disorder.",

      "title": "Concussion and mild head injury",
      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "abstract": "Introduccion : El dolor agudo constituye una compleja constelacion de experiencias sensoriales y emocionales, relacionadas con respuestas autonomas producidas por dano a estructuras somaticas o viscerales. Las vias del dolor transmiten la informacion nociceptiva a traves del sistema nervioso periferico y central y estan plenamente integradas con el sistema motor y simpatico a nivel medular y de los centros nerviosos superiores y dan lugar a actividad motora refleja, hiperactividad simpatica y respuestas afectivas y conductuales. Objetivo : Definir los mecanismos fisiopatologicos que se desencadenan en presencia de dolor agudo y las alteraciones que consecuentemente generan en diferentes organos y sistemas. Desarrollo : Las respuestas generadas a nivel segmentario, suprasegmentario y cortical dan lugar a alteraciones fisiopatologicas en el sistema cardiovascular, respiratorio y en otros organos y sistemas. Estas alteraciones pueden modificar negativamente el curso de la lesion o enfermedad que origino el dolor y provocar graves trastornos hemodinamicos que pueden llevar a la muerte del paciente. Conclusiones : Aunque el dolor agudo tiene una funcion biologica protectora, cuando es persistente o no mitigado provoca alteraciones fisiopatologicas en los diferentes organos y sistemas que son nocivas para el paciente. Pese al rapido progreso alcanzado en el conocimiento de su fisiopatologia y el desarrollo de novedosas y efectivas tecnicas para su tratamiento, la conducta terapeutica del paciente con dolor agudo es inadecuada.",

Causal explanations for these range from psychopathology of mental illness, drugs such as hallucinogens, neurological disorders including temporal lobe epilepsy, and genuine mystical or spiritual awakening. There is a common core of phenomena in such experiences, as described both in historical accounts and recent research, but also evidence of cultural specificity. This article is a personal account of such an experience, which occurred in a postanesthetic state. A striking feature of the experience was noesis: a sense of revelation and complete understanding. I argue that while there must be a neural basis to these phenomena, it is difficult to reduce the subjective meaning of the experience purely to a brain dysfunction. Reconciling mechanism and meaning of such experiences remains a challenge for both neuroscience and philosophy.",

From a biological viewpoint, chronic fear and activation of glucocorticoids are metabolically costly. The physiological effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may elicit posttraumatic stress disorder, the physiological characteristics of which may be in the opposite direction to those of TBI. Somatic injury occurring in the concussive accident may be the most important consideration affecting status and outcome. Chronic stress impairs the process of wound healing, attributable to proinflammatory. Stress reduces the immune response, and reduces the proliferation and activity of various types of cells. Prolonged somatic activity related to injury, stress, pain; stress reactions to chronic pain and impairment; and unhappiness all result in neuroendocrine imbalances. Physiological dysfunctions contribute to neurobehavioral dysfunctioning that can be misattributed to cerebral injury, faking or secondary gain, if the practitioner does not consider the effects of an injury.",

Disorders of speech movements may be manifest as the only problem in communication or they may occur with impairments in language function. For this reason, and as a matter of scientific and clinical convenience, speech and language typically are considered to be products of distinct nervous system operations. On the one hand, speech can be viewed as the process whereby controlled movements are transformed into sound, thus providing the medium through which semantically significant messages are transmitted. By contrast, language is an organized system of consistent abstract symbols that provides the meaning-based format for speech.",

Transformational crisis may even occur within the context of a psychiatric hospitalization. Such STEs are at odds with the medical model of Western psychiatry that emphasizes pathology. Yet a coherent approach yields no absolute differentiation between spiritual emergence and what health professionals diagnose as mental illness. A historical perspective begins with the presumed differentiation between authentic spiritual experience and psychiatric illness. A more functional approach to spiritual emergency takes into account the perspective of experiencers, their communication and meta-communication skills, and the integration process itself. One case from the popular literature and two cases from the author's psychotherapy practice are presented to demonstrate that the list of causative experiences for STEs can include what is diagnosable as a psychiatric condition, specifically, bipolar disorder.",

The major difficulties in the diagnostic assessment of primary and non‐primary dystonia derive from its confusion with other movement disorders or with a psychogenic disorder. The clinical heterogeneity of dystonia and some examples of misdiagnosis are reviewed here. The movement disorders that can be most commonly taken for dystonia are tremor, Parkinson’s disease, myoclonus, chorea, and tics.
