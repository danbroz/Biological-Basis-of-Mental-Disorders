      "abstract": "Psychogenic amnesia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by sudden loss of memory in the absence of organic lesion or disease. The disorder most frequently occurs in association with a severe stressor, such as a natural disaster or military conflict. To facilitate effective treatment and an accurate prognosis, psychogenic amnesia must be differentiated from amnesia of structural or pharmacologic origin. Treatment may involve supportive psychotherapy, behavioral modification or pharmacotherapy. Prognosis for complete recovery is generally good.",

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human consciousness, the awareness of oneself and one’s environment, is an artificial construction. In a normal state of consciousness, the brain seamlessly integrates sensory perceptions, emotional states, current thoughts, and past memories. The essential feature of the various dissociative disorders is that these elements have become disrupted, dissociated, from each other. The distinctions between the different types of dissociative disorders are based on which particular aspect of subjective experience has become dissociated from the others. Dissociative amnesia is characterized by dissociation of memory. The affected individual demonstrates an inability to recall important biographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. The memory deficit is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forget-fulness. Dissociative fugue is characterized by an even greater dissociation of memory, such that the individual dissociates not only key historical information but also his own sense of identity. Affected individuals may engage in sudden, unexpected travel away from their homes or customary places of work, accompanied by an inability to recall their past, confusion about their personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity.",

      "title": "Amnesia",
      "abstract": "Amnesia refers to difficulty in learning new information or in remembering the past. These impairments can have a functional origin, but more commonly they result from neurological injury or disease. Functional amnesia is a psychiatric disorder. The amnesia in this case is presumed to result from conflict and repression, and its presentation varies from individual to individual. Typically, a patient is admitted to the hospital in a confused or frightened state. Memory for the past has been lost, especially personal, autobiographical memory. Often, the patient cannot produce his or her own name. Yet, the ability to learn new material is almost always intact. After the disorder clears, usually within a week, the lost memories return except for the events of the day or two just prior to hospital admission. Rarely, the disorder lasts longer, and sizable pieces of the past remain unavailable.",

Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation. Agrypnia excitata is the term that aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "The amnesia phenomenon in patients with dissociative disorders currently represents one of the most intriguing areas in the study of psychiatric disorders and memory processes. Dissociative amnesia intersects with the study of normal and traumatic memory, childhood sexual abuse, and suggestibility. Dissociative amnesia is rarely the single symptom; in the majority of cases the amnesia symptom is embedded in, and co-occurs with, other dissociative phenomena. Hypnosis may well be used to access the memory that otherwise is unavailable to consciousness. Psychotherapy can include art therapy, dance and movement therapy, and journaling and creative writing therapies. In diagnosing dissociative amnesia it is most important to differentiate dissociative from non-dissociative amnesia. Assessment should focus on excluding organic causes, substance abuse, head trauma, or epilepsy. Most important information assessing dissociative amnesia is derived from the patient's history for there is a strong relation to psychological trauma.",

The peripheral and central components of the autonomic nervous system are frequently affected by diseases, conditions, or toxins. Autonomic disorders are described as (1) primary—without defined cause, including multiple system atrophy and acute/subacute dysautonomias; or (2) secondary—with specific defects or as a consequence of other conditions, including diabetes mellitus, Riley–Day syndrome, amyloid neuropathy, dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency, spinal cord injury, and many drugs.",

It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "title": "Stress and cognition",
      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

Concussion—sometimes called mild traumatic brain injury—is different from other forms of head injury. Concussions usually involve some temporary disruption of thinking skills or brief alteration of awareness, among other symptoms. Concussion has many different acute symptoms, and these same symptoms occur in a variety of health conditions and situations, which can sometimes make concussions difficult to detect. Symptoms may affect physical, cognitive, or emotional functioning as well as sleep.",

      "title": "Retrograde Amnesia – A Question of Disturbed Calcium Levels?",
      "abstract": "Retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events or information. The successful acquisition and memory of information is required before retrograde amnesia may occur. Often, the trigger for retrograde amnesia is a traumatic event. Loss of memories may be caused in two ways: either by loss/erasure of the memory itself or by the inability to access the memory, which is still present. In general, memories and learning are associated with a positive connotation although the extinction of unpleasant experiences and memories of traumatic events may be highly welcome. In contrast to the many experimental models addressing learning deficits caused by anterograde amnesia, the incapability to acquire new information, retrograde amnesia could so far only be investigated sporadically in human patients and in a limited number of model systems. Apart from models and diseases in which neurodegeneration or dementia like Alzheimer’s disease result in loss of memory, retrograde amnesia can be elicited by various drugs of which alcohol is the most prominent one and exemplifies the non-specific effects and the variable duration. External or internal impacts like traumatic brain injury, stroke, or electroconvulsive treatments may similarly result in variable degrees of retrograde amnesia. In this review, I will discuss a new genetic approach to induce retrograde amnesia in a mouse model and raise the hypothesis that retrograde amnesia is caused by altered intracellular calcium homeostasis. Recently, we observed that neuronal loss of neuroplastin resulted in retrograde amnesia specifically for associative memories. Neuroplastin is tightly linked to the expression of the main Ca 2+ extruding pumps, the plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs). Therefore, neuronal loss of neuroplastin may block the retrieval and storage of associative memories by interference with Ca 2+ signaling cascades. The possibility to elicit retrograde amnesia in a controlled manner allows to investigate the underlying mechanisms and may provide a deeper understanding of the molecular and circuit processes of memory.",

But clinical syndromes and personality disorders are now seen as separate entities; therefore, psychogenic trance is part of the so-called 'dissociative disorders'. Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

MemoryDefects of memory are either in the registration of new experience (antegrade) or the recall of past experience (retrograde).In gross dementia the patient may lose the ability to repeat a series of numbers he has just heard.This immediate type of defect is also seen in dysphasia, or whenever attention or concentration is dis- tracted-as in depression or acute confusional states.Short term memory deficit is tested by inviting the recall of a few numbers and two or three names after five minutes of other conversation.The limbic system, including the mamillary bodies and hippocampus, must be intact for new experience to be registered and recent events recollected.In Korsakow's amnesia, where the main damage is in the mamillary bodies, antegrade amnesia-learning ability-is permanently damaged and several years ofexperience are lost.After head injury an antegrade defect is noted but this is temporary.The retrograde amnesia shrinks until minutes or seconds before the accident.Deep memory, including childhood events, can be retained and recalled when limbic structures no longer function.The long term memory is tested by asking for details of the patient and his family and about important people or events.Moments of great personal pleasure or poignancy can be recalled most clearly.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a serious mental illness that can be debilitating. It can interfere with daily activities and cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

      "abstract": "The sense of personal identity is an element of the Jasperian definition of self-conscience. Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

It refers to a change in cognitive function that is severe enough to compromise an individual's daily function. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) defines dementia as an acquired impairment of cognitive function that includes a decline in memory beyond what would be expected for age and at least one other cognitive function, such as attention, visuospatial skills or language, or a decline in executive functioning such as planning, organization, sequencing, or abstracting. The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia. Dementia can further be defined by a possible, probable, or definite etiologic diagnosis. A degenerative dementia implies disease progression over time.",

L'alteration des fonctions cognitives est souvent associee a une intensite symptomatique plus elevee. Certaines des anomalies cognitives persistent au-dela de l'episode depressif, representant des caracteristiques fondamentales de type trait. Il est important d'evaluer les fonctions cognitives des patients apres le retour a l'equilibre de l'humeur pour permettre de mieux caracteriser l'evolution et la nature des symptomes non affectifs associes au trouble depressif. La performance en memoire episodique des sujets âges deprimes a ete retrouvee proche de celle de temoins apparies en âge, la plainte en memoire des patients depend de l'intensite de leur depression. Un deficit des fonctions d'attention ou de memoire immediate est susceptible d'interferer avec la plupart des actions et comportements de la vie de tous les jours.

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

As the experts 7 certified specialists (psychiatrists, psychologists and others) were involved.

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "The Somatoform Disorders class was created for clinical utility and not on the basis of an assumed common etiology or mechanism. The excessive thoughts, feeling or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns are demonstrated through one of three possible avenues. Considering the major anxiety disorders, the somatic symptoms in Panic Disorder tend to appear initially in discrete episodes. The occurrence of a medical illness does not eliminate the possibility of Illness Anxiety Disorder. The diagnosis can still be applied if the health-related anxiety and the concerns about the illness are significantly out of proportion. Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s). Pain disorder associated with a general medical condition was not considered to be a mental disorder, because the requirement was not met that psychological factors play an important role.",

      "abstract": "Transient global amnesia is a momentary neurological accident frequently encountered in subjects over 50 years of age. Its diagnosis is purely clinical and rests on the sudden occurrence of retention amnesia associated with retrograde amnesia without disturbances in speech or other neurological deficits. The amnesia totally regresses within less than 24 hours. Paraclinical examinations add nothing to the diagnosis. The cause of transient global amnesia is unknown, and the various hypotheses that have been put forward (e.g. epilepsy, transient ischaemia or migraine) have not been confirmed by clinical and epidemiological studies. Despite a low, but real risk of recurrence, the prognosis is perfectly benign, and there is no need for curative or preventive treatment.",

      "abstract": "For the clinician, insomnia is a symptom which is difficult to understand as it is a predominantly subjective variable: in clinical practice, it is the patient's complaint which guides the doctor in his diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder.

Insomnia can be transient, short-term, or chronic in its presentation. Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related personal discomfort. Chronic insomnia can be caused by neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders starting or persisting during sleep that hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity. Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation. Agrypnia excitata (AE) is the term which aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome, whose pathogenetic mechanism consists in an intralimbic disconnection releasing the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation from corticolimbic control.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

Based on the underlying mechanisms, psychogenic (or functional) neurologic diseases are classified into three categories: conversion disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering. Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs. Four of the most common epilepsies are: (1) grand mal — manifested by major convulsions, usually a sequence of tonic spasm of all body musculature followed by synchronous clonic jerking and prolonged post-seizure depression of all central functions; (2) petit mal — characterized by brief attacks of loss of consciousness usually accompanied by some clonic motor activity, sometimes with no motor activity, and sometimes with complete relaxation of all musculature; (3) psychomotor epilepsy — characterized by attacks of confused behavior with a wide variety of clinical manifestations; (4) focal cortical epilepsy in which there may be motor abnormalities including convulsions of single limbs or muscle groups or specific and localized sensory disturbances depending on the particular area of cortex producing the abnormal electrical activity.",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

Need to improve recognition, reduce sub-optimal care and improve long-term outcomes. There is variation in management of care across healthcare settings. Characteristics of a Manic Episode: A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood. During the period of mood disturbance, at least three of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable) and have been persistent to a significant degree.1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 2. Decreased need for sleep. 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 5. Distractability, i.e. attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli. 6. Increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation. 7. Excessive involvement in pleasurable activities which have a high potential for painful consequences, e.g. unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments. Mood disturbance sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in occupational functioning or in usual social activities or relations with others, or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others. At no time during the disturbance have there been delusions or hallucinations for as long as two weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms. Not superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophrenic form disorder, or delusional disorder or psychotic disorder. The disturbance is not due to the physiologic effects of a substance or general medical disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The study of individuals with damaged memory shows a lot about how a healthy memory works. ‘Memory impairment’ considers the condition of memory loss (amnesia) where memory does not work effectively due to brain injury. How can other clinical conditions and mental states, besides brain damage, influence memory? Different subtypes of amnesia have different characteristics. The study of amnesia is important as a way of discriminating between memory processes and in linking deficits in remembering with specific neurological structures that are damaged. Not all memory disorders arise from organic injury or illness. ‘Psychogenic amnesia’ is usually caused by a functional impairment of memory with no tangible evidence of neurological brain injury.",

      "title": "Stress and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Neonatal brain injuries represent a group of common yet heterogeneous disorders, which result in long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. A significant proportion is related to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, either diffuse or focal (e.g., stroke). Neonatal brain injury is recognized clinically by a characteristic encephalopathy that evolves over days in the newborn period. This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births. More than 95% of infants with neonatal stroke survive to adulthood, and many have some form of motor or cognitive disability.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

Many cognitive functions may be concerned and can be explained by fronto-striatal brain circuits and hippocampus dysfunctions partly through abnormalities related to cerebrovascular diseases. It seems important to distinguish between early and late onset depression whose cognitive characterisation and etiopathogenia differ in some aspects. Cognitive impairment may represent markers of depression but it is still unclear whether one should consider potential biomarkers of disease state or trait or risk factor. These disorders may precede depression and persist despite symptomatic remission. Moreover, the interest of specifying these disorders is multiple because they can have pejorative consequences such as the modification of emotional content, promote suicidal act, limit the effectiveness of psychotherapy, be a risk factor for poor response to antidepressants. or be a potential risk factor for progression to a minor or major neurocognitive disorder, especially Alzheimer's disease.",

These disorders are usually associated with other cognitive and neurological deficits, and are labelled as neuropsychiatric when the whole clinical picture is consistent with the specific dysfunction of a neural system or brain region. Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits). However, post-stroke depression and anxiety, which have a more variable clinical presentation and might be assimilated, for several aspects, to post-traumatic or adaptive disorders, are disorders less characterized in their neural correlates.",

      "abstract": "Memory is a reconstructive process classified as explicit and implicit memory by level of awareness. Explicit memory is a conscious recollection of either episodic or semantic memory. Episodic memory is from personal experience and is context-specific while semantic memory refers to general knowledge. Implicit memory is from priming, procedure memory or skills. On-line message held by the brain is the working memory. Prospective memory is about something to be done in the future. Over-reliance on gist memory brings in false memory. The stirring of emotion has effect on encoding and consolidation. Explicit memory depends on medial temporal and prefrontal lobes. Priming impinges directly on cerebral cortex. Procedure memory or motor skills are closely related to basal ganglia. Cerebellum plays an important role in classical conditioning and complex motor learning. Age effect on memory is mainly from decreased speed and capacity of the central executive function. Age-associated memory impairment could be normal aging while mild cognitive impairment could be preclinical dementia. Alzheimer's disease starts with episodic memory, frontotemporal dementia defects semantic memory and Lewy's body dementia impairs working memory.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

      "abstract": "Mild head injury is a quiet disorder. It is common, typically bloodless and without call for significant medical intervention. It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

Puede generar déficit notables en funciones psicológicas importantes como la ejecutiva, la atención o la memoria y evolucionar hasta un cuadro de pseudodemencia susceptible de mejorar con tratamiento antidepresivo.Objetivo: describir el funcionamiento de la memoria explícita en el trastorno depresivo mayor. Materiales y métodos: se hizo una búsqueda en la base de datos PUBMED con las palabras clave “major depression” (depresión mayor), “explicit memory” (memoria explícita) y “recollection memory” (memoria de recolección); se tomaron los artículos publicados después del año 2000; adicionalmente se incluyó bibliografía científica relevante para el cumplimiento del objetivo. Desarrollo: en la neuroanatomía del trastorno depresivo mayor se encuentran implicadas redes fronto-subcorticales (como las áreas prefrontales, tálamo, ganglios basales, hipocampo, entre otras). Estas estructuras pueden presentar atrofias que explicarían la persistencia o cronicidad de algunos de los síntomas cognitivos de la depresión. Las alteraciones en la memoria explícita, declarativa o de recolección, son de particular importancia por ser las más frecuentemente encontradas en sujetos con uno o más episodios depresivos mayores, y la estructura cerebral que se ha correlacionado más directamente con alteraciones en el almacenamiento de la memoria explícita es el hipocampo. Se ha observado actividad continua de neurogénesis en el hipocampo de animales adultos, la cual es especialmente susceptible cuando hay exposición prolongada a situaciones de estrés grave. Esto se evidencia en estudios que han encontrado reducido su volumen en sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor, en comparación con individuos sanos. De todas maneras, aunque no se encuentre una reducción marcada del volumen, se sugiere que hay una alteración de su funcionamiento.Conclusiones: la memoria explícita es un proceso psicológico con base biológica precisa, cuya estructura y funcionamiento se alteran en presencia de una condición menos precisa como la depresión mayor.",

Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states.

      "abstract": "Clinically occurring memory disorders are difficult to classify on the basis of the hypothetical stages of memory. Since memory functions are widely distributed in the brain, memory disturbance forms part of the clinical picture in many pathological states. These include acute conditions associated with alterations in consciousness and chronic conditions secondary to vascular, infective, neoplastic, traumatic, metabolic, and other causes. Such memory disturbances are usually non-specific, involving several stages of memory, and are overshadowed by other clinical features. Much less commonly, relatively selective memory loss occurs and memory disturbance forms the major clinical symptom. These clinical disorders provide a window through which to study the organization of memory in man.",

      "title": "Cognitive functions and social cognition in multiple sclerosis: An overview.",
      "abstract": "Cognitive decline has been widely reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) despite its clinical heterogeneity, at all stages and in all subtypes of the disease. Deficits are most commonly present in attention, processing speed, working memory, verbal fluency and executive function. However, MS patients also show decreased performance in tasks related to social cognition, i.e. mental operations thatdrive interpersonal skills such as social perception, empathy and theory of mind. Social cognitive deficits are an underestimated but important aspect of impairment in MS, reflecting how people process, store, and apply information in social interactions. Deficits in these domains have been associated with reduced social and psychological quality of life, even after controlling for severity and duration of the disease, age, and neurocognitive performance. Social cognition impairment is not entirely dependent on and parallel to general cognitive dysfunction, given that some patients experience disorganization of their social life before a significant or detectable cognitive impairment. The decrease in performance of social cognition tasks may reflect changes in brain activity and brain structure, either general or regional. Both subtle diffuse pathology and acute local lesions have at least partially independent effects on aspects of social cognition. The observed white matter damage contributes to a mechanism of disruption in the network of brain connections involved in social cognition. Undoubtedly, there is a wide variability in the relationship of social cognitionand neuroanatomical findings, not only due to the brain's complex connectivity, but also to the lack of a unique operative definition of these cognitive domains. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare study results, given the variability of clinical presentations in all stages of the disease.More research would contribute in understanding social cognition deficits better and in determining whether and what kind of training could be beneficial.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

In neurobiological terms, consciousness may be viewed as having an arousal dimension and an awareness dimension phenotypically expressed as the capacity to respond to self or environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness is associated with lesions that disrupt neuronal systems in the brainstem and diencephalon that mediate arousal or thalamocortical or corticocortical systems that mediate awareness. As there are many causes of unconsciousness, a timely and focused history and neurologic examination are critical to defining the differential diagnosis.",

During his criminal act he was probably in a pathological mental state caused by alcoholic drunkenness and decreased emotional control; besides he may have ictal or interictal disturbance of consciousness.

      "title": "1699 – Long lasting personality changes after the onset of dissociative amnesia",
      "abstract": "Across various cultures, dissociative amnesia is triggered by psychological stress or trauma. Its hallmark is a severe (usually retrograde) memory impairment, occurring without evidence of significant brain damage (as detected by conventional structural brain imaging). In a substantial number of cases, the memory impairment follows a chronic course. Sometimes dissociative amnesia occurs on a background of a personality disorder (narcissistic or borderline). Other times, amnesia itself triggers long lasting personality changes. This work's objectives are establishing greater recognition among health care providers of the spectrum of the personality changes that may accompany chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. We review data from own patients with chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically, neuropsychologically and and neuroradiologically. Changes in personality dimensions occur after the onset of amnesia. These may involve affectivity, perception (e.g. impaired self face or face-emotion processing), cognition (e.g. social cognition) and behaviour (e.g. changing in eating, smoking, drinking or working habits). The observed personality changes may represent a consequence of amnesia. Functional imaging studies show metabolic changes in dissociative amnesia in brain areas involved in conscious mnemonic processing. Several structures engaged in processing within episodic-autobiographical memory system were also implicated in self and reward-related processing. Alternatively, the personality changes may be viewed as being pivotal in the development and maintenance of dissociative amnesia; this personality shift may subsequently lead to enduring changes in ways of cognitive processing, self-processing, perception and affect.",

Mada / Madonmada is caused by various traumatic events or extreme stressors, and it is characterized by various features such as pradhyayati (immersed in thoughts/flashbacks/recurrent or persistent distressing thoughts), praswapati (excessive sleep), animittitam rodati (crying without any reason/pervasive negative emotions/depressed mood), akasmaat hasati (laughing inappropriately or without any reason/disorganized behavior), nidraalu (hypersomnia/excessive sleep), alpa vaak (diminished speech or poverty of speech/social withdrawal), nityam utsuka (hypervigilant/restlessness), trasta shareeri (tiredness/weakness), deenaaksha (depression/pervasive negative emotions), krodhana (angry outbursts/irritable behavior), nirapatrapa (self-destructive behavior/recklessness), purastaat avalokee (exaggerated startle response), na yathavritta eva (disorganized or abnormal behavior), parushatva of roma (roughness or dryness of skin and hair), and aavilam chakshusha (confused/teary eyes). Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "abstract": "table bladder, various neuroses, unilateral headache, and neuralgic irritations about the gums and teeth, together with dermatoses like angioneurotic edema and hives, dis- ordered rhino-laryngologic conditions, local fleeting pains, etc.The severe types may vary from fecal anemia to conditions simulating chlorosis, neurasthenia of the ordinary type and of types mimicking tabes, transitory frenzy, melancholia, acute confusional insanity, stupor, amnesia, emotionally exalted states, and sometimes epileptiform attacks resembling grave hysteria, but accom- panied with partial or complete loss of consciousness.One unpleasant and frequent mental state in other- wise logical auto-toxemics is nosophobia, or worry over the possibility of disease.This differs from hypochondria in the fact that the subject does not think he has a particular disease, but fears he may have.The irregular action of his organs resulting from auto-toxemia intrudes on his consciousness and causes a fear or uncer- tainty as to his actual state.That paretic dementia and tabes are often due to the toxin of syphilis is now gener- ally admitted.The clinical history of some cases would indicate that auto-toxemia has here played its part more especially, as it has been demonstrated beyond cavil that temporary auto-toxemic neuroses mimic these two great constitutional disorders.The fact is but too often for- gotten that the law of periodicity of the nervous sys- tem fixes a tendency of certain symptoms to recur from a slighter exciting cause.Hence, frequently recurring auto-intoxication causes that breakdown of the vaso- motor balance which constitutes the underlying basis of tabes and paretic dementia.Diagnosis in conditions of auto-intoxication is, there- fore, not so simple as it first seems.Owing to the ten- dency of the neuroses with an underlying vasomotor factor to remit or assume temporary appearances of health, the distinction between the deep forms of auto- intoxication and these neuroses becomes at times difficult.This difficulty is intensified by the fact that auto- intoxication, in a hereditarily defective or acquired neu- ropathic constitution, may cause marked and decided symptoms of less augury than when found in a healthy constitution.Auto-intoxication occurring in puberty often temporarily initiates seemingly serious puberty neuroses and psychoses.The same is true of the climac- teric end of the senile period.In all these cases the con- dition produced by auto-intoxication has the clinical tinge of the period in which it appears.This is why treatment directed to a change of environment and the habits of the individual so often produces favorable ef- fects on seeming senile and climacteric breakdown.The grave auto-intoxication resembling tabes and allied conditions are differentiated as a rule by the state of the reflexes as to absence of stupor, melancholia and acute confusional insanity, as well as amnesia, and differ little from the ordinary types except in their compara- tive quickness of response to treatment.This, however, is only a relative test, since in no case of these affections is auto-intoxication absent as an etiologic factor.The convulsive types of auto-intoxication differ from epilepsy in their inffequency and absence of recurrence.Practically the status of the auto-intoxicated is as brief as that of-the epileptic is prolonged.The therapeutics of auto-intoxication will depend on the type.In irritable weakness, while removal from surroundings is desirable for permanent recovery, much may be attained by regulation of diet, use of the mineral waters, regular, moderate exercise and massage, as well as hydrotherapy.Here, as in all cases of auto-intoxica-",

Transient global amnesia is sometimes precipitated by a psychological or physiological stress. Transient global amnesia also must be distinguished from psychogenic amnesia and from factitious amnesia. Usually no physical symptoms are associated with transient global amnesia. Any physical symptoms should raise the possibility of an alternative etiology for the patient's amnesia. The characteristic presentation of transient global amnesia is a sudden loss of ability to form new memories. Patients who develop transient global amnesia generally are taken by companions to an emergency room. Neuropsychological testing after multiple attacks may reveal more memory impairment as well as visuoperceptual deficits. Transient global amnesia is rare in young or middle-age adults. It is relatively common in individuals who are over 50 years old.",

Sympathetic hyperactivity manifests with hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, hyperhidrosis, peripheral vasoconstriction, and hyperthermia or hypothermia.Massive sympathoexcitation can lead to intracranial hemorrhage, vasogenic brain edema, congestive heart failure, apical ballooning (Takotsubo) syndrome, and neurogenic pulmonary edema. Less commonly, autonomic hyperactivity also involves the parasympathetic system and manifests primarily with bradyarrhythmia or even syncope. Common causes of autonomic hyperactivity are head trauma, hypoxic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury, Guillain-Barré syndrome,and iatrogenic disorders such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome.Autonomic hyperactivity in the setting of cognitive, psychiatric or sleep disturbances suggests alcohol (or other depressant drug) withdrawal, fatal insomnia, or limbic encephalitis. Patients with autonomic hyperactivity should be managed in an intensive care unit as they require continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, respiration, and fluid balance.",

Neurological complications increase the length of ICU and hospital stay, and reduce the likelihood of return to independent living. Minor neurological complications are very common and often go undiagnosed. It is now recognized that transient and early postoperative problems such as confusion, agitation, and delirium – previously considered self-limiting nuisances – are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a decline in cognitive function in the early postoperative period is predictive of late (five-year) cognitive decline. General considerations Clinical spectrum The spectrum of central nervous system injury during and after cardiac surgery encompasses a wide range of clinical entities ranging from death or persistent vegetative state to subtle changes in memory and concentration: Neurological injury may be: immediate – apparent soon after the patient recovers from anaesthesia; or delayed – with onset after a...",

      "title": "Amnesia and the Amnestic Syndrome",
      "abstract": "A close relationship seems to exist both clinically and psychopathologically between impairment of consciousness and its consequence in memory function-circumscribed amnesia-and the amnestic or Korsakow syndrome. In many cases an amnestic syndrome develops out of conditions of loss or impairment of consciousness or it initiates a clinical course which leads to impairment or loss of consciousness and eventually even to death. Although in such cases the amnestic syndrome is usually of short duration, numerically they seem to be more frequent than the chronic symptomatologically unchanging cases which one sees in alcoholics and seniles. Psychopathologically amnesia represents an unselective loss of memory for a limited period of time, due to lack or impairment of perceptual awareness. The amnestic syndrome on the other hand represents a selective type of memory dysfunction whereby recent personal memories cannot be recalled. It seems to be due to impairment of an integrative function other than perceptual awareness namely awareness of the personal meaning of events which is necessary for the registration of events as personal experiences available for future recall. Intact perceptual awareness is an essential pre-requisite for awareness of personal meaning but the latter is also dependent on the emotional charge of the situation. Consequently lesions and processes involving those structures of the brain functionally responsible for perceptual awareness and/or for emotional functions may be expected to lead to an amnestic syndrome. This is born out by neuropathological findings which demonstrate pathological changes in the hypothalamus in cases with impairment of consciousness and in the mammillary bodies with Korsakow's syndrome. The mammillary bodies form part of the activating system responsible for conscious perceptual awareness as well as of Papez' harmonious mechanism of the emotions.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "abstract": "Depression often accompanies a medical condition. It may also happen that the presence of a chronic disease changes the social situation of a patient, who then responds to the change by developing depression. Among the various systemic diseases, endocrine diseases, viral infections, collagen disease, pancreatic cancer, vitamin B12 deficiency, and folic acid deficiency are particularly likely to cause depression. Drugs, including interferon, methyldopa, and steroids, may also be the cause of depression. The depression seen in organic brain disease (secondary depres- sion) includes depression in convalescence from disturbance of consciousness caused by head trauma or encephalitis, poststroke depression, and depression in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases. The symptoms of depression associated with a medical condition are basically the same as those in endogenous depression, including depressed mood, sadness, diminished mental activity, and impatience. However, depression associated with chronic organic brain disorders is characterized by the predominant symptoms of diminished intellectual capacity, apathetic tendency, lability of mood, retardation in thinking and speech, and flat affect, whereas depressive mood, insomnia, anorexia, low self- esteem, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicidal ideation are mild.",

Parasomnias are unusual behaviors occurring during sleep: arousal disorders; sleep-wake transition disorders; disorders associated with rapid eye movement sleep; and other disorders. The risk of developing late posttraumatic seizures is strongly determined by the severity of brain injury. Hypersomnia is excessive sleepiness or sleeping and has a variety of psychological or physiological causes. Epilepsy is a recurrent brain disorder of multiple etiologies and is characterized by recurrent seizures due to the excessive discharge of cerebral neurones.",

It includes high-level cortical functions such as memory, language, perception, and executive function (planning, initiating, and reasoning) that generally depend on the alert state and focused attention. Dysfunction of cognition without a change in consciousness may result in various disorders, including aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, executive dysfunction, and memory disorders such as dementia and amnesia. Transient dysfunction of cognition associated with a change in level of consciousness or attention may be due to delirium or confusional states.

One of the important developments in the modern understanding of DDs is the establishment of a clearer link between trauma and dissociation. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is the most popular, widely discussed, and recognized of the DDs. Pathological possession has been included as a symptom of DID in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Dissociative amnesia represents the classical functional disorder of episodic memory. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDRD) involves lack of integration of one or more components of perception and characterizes by \"the presence of recurrent or persistent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both\". The symptoms of depersonalization and/or derealization frequently co-occur in a variety of other psychiatric disorders, primarily in patients with anxiety disorders.",

The site of noncerebral trauma has been described by the Abbreviated Injury Scale as head or neck, face, chest, abdomen or pelvic contents, extremities or pelvic girdle, external. Neurobehavioral and adaptive dysfunctions after an accident are diverse and complex. There are characteristic sensorimotor and cognitive symptoms, for example, dizziness, visual and balance symptoms.

Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

In extremely stressful situation the cognitive functions of the depressive individuals may impaired to such an extent that they may have the feeling of entrapment for which they may take the way of suicidal acts for escape. A number of brain regions that are involved in higher cognitive functions are altered in depression patients, suicidal individuals and in complete suicides. Along with the morphological changes, monoaminergic neurotransmission system is also severely deteriorated in these brain regions indicating their possible involvements in regulating cognitive activities. Monoaminergic dysfunctions may give rise to serious cognitive impairments and deterioration of associated mental functions required for maintaining normal internal homeostasis. Loss of cognitive functions makes an individual incapable to interact properly to various aspects of normal life functions making them depressive and severe depression may be the forerunner of suicidal acts.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is the most serious and disabling of all mental disorders, affecting just under 1 % of the population. While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described.

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a type of emotional dysfunction caused by genetic abnormalities or great changes in the patient’s environment, which can manifest as a host of symptoms such as persistent and spontaneous depression with changes in cognitive function. According to worldwide statistics, 50% of suicides each year occur during episodes of depression, and patients with MDD are 20 times more likely to commit suicide than the general population.",

Visual hallucinations may reflect delirium or neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Lewy body disease. This chapter focuses only on non-schizophrenic late-life psychosis. Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

      "abstract": "The defining feature of neurocognitive disorders is a decline in cognitive functioning. Patients suffering from delirium experience an acute change in mental status, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an inability to acquire new information. Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

A growing body of research also demonstrates that SCT is uniquely associated with poorer functioning in various domains of major life activities, including academic difficulties (including poor organization, homework problems, and lower grade point average), social problems (especially peer withdrawal and isolation), and emotion dysregulation. SCT is less clearly associated with most neuropsychological performance outcomes with the possible exceptions of sustained attention, processing speed, and motor speed.",

      "abstract": "Success at school increases self-esteem. Any difficulty will have consequential effects on the psychological health of the subject. The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

      "abstract": "L'enuresi primitiva (essenziale notturna) può essere definita come una minzione involontaria che avviene di notte durante il sonno, mentre nel corso della giornata la minzione è normalmente controllata, ed ha perciò caratteri peculiari. Il notare, a volte, nei bambini affetti da enuresi primitiva la concomitanza di piccoli disturbi psichici o emozionali, di piccolo male, di stati di ipervagotonia o spasmofilia, conferma la natura funzionale complessa dell'affezione, sulla quale influiscono in prevalenza turbe della vita psichica o degli interessi affettivi del bambino. Alcuni dei fattori psichici implicati nell'enuresi (mancinismo, infantilismo nei giochi o discorsi, terrori notturni, fobie) possono anche essere considerati come indice di una incompleta maturazione psichica. Non vogliamo qui discutere sull'etiopatogenesi della malattia, che è tuttora piuttosto oscura. La maggioranza degli autori considera l'enuresi primitiva come un disturbo funzionale complesso, non legato ad alterazioni dell'innervazione o della maturazione delle strutture nervose e muscolari preposte alla funzione vescicale, ma piuttosto riportabile ad alterazioni (o ritardo) del meccanismo volontario della minzione. Si parla di enuresi primitiva quando il controllo anche notturno della minzione non è stato raggiunto entro i primi tre anni di vita. Secondo Harrison (1967), a 5 anni l'enuresi è presente nel 15% dei maschi e nel 10% delle femmine, a 9 anni nel 5%. Il disturbo cessa spontaneamente alla pubertà in quasi tutti i casi.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

Su evolucion natural sin tratamiento puede derivar en serias repercusiones negativas en el funcionamiento academico, social y familiar de los ninos, interfiriendo de forma importante en el desarrollo. Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

TGA is typically described as amnesia of sudden onset regarding events of the present and the recent past (2). It can be caused by central vascular or ischemic lesions. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but includes laboratory tests and radiologic evaluation. TGA typically remits spontaneously, but may recur. There is no specific treatment for amnesia. General stabilization of the patient is indicated (2). Many patients are anxious or agitated and may repeatedly ask questions concerning transpiring events. In the neurologic examination only disturbed memory can be found (3). Upon mental status examination, language function is preserved, which indicates a preservation of semantic and syntax memory. Attention is spared, visual-spatial skills are intact, and social skills are retained. Symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. As the syndrome resolves, the amnesia improves, but the patient may be left with a distinct lapse of recollection for events during the attack. The patient’s behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about his/her immediate circumstances (e.g., “What am I doing here?”; “How did we get here?”) (4). Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most potent effects on shortterm episodic and working memory in humans (5). Marijuana is used by inhalation in cigars or taken orally. When it is taken by the oral route its effects are seen in a delayed manner, so the inhalation type is used mostly to achieve the desired psychoactive effects (6). After al the cigar was burnt, the peak effects are seen in 20 minutes and disappear in 3 hours. A cigar of marijuana contains 5-20 mg THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Approximately 50% of the THC pass to the alveolar spaces. The most encountered psychotropic side effects of THC are; lethargy, sedation, euphoria, psychological relaxation, euphoria and sometimes, inhibition of the psychological inhibitions as alcohol does, disturbance in the perception of time and location (like feeling of delays in time and elongation of the distances), disturbance in the Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) has been a well-described phenomenon for more than 40 years. It presents with a paroxysmal, transient loss of memory. Immediate recall ability and remote memory are preserved. However, patiens experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. In some cases, the degree of retrograde memory loss is mild. Marijuana induced transient global amnesia is a rare side effect. Here, we present a case of memory loss for a short period of time after use of marijuana. (JAEM 2012; 11: 190-2)",

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause.

Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

Although there are few diagnostically specific findings, patterns of association have emerged: where action is impeded (certain forms of conversion disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome) frontal systems of the brain are often implicated; when subjective awareness of the body is disturbed (passivity phenomena and anorexia nervosa) temporo-parietal cortices appear to be dysfunctional. The caudate nuclei (components of the frontal executive circuit) are implicated in a variety of syndromes (including body dysmorphic disorder, somatisation and chronic fatigue).

      "abstract": "The term dementia has become common parlance but is often used incorrectly. Dementia refers to the clinical condition or syndrome of cognitive impairment that is sufficiently severe to interfere with social and work activities. It is frequently conflated with Alzheimer's disease which is only one, albeit the commonest, of many diseases that can cause dementia. Damage to the blood supply to the brain often resulting in minor strokes, vascular dementia, is less common with the better control of high blood pressure and reduction in smoking. The majority of people living with dementia will have a neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's, characterised by loss of memory. Other causes include dementia with Lewy bodies that overlaps with Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal degeneration. The latter most commonly presents with changes in behaviour such as disinhibition, loss of empathy and stereotypies. It can also present with speech and language deficits. The precise syndromic diagnosis is important for understanding carer burden and may have specific impact on psychoanalytic and psychotherapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), alone or in combination with other pathology, is the most common cause of dementia in people over age 65. The defining features of Alzheimer's dementia are progressive deficits in memory and other aspects of cognition, typically including language, praxis, visual and spatial processing, and executive function at some point during the course of the illness. Noncognitive phenomena, including apathy and unawareness, are important contributors to the burden of disease. At the same time, elemental neurological function, and therefore the general neurological exam, is usually normal, although paratonia and/or myoclonus may be present. These deficits result in reduced ability to perform daily activities, and most Alzheimer's dementia patients will become totally dependent on others unless they die of other causes first. The clinical presentation of Alzheimer's dementia is the result of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss that follow a predictable distribution in the brain. The hippocampus, limbic cortex, and polymodal association cortex sustain the greatest damage. Dysfunction in these regions results in the characteristic clinical pattern of Alzheimer's dementia and assists in its clinical differentiation from other dementing illnesses, which follow different anatomical patterns of neuronal dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

These physical complaints are not consistent with the clinical picture of known, verifiable, conventionally defined diseases, and are unsupported by clinical or paraclinical findings. The phenomenon of medically unexplained symptoms cannot simply be classified into one or a few diagnostic categories, but must be regarded as an expression of a basic mechanism by which people may respond to stressors as in the cases of depression and anxiety. Somatization disorder and related disorders must thus be considered to possess a spectrum of severity. In this chapter, the focus will be on the chronic and multisymptomatic forms.",

      "abstract": "Amnesia is the name given to disorders of memory. Amnesia normally involves severe forgetfulness which goes beyond the everyday forgetting observed in normal people, to the extent that it may interfere with the activities of normal life. We are all prone to moments of forgetfulness, but most people with intact cognitive functioning can remember quite a lot about the events in their lives, especially their most recent experiences and events which are important to them. However, a person suffering from amnesia may be quite unable to remember any recent events in their lives, even the most important ones. You can probably recall quite easily where you were five minutes ago, or the person you just chatted with, or even what you did yesterday evening. Many amnesics would be unable to remember these simple things, and may have no idea of what they have done with their day so far. In severe cases they may be quite unable to commit any new experiences to memory, and this can be very disruptive to their lives. Without an intact memory it can become impossible to keep a job, to keep up relationships with family and friends, or even to look after oneself and maintain an independent existence. In fact it is clear from the study of severely amnesic patients that memory is quite crucial to our ability to function properly as human beings. Amnesia is a very disruptive and distressing condition. However, it is also a disorder from which a great deal can be learned about the nature of memory function.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.",

Normal aging process of organ systems and increased geriatric comorbidities render them vulnerable to accidental injuries and delayed management of treatable medical conditions in an isolated home environment.

Diogenes Syndrome is an extreme form of fatal self-neglect for individuals in social isolation with hoarding of rubbish or household items.

Reactive depressive syndromes can be associated with the restriction of social competence due to increasing multi-morbidity, loneliness, social isolation, the consequences of retirement, interpersonal conflicts, and the loss of partners or close relatives. Endogenous depressive syndromes in the elderly are frequently combined with diffuse and changing somatic complaints, psychomotor restlessness and agitation. Furthermore, depressive syndromes can be caused by somatic illness, degenerative disorders, other organic diseases or certain drugs. The presence of simultaneously occurring somatic illness, positive family history, certain personality traits, and severity of disease could exert an adverse influence on clinical outcome.

The most difficult is to diagnose depression with onset in early childhood, including infant's age, when the psychopathological presentations depend on the consequences of the perinatal CNS lesion, maternal deprivation and other factors. In children, the clinical picture of depression differs by syndromologic incompleteness, peculiarity of phenomenological presentations and polymorphism of disorders. In adolescence, depression is characterized by the predominance of behavioral disorders, marked psychopathic-like disorders, suicidal attempts, higher frequency of bipolar forms. Depression with late age at onset differs by the abundance of somatic and hypochondriac complaints, anxiety and depressive delusion accompanied by the transitory aggravation of cognitive impairment (depressive pseudodementia).",

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychosis is a severe, acute or chronic mental illness that is characterized by reality distortion, delusions, hallucinations, disorganization, catatonia, and impaired insight. Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

Akinesia is a behavioral state of diminished motoric and psychic spontaneity that is difficult to distinguish from the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The most useful clinical correlates of akinesia are a subjective sense of sedation and excessive sleeping. Akinesia interferes with social adjustment and may manifest as \"postpsychotic depression.\" The subjective restlessness of akathisia is usually accompanied by telltale foot movements: rocking from foot to foot while standing or walking on the spot. Akathisia is strongly associated with depression and dysphoric responses to neuroleptics and has even been linked to suicidal and homicidal behavior in extreme cases.",

Generalized anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance Irritability The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause",

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

It is the clinical expression for a group of symptoms, the result of failure of important functions of the body, as those of circulation, respiration, excretion and secretion, and general metabolism. A lowered bodily temperature is a more or less constant phenomenon. Shock is intimately connected with the nervous mechanism. In studying shock from anesthesia it is not only essential to consider the specific toxin of the anesthetic used, but the resulting toxic bodies generated through the immediate or more remote influence of general anesthesia. Shock can not, therefore, be expressed in a single definition. The phenomena of shock are so complex that in experimental work on animals it is necessary to study each condition separately, and compile the associated facts obtained and compare",

Uma das causas da síndrome demêncial é a hidrocefalia normobárica (HNB), a qual afeta principalmente pessoas idosas, sendo possivelmente resultado de algum trauma ou doença, ainda que as causas exatas não estejam totalmentes claras. Esta pode ser apresentada com a clássica tríade: distúrbio de marcha (atáxica ou apráxica), demência e incontinência urinária e, é definida pelo acúmulo do líquido cefalorraquidiano (LCR ou líquor) nas cavidades ventriculares cranianas. O LCR banha o cérebro e a medula espinhal tendo como uma de suas finalidades a de evitar que possíveis traumas atinjam e comprometam o funcionamento adequado do sistema nervoso central (SNC). O diagnóstico dessa doença pode ser difícil e, muitas vezes ser confundido com outras patologias como o mal de Parkinson e o Alzheimer, além disso, o quadro clínico destas doenças podem estar sobrepostos e, muitas vezes, pacientes tratados para HNB podem estar sofrendo também de outra condição.

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

Akinetic mutism is a prolonged state of relative immobility and silence; the patient may appear awake and may visually track the examiner around the room. Neurologic examination and the occasional occurrence of complex motor activity and speech indicate that this behavioral disturbance is not due to lesions of the elementary motor and speech areas. Bilateral discrete lesions of the rostral brain-stem or basomedian frontal regions may result in this syndrome.1 In the \"locked-in\" syndrome intact consciousness is concealed . . .",

It is characterized by impairment of mental functions leading to memory loss, behavioural changes, and impairment in the activities of daily living. It may be caused by several different diseases, the most common being Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and Lewy body dementia. There are other potentially treatable causes, including depression, which must be excluded. Drug treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors may reduce the progression of dementia for a period, especially in Alzheimer’s disease. Antipsychotic drugs should be used with great care. The associated impairment and behavioural problems often requires social care, sometimes in institutions, and will place an increasing burden on medical services and society.",

Major depression is heterogeneous in its expression, possessing various phenomenology, family history, and course. In the elderly, a neurochemical characteristic of depression would have to be specific enough to distinguish from dementia, or from secondary depression. In addition, neurochemical differences would be expected between late-onset and early-onset depression, or delusional and nondelusional depression, thus helping to validate these putative subtypes.",

      "abstract": "Depression and dementia can lead to generalised cognitive and memory dysfunction. Thus, differentiating these disorders is important and challenging. Pseudodementia is a term used clinically to describe symptoms that resemble dementia but are caused by other conditions (most frequently depression), rather than being recognised as an official diagnosis. Pseudodementia is characterised by a cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but which does not have its origin in neurological degeneration, deriving instead from functional psychiatric conditions. This condition is more commonly observed in older adults (particularly those over the age of 50 or 60 years), and its risk factors overlap with those for depression. Pseudodementia is essentially characterised by deficits in memory, executive function and speech and, therefore, can easily be confused with dementia, although there are aspects that allow its differentiation. Diagnosing pseudodementia can be difficult, especially as there is significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions. However, it is important to recognise characteristic aspects of this disorder, as its correct identification is essential for proper treatment.",

Attention encompasses generalized activation of the cognitive processes of orienting, filtering, and selecting inputs; preparing for action; and maintaining thought on a stimulus, mental activity, or goal. Attention, a vital foundation for higher cognitive functions, maintains a coherent stream of thought. The ability to sustain attention, or vigilance, is necessary for complex behaviors, such as understanding and remembering a story. Therefore, attention must be tested first, before other cognitive functions. An inattentive patient’s failure to perform calculations sheds no light on arithmetic skills. Rather, attentional dysfunction is a central feature of syndromes due to diffuse cerebral dysfunction such as delirium, as well as syndromes due to focal cerebral damage such as the neglect syndrome. In addition, attentional dysfunction often accompanies other cognitive impairments in such common neurological.",

Secondary dystonia may be further classifi ed into symptomatic dystonia and the dystonia-plus syndromes. Symptomatic dystonia is due to an identifi able brain disease, an obvious brain or peripheral insult, or a hereditary or sporadic degeneration of the brain. The dystonia-plus syndromes (1) have accompanying neurological signs and/or clinical and laboratory fi ndings suggestive of neurochemical disorders, without evidence of an underlying neurodegenerative process (Box 17.1).",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "title": "AB1367 EFFECTIVENESS OF REHABILITATION STRATEGIES IN PRIMARY FIBROMYALGIA SYNDROME: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic inconsistent widespread pain and tenderness. It is also associated with other comorbid symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairments (memory and mood disturbances), and/or irritable bowel syndrome. <sup>[1]</sup> Prevalence of fibromyalgia is 2.7% globally, being slightly higher in middle aged women (4-9%). 75 to 100 % patients with fibromyalgia face depression, anxiety and/or stress. The probability of occurrence of depression is almost 40% at any stage in the course of fibromyalgia. <sup>[2]</sup> Patients usually report physical symptoms of depression (e.g. appetite, sleep, and sexual dysfunction) rather than mood-related psychological symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation, low self-esteem), however depression is affective expression of chronic pain and neuromarkers of both cannot be isolate. <sup>[3]</sup> Reviews done till date are either oriented toward specific form of exercise or towards specific outcome. We could not come across any review which included all form of exercise with measurement of multiple outcomes. <h3>Objectives</h3> The aim of this review was to 1) summarize evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 2) determine the most effective rehabilitation strategy for reducing pain and depression in people with FMS. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed, Ovid (Sp), and Cochrane search engines were used for identifying the studies done till 1 July 2022. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that have passive control group and active control group were included in this review for primary and secondary aim respectively. The primary outcome measures were Pain and depression. Secondary outcome was one from the sleep or fatigue or healthy related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 25 RCTs were included. Separate random effect model meta-analysis is performed for randomised control trial with active and passive control group. Mean difference or Standard Mean difference with 95% confidence interval used to assess the effect size. Studies with passive control group showed moderate to large positive effects on pain (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.38; I2 = 72%) and HRQOL(MD -5.40, 95% CI -10.17 to -0.62; I2 = 74%) but non-significant for sleep, fatigue, and depression. Furthermore, on subgroup analysis studies with short term protocol showed significant effect on pain only, whereas studies with long term protocols showed positive effect on pain and HRQOL only but non-significant at the time of post-trial follow-up. Studies with active control group represent non- significant results except mixed exercises which showed positive effect (MD -4.78, 95% CI -7.98 to -1.57; I2 = 0%) for HRQOL. <h3>Conclusion</h3> All rehabilitation strategies were effective for pain and HRQOL, and has marginal effect on depression, sleep, and fatigue but efficacy was not maintained at the time of post-trial follow-up. However, in this review we could not differentiate any rehabilitation strategies for the best among those used in the included studies. <h3>References</h3> [1]Queiroz LP.

      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "abstract": "There is often difficulty differentiating between psychosomatic, somatopsychic, multisystem illness, and different degrees of medical uncertainty. Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

Delirium can interfere dramatically with the recognition and control of other physical and psychological symptoms such as pain in later stages of illness. Delirium is one of the most common mental disorders encountered in general hospital practice. Delirium is highly prevalent in cancer and AIDS patients with advanced disease, particularly in the terminally ill patients in the last weeks of life, with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 88%. Many of the clinical features and symptoms of delirium can also be associated with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, mania, psychosis, and dementia.",

      "title": "[Perioperative disorders of mental functions].",
      "abstract": "Mental disorders are characterized by disturbances of thought, perception, affect and behavior, which occur as a result of brain damage. Recognizing and treating these conditions is necessary not only for psychiatrists but for all physicians. Disorder of mental function is one of the most common associated conditions in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, disturbances of mental function often remain unrecognized. In ICU patients, different types of mental function disorders may develop. They range from sleep disorders, severe depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cognitive disorders including delirium. The causes of mental dysfunction in ICU patients can be divided into environmental and medical. Cognitive disorders are related to mental processes such as learning ability, memory, perception and problem solving. Cognitive disorders are usually not prominent in the early postoperative period and in many cases are discovered after hospital discharge because of difficulties in performing everyday activities at home or at work. The etiology of postoperative cognitive impairment is unclear. Older age, previous presence of cognitive dysfunction, severity of disease, and polypharmacy with more than four drugs are some of the risk factors identified. Delirium is a multifactorial disorder. It is an acute confusional state characterized by alteration of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. It is considered as the most common form of mental distress in ICU patients. Nearly 30% of all hospitalized patients pass through deliriant phase during their hospital stay. Delirium can last for several days to several weeks. Almost always it ends with complete withdrawal of psychopathological symptoms. Sometimes it can evolve into a chronic brain syndrome (dementia). The causes are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease the symptoms. Delirious patient is at risk of complications of immobility and confusion, leading to a high prevalence of irreversible functional decline. An interdisciplinary approach to delirium should also include family or other caregivers. In the diagnosis of delirium, several tests are used to complement clinical assessment. Among the most commonly used are the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test. Depression is a common disorder among patients treated at ICU and occurs due to the impact of the disease on the body and the quality of life, independence, employment and other aspects of life. Depression can interfere with the speed of recovery, affects the postoperative quality of life, and in a certain number of patients may lead to suicidal thoughts and intentions. Phobias and generalized anxiety are the most common anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by strong, excessive anxiety and worry about everyday life events. PTSD is delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation, extremely threatening or catastrophic nature, which is outside the common experience of people and would hit or traumatize almost all people. Treatment of delirium and other disorders is causal. The causes of psychosis are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease symptoms. The primary objective of prevention is appropriate therapy and correction of potential imbalances possibly underlying disturbances, stabilization of vital functions as well as early return to daily activities. Doctors and other medical staff must be aware of the importance and consequences of behavioral and emotional disorders in critically ill patients. Additional research is needed to discover the ways to prevent and/ or reduce the frequency and severity of the consequences and treatment of cognitive and emotional disorders.",

A la suite des premieres observations de troubles de l'action et de l'affect (apathie, apragmatisme, indifference affective, perte d'interet), consecutives a la destruction, selective mais bilaterale, des noyaux pallidaux, est nee la notion de syndrome athymhormique, concu comme un trouble specifique de la capacite des sujets a convertir leurs affects en action. Outre cette pathologie de la motivation proprement dite, les patients decrivent souvent, mais non toujours, une experience tres particuliere de vide mental, laissant presumer que les systemes en cause controlent egalement certains aspects de l'activite mentale spontanee.

      "abstract": "Symptoms of depression that are temporary or caused by physical illness can be difficult to differentiate from those that represent a depressive disorder. A diagnosis of depressive disorder depends on the underlying cause, and on the nature, severity and duration of symptoms. Management involves accurate diagnosis and treatment of medical illness, practical interventions to resolve concurrent family, social and economic stressors, and emotional support. Cognitive, behavioral and brief psychodynamic therapies may be helpful in selected cases. Antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy have a role in the treatment of severe or persistent depression associated with suicidal behavior, marked psychomotor retardation, starvation or other life-threatening symptoms. Suicidal thoughts are frequent in older patients with concurrent major depression and chronic illness, and measures to ensure patient safety are a priority.",

      "abstract": "A prerequisite to the diagnosis of vegetative state is the exclusion of apparently similar syndromes, in which the patient retains the consciousness partially or even completely. Some syndromes are not separate nosological entities and should be abandoned: the apallic state, the neocortical death, the decerebrate and decorticate state, the alpha-coma, the vigil or prolonged or irreversible coma are among them. Three conditions deserve special consideration. The term locked-in syndrome describes a patient completely paralysed and mute, but fully conscious, and is usually caused by ischemic lesions of the pons. Several variants do exist, either in the causes and site of lesion. Some patients may become paralysed and mute, but conscious because of polyneuropathies, that is in the absence of any lesions of the central nervous system. The akinetic mutism is a rare condition characterised by loss of speech and nearly absent bodily movements. Painful stimulation may cause appropriate withdrawing, and wakefulness and self-awareness may be preserved, but cognitive impairment is usually present. It must be emphasised that this condition can be due to potentially treatable lesions, such as hydrocephalus and craniopharyngioma. The term \"minimally responsive\" or \"minimally conscious\" describes severely disabled patients in whom meaningful responses can be demonstrated, although inconstantly. This condition, the true diagnostic challenge, often represents a transition phase of vegetative patients recovering consciousness. Physicians, physiotherapists and patient's relatives should work all together to reach a correct diagnosis, by using current available methods to monitorize the recovery of consciousness.",

The clinical manifestations were characterized by peculiar emotional disorders, polymorphous autonomic and vascular shifts. These states occurred in the majority of cases after some somatic diseases in conjunction with other physical or psychological stresses in individuals with anxiety traits and 'neurocirculatory asthenia'. The first phase of the disease was accompanied by anxiety, restlessness, autonomic and vascular paroxysms, anorexia, insomnia and disturbances of other physiological functions. Subsequently dysphoric mood, somatic concerns, pseudoneurotic and neurotic syndromes appeared. The outcome of the disorders was either with slow practical recovery or with a relatively stable personality change in the form of weakened volition, a reduction of energy, and a narrowing of the 'zone of comfort' due to the impairment of homeostatic functions. Often hypochondriasis could develop on the background of such features. Dysthymia is viewed as a special entity which must not be included either in the group of neuroses or in the group of typical organic brain syndromes, or in the group of endogenous psychoses.",

      "abstract": "Acquired brain injury is an umbrella term that encompasses traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and non-traumatic brain injuries. Approximately 150,000 Canadians will sustain an ABI on an annual basis. An ABI is damage to the brain that is not due to a congenital or degenerative disorder. Occurring after birth, ABI can be caused by a traumatic event or external force (e.g., motor vehicle accident, sports injury), or a non-traumatic event or internal factor (e.g., infection, tumour). Injury to the brain can result in temporary or permanent physical (e.g., movement issues, spasticity, chronic pain), cognitive (e.g., impaired speech, memory loss), and/or emotional (e.g., depression, anger issues) impairments.As 1 of the major physical impairments resulting from an ABI, muscle spasticity is often described as muscle over-activity and is characterized by ongoing muscle contractions that are partly due to a decrease in skeletal stretch reflex threshold. Occurring spontaneously or continuously, spasticity typically affects muscles in the neck and upper and lower limbs. Spasticity can result in a variety of musculoskeletal issues such as involuntary shaking, joint stiffness, muscle contracture, and limited range of movement. This debilitating condition may limit one’s ability to perform the activities of daily living, impact one’s quality of life, and require additional assistance from caregivers.The treatment of ABI-related spasticity can involve a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological options may include casting and splinting to maintain positioning, stretching and strengthening to improve control of spastic muscles, and/or transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation to help reduce pain. Pharmacological options can be administered systemically (e.g., oral baclofen, tizanidine, clonidine, dantrolene sodium) or locally (e.g., injection of botulinum toxin type A [BoNT-A], phenol, baclofen). Botulinum toxin (BoNT), a neurotoxic protein produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria, exists in multiple subtypes (i.e., A to G) and formulations.BoNT-A intramuscular injection is used to treat spasticity by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in activating skeletal muscles. BoNT-A injections result in temporary local paresis (i.e., partial paralysis) and may help to improve pain. BoNT-A is approved for various indications (i.e., not exclusive to spasticity), and is available as 3 formulations in North America: onabotulinum toxin A (Botox), abobotulinum toxin A (Dysport), and incobotulinum toxin A (Xeomin). Due to different manufacturing processes and pharmacological activities, these 3 formulations are not considered interchangeable products. This report focuses on onabotulinum toxin A, which will be referred to herein as Botox — its brand name.The body of evidence evaluating treatment options for spasticity after brain injury is limited in quality and quantity, and there is uncertainty regarding the clinical effectiveness of Botox for this population. Another 2021 CADTH rapid review report focused on the use of Botox for the treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. The aim of this rapid review report is to summarize and critically appraise the relevant evidence on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of Botox for the treatment of ABI-associated spasticity.",

Cognitive impairment (CI) is one of the most intensively studied aspects of pathological anxiety. Impairments in attention, executive functions, memory, cognitive deficit, as well as abnormal cognitions and metacognitions are identified in anxiety disorders. Moreover, the treatment of the latter with the most frequently used drugs (antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, tranquilizers) does not lead to a significant improvement in cognitive functions, and often contributes to their worsening. In this connection, in addition to psychotherapy, cognitive function-improving agents play a large role in treating anxiety diseases associated with cognitive dysfunction. Ginkgo Biloba extract (EGb 761, Tanakan®) that positively affects cognitive functions, especially in the domains of memory, concentration and attention deserves special attention.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

Inability to show dissatisfaction and inhibition of one's own aggressive tendencies are characteristic of depressive neurosis.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

Major depressive disorder is thought to result from the complex interplay of multiple inherited genetic factors and subsequent exposure to a wide range of environmental variables throughout life. The reciprocal connections between various brain regions and the neurochemical messengers involved in these connections are being increasingly studied from a systematic perspective. Furthermore,researchers are increasingly considering the impact of an individual psy- chosocial environment on brain chemistry,activity and anatomy,and vice versa.

      "title": "Cognitive Effects and Sedation",
      "abstract": "Cognitive effects and sedation (CES) are prevalent in chronic nonmalignant pain populations receiving long-term opioid therapy and are among the most common reasons patients discontinue opioid use. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, epidemiology, mechanisms, assessment, and management of opioid-related CES. We reviewed the empirical and theoretical literature on CES in opioid-treated populations with chronic pain. Data on long-term opioid therapy (≥3 months in duration) in chronic nonmalignant pain patients were sought. The phenomenology of CES includes: inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, psychomotor dysfunction, perceptual distortions, and executive dysfunction and somnolence, sleep disorders, and lethargy. Deficits may be caused by unrelieved pain or opioid therapy alone, or from a combination of these and other factors. Mechanisms include central nervous system effects, for example, direct toxic effects on neurons resulting in decreased consciousness; direct effects on processing and reaction resulting in cognitive or psychomotor impairment, and inhibitory effects on cholinergic activity. Pharmacological management approaches may include opioid dose reduction and rotation or psychostimulant use. Nonpharmacological approaches may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, and yoga. The most prevalent CES include: memory deficits (73–81%), sleep disturbance (35–57%), and fatigue (10%). At its most severe, extreme cognitive dysfunction can result in frank delirium and decreased alertness can result in coma. Emotional distress, sleep disorders, and other comorbidities and treatments can worsen CES, particularly among the elderly. Conclusions about the neuropsychological domains affected by opioids are limited due to the heterogeneity of studies and methodological issues.",

      "abstract": "Executive functioning is a high-level cognitive ability, regulating other abilities and behaviors to achieve desired goals. A typical executive task can be defined as the capacity to maintain one’s attention on the current task, that is, responding only to the correct but not to distractive stimuli. Impairments of executive functions, or executive dysfunctions, have a growing impact on everyday life and academic achievement and are usually an early feature, and one of the core features, in brain injury and memory and behavioral disorders. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that memory therapeutics cannot achieve their clinical benefits in cognition if executive dysfunction is not effectively and simultaneously treated. Improvement of executive functions might be achieved through targeting some signaling pathways in the brain, including the brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathways. These agents may be useful either as stand-alone interventions for patients with executive dysfunction and/or psychiatric and memory disorders or as essential adjuncts to drugs that target the underlying pathology in various brain injury and memory and behavioral disorders.",

The peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) after a single amount of alcohol is reached 30-45 minutes after ingestion, depending on the rate of absorption and whether food has been taken. Alcohol is a pharmacological intoxicant that suppresses the brain and the rest of the central nervous system. Alcohol interferes with the ability to form new memories, particularly when it is taken in intoxicating amounts. Mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced memory impairments include disruption of neurotransmission in the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a central role in the formation of new memories. A common consequence of clinically significant alcohol intoxication is memory loss for events that occurred while the person was intoxicated—a form of anterograde amnesia.",

      "title": "Anesthetics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anesthesia, which constitutes a state in which noxious events such as surgical procedures are imperceptible, may or may not be accompanied by loss of consciousness. A complete or general anesthetic given by the inhalation or intravenous routes produces hypnosis (profound sleep), analgesia, muscle relaxation, and protection against the increase in blood pressure and heart rate resulting from surgical stress (maintains homeostasis). An anesthetic which blocks the neural transmission of painful stimuli through afferent nerves and does not affect the level of consciousness can be classified as a local anesthetic. Induction of general anesthesia produces a progressive deepening of the anesthetic state and represents a descending desensitization of the central nervous system (CNS). A progression of clinical signs useful for estimating the depth of anesthesia. Four stages can be defined: first, a state of altered consciousness and analgesia begin; second, loss of consciousness, accompanied by irregular respiration and motor movement from depression of higher motor inhibitory centers with release of lower motor mechanisms, occurs; third, surgical anesthesia is reached, in which spinal cord and spinal reflexes are abolished, providing relaxation of skeletal musculature, and loss of corneal, conjunctival, pharyngeal, and laryngeal reflexes occurs progressively; fourth, onset of respiratory paralysis resulting from significant depression of the medullary respiratory center occurs, and subsequent cardiovascular collapse ensues. Monitoring via an electroencephalogram (EEG) and hemodynamic and blood gas monitoring help assess the depth of anesthesia. The potency of inhaled agents is expressed as the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) that is required to prevent spontaneous movement in response to a surgical or equivalent stimulus in 50% of patients. The onset of action is fast (within 60 s) for the intravenous anesthetic agents and somewhat slower for inhalation and local anesthetics. Although the modern practice of anesthesia is exceedingly sophisticated, identification of the basic molecular mechanism underlying it is still lacking. Inhalational anesthetics are very diverse chemically and extrapolation from the effect of a particular agent to the physiological state of anesthesia is problematic. Anesthesia theories may be divided into two categories: lipid theories and protein theories. Lipid theory postulates that inhalational anesthetics exert their primary effects by dissolving in the lipid portions of nerves, altering the conductivity. In protein theories, the direct interaction of inhalation anesthetics and proteins has been proposed as the cause of anesthesia. All inhalation anesthetics agents introduced after 1950, except ethyl vinyl ether, contain fluorine. Agents such as ether, chloroform, trichloroethylene (Trilene), cyclopropane, and fluoroxene (Fluoromar), which were once used, have been displaced by the newer fluorinated anesthetics. The intravenous (iv) anesthetic agents are of two types: those which are used to induce, but not maintain, anesthesia, and those useful for induction and also maintenance. The need is for an anesthetic agent having an extremely fast rate of onset and limited side effects. Fast onset minimizes the stress and agitation. Among the various classes of compounds that have been used are barbiturates, opioids, steroids, benzodiazepines, and hindered phenols. Balanced anesthesia, a potent opioid combined with an inhalation agent, is often used. The inhalational agents probably exert their biological activity through physical effects, while function through a biological receptor‐mediated pathway. At the end of a surgery, the primary concern is to eliminate respiratory depressant effects. This reversal can also diminish analgesic effects. There are two types of reversal agents: pure antagonists and mixed agonist–antagonists. The antagonists naloxone and naltrexone are the most commonly used. Local anesthetics act by inhibiting the channel opening allowing influx of sodium ions. The degree of blockage depends not only on the amount of drug, but also on the rate of nerve stimulation. In the clinically useful agents the polar group is an ester or an amide, although activity may be maintained when the polar function is an ether, thioether, ketone, or thioester. The ideal agent should have a short onset of nesthesia and be useful for multiple indications.",

These remote effects result from deafferentation, a phenomenon known as \"diaschisis\". After an interval of time, which will vary directly with the severity of the lesion, functional recovery occurs due to synaptic reactivation of neurones. This is favourably influenced by rehabilitation. Diaschisis most commonly manifests itself by such neurological signs as impaired consciousness or cognitive impairments including dementia, dyspraxias, dystaxias, dysphasias, incoordination and sensory neglect. The nature of diaschisis has been demonstrated by widespread depressions of local cerebral blood flow and metabolism extending far beyond the anatomical lesion. Recovery of function is associated with recovery of local perfusion and metabolism. [Neurol Res 1993; 15: 362-366]",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement.

Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu.

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

      "title": "The condition of insomnia: Etiopathogenetic considerations and their impact on treatment practices",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.",

Cortical blindness follows bilateral occipital cortex damage, typically vascular. Deficits of verbal, visual and topographical memory become evident early in many dementias. Amnesias are common following a traumatic brain injury. Paramnesias are false or distorted recall – seen in acute confusional states or in dementia. Hallucinations are perceptual experiences without an external sensory stimulus – in other words, people see objects that are not there, hear voices, or believe there is a smell. Breakdown in speech production occurs in many dementias, such as motor neurone disease with dementia. Many find the classification of speech disorders difficult. Language competency depends on a discrete set of abilities: sensory decoding of the spoken message, appreciation of meaning, the capacity for repetition, and production of correctly articulated and correct speech.",

      "title": "Long-term psychiatric disorders after traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "Summary In the long term after traumatic brain injury, the most disabling problems are generally related to neuropsychiatric sequelae, including personality change and cognitive impairment, rather than neurophysical sequelae. Cognitive impairment after severe injury is likely to include impaired speed of information processing, poor memory and executive problems. Personality change may include poor motivation, and a tendency to be self-centred and less aware of the needs of others. Patients may be described as lazy and thoughtless. Some become disinhibited and rude. Agitation and aggression can be very difficult to manage. Anxiety and depression symptoms are quite frequent and play a role in the development of persistent post-concussion syndrome after milder injury. Depression may be associated with a deterioration in disability over time after injury. Psychosis is not unusual though it has been difficult to confirm that traumatic brain injury is a cause of schizophrenia. Head injury may, many years later, increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Good rehabilitation probably minimizes the risk of psychiatric sequelae, but specific psychological and pharmacological treatments may be needed.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "title": "A - 110 Characterization of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Multiple System Atrophy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that primarily impacts movement and balance, as well as the autonomic nervous system. While traditionally not associated with cognitive decline, recent evidence indicates cognitive impairment is part of the disease process, typically manifesting as attentional and executive function deficits, alongside learning/memory impairments. This case contributes to MSA literature by describing mild cognitive changes in a patient with predominant autonomic dysfunction. Method A 68-year-old Caucasian man exhibited progressive cognitive changes over 2–3 years, with concerns emerging 5–10 years prior to neurological consultation (e.g., forgetfulness, word-finding difficulties, decline in ability to follow complex instructions). Predominant sensorimotor/physiological changes included chronic constipation, vasovagal episodes, hearing loss, orthostatic hypotension, transient vision loss, and mild dysphagia. Neuroimaging showed nonspecific mild pontine T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. Significant family history of dementia. Results Evaluation showed mostly normal cognitive function with some decline in executive functioning (slowed processing, reduced problem-solving, set loss, task rigidity) and mild memory decline. Despite scores within normal limits, performance likely reflects cognitive change consistent with his subjective experience, possibly masked by strong cognitive reserve (high educational and occupational attainment, research interests, social engagement). Conclusions Although lacking frank impairment, the patient’s history suggests a neurological process (i.e., synucleinopathy such as MSA) including history of REM sleep behavior disorder, autonomic symptoms/conditions, and neuroimaging findings suggestive of brain stem involvement. Neuropsychological evaluation is critical in differentiating MSA from other Parkinsons’s plus syndromes, as it typically presents with fewer cognitive impairments.",

      "title": "1687 – Social cognition in patients with dissociative amnesia",
      "abstract": "Introduction Dissociative amnesia is triggered by psychological stress or trauma. Its hallmark is a severe (usually retrograde) memory impairment within episodic-autobiographical domain, occurring without evidence of significant brain damage on conventional structural brain imaging. Objectives This work’s objectives are establishing greater recognition of possible relations between memory performance and social cognition in patients with dissociative amnesia. Aims We review data on social cognition (affective and cognitive theory of mind, simulation, empathy, social judgment, moral judgment) from our own patients with dissociative amnesia. Methods Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically and with neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods. Results Patients with dissociative amnesia show variable degrees of impairments of components of social cognition, based on their comorbid conditions (e.g. concurrent clinical or subclinical depression), types of memory impairments (e.g. extent of retrograde amnesia, presence of autobiographical semantic deficits), pattern of brain metabolic changes, personality characteristics, neuropsychological profile (performance on executive functions or emotional processing) and testing paradigms. Conclusions The impairment in dissociative amnesia seems to go beyond the conscious mnemonic deficit, encompassing various aspects of social information processing. Knowledge about the pattern of metabolic and micro-structural brain changes in patients with dissociative amnesia as well as a fine-grained analysis of the neural correlates of various aspects of social cognition might provide an understanding of when and how episodic-autobiographical memory contributes to social cognition. As several studies emphasized, some structures involved in mnemonic processing may also play a role in social perception, cognition and behavioural regulation, including future-minded choice behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Motivation literally means 'to be driven to do something' and refers to processes dealing with the origin and maintenance of the target behavior. Lack of motivation happens to be a core negative symptom of schizophrenia, and it directly influences the functional outcome. Decreased motivation for treatment as well as for other activities and education are common for schizophrenic patients. Motivation can be looked at as a result of complex interaction between physiological processes and the social context factors. The role of underlying physiological processes is not clear so far, and only since recently has attracted the attention of researchers. Clinical data emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation in the cognitive recovery of schizophrenics who have problems with congruence between their behavior and motivating characteristics of the stimulus because of variety of interconnected mechanisms, like anticipation anhedonia, memory laps and problems with long-term memory concerning one's achievements in the past, the disordered mechanism of estimating the value of the task and the effort to accomplish it, and a number of other more complicated reasons.",

A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss.

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "abstract": "Several different dissociable memory systems are considered in terms of their known or putative sites of pathology. In man, short-term memory can be selectively impaired by left hemisphere lesions near the acoustic projection area. There may be other modality-specific deficits. Long-term memory is considered in terms of a) knowledge systems, b) stable associative memory; c) priming, and d) event memory, with special reference to the amnesic syndrome. For each of these categories, clinical neuropathological and relevant animal evidence is reviewed. It is concluded that \"memory\" is not holistic, and the anatomical bases must be considered independently for each of the several dissociable (but normally interacting) systems. Some are likely to involve virtually all levels of the nervous system, while others are highly specific.",

      "title": "Mecanismos neurobiológicos e inmunes que subyacen al déficit en control inhibitorio: estudios preclínicos",
      "abstract": "El deficit de control inhibitorio es un problema social y de salud con un impacto economico sustancial y complejas implicaciones de diagnostico. Las fallas en el control inhibitorio a menudo resultan en consecuencias no deseadas para el individuo, generalmente expresadas en terminos de compulsividad y / o impulsividad. La compulsividad es una caracteristica central en el trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo (TOC) y tambien comorbida en varios trastornos neuropsiquiatricos, como la esquizofrenia, el autismo y la adiccion. Este comportamiento se define como la perseverancia de una respuesta irresistible e inapropiada para el individuo e inevitable a pesar de sus consecuencias negativas. Por otro lado, la impulsividad incluye acciones mal concebidas, prematuramente expresadas, excesivamente arriesgadas o inapropiadas para la situacion, y es un componente clave en todos los trastornos neuropsicopatologicos diferentes, incluido el trastorno por deficit de atencion con hiperactividad (TDAH), el autismo y la esquizofrenia. Sin embargo, ambos constructos tienen un posible significado de diagnostico cruzado, aplicandolos a comorbilidades y puntos en comun en una variedad de trastornos. Estudios preclinicos y clinicos han demostrado la implicacion de los circuitos fronto-estriatal-limbicos en el deficit de control inhibitorio. Especificamente, el receptor serotoninergico 5-HT2A ha demostrado estar implicado en conductas impulsivas y compulsivas. Por lo tanto, el objetivo de la presente tesis fue, primero, estudiar el papel de los receptores 5-HT2A de la corteza prefrontal medial (mPFc) en la bebida compulsiva en la polidipsia inducida por programa (SIP). Para ello, realizamos microinfusiones intra-mPFc de DOI -agonista de 5-HT2A/C-, M100907 -antagonista de 5-HT2A- y SB242084 - antagonista de 5-HT2C-. La activacion de los receptores 5-HT2A/C dentro del mPFc dio como resultado una reduccion de la bebida compulsiva en ratas altas bebedoras (HD) seleccionadas por SIP, efecto que se bloqueo por la administracion conjunta de M100907 pero no de SB242084. Ademas, investigamos si las ratas altas y bajas compulsivas seleccionadas por SIP mostraron diferencias basales en el “binding” del receptor 5-HT2A en estructuras cruciales para el control inhibitorio. Las ratas compulsivas HD menor “binding” en la amigdala basolateral (BLA) en comparacion con las bajas bebedoras (LD) seleccionadas por SIP. La plasticidad cerebral desadaptativa se ha relacionado con el deficit de control inhibitorio, subyacente a las diferencias individuales en cuanto a las conductas impulsivas o compulsivas en sujetos vulnerables. Por lo tanto, investigamos la morfologia de las estructuras cerebrales relacionadas con el control inhibitorio en animales altos y bajos compulsivos. Las ratas HD mostraron una disminucion del volumen del hipocampo y un aumento del volumen de BLA despues de la reexposicion SIP, comparadas con las HD no reexpuestas y la LD reexpuestas. La activacion inmune se ha propuesto como un factor crucial implicado en la vulnerabilidad al deficit de control inhibitorio gracias a su estudio con modelos preclinicos. En el presente trabajo expusimos a los animales a Lipopolisacarido (LPS) y a antigeno de estreptococo del Grupo A (GAS) en etapas tempranas con el fin de estudiar con tareas conductuales especificas sus posibles efectos a largo plazo en relacion con el deficit de control inhibitorio. Ademas, exploramos si esta vulnerabilidad podria ser dinamitada por el estres y/o paliada por el tratamiento con antibiotico. Tambien evaluamos los efectos en biomarcadores inmunes cerebrales, como la interleucina-6 (IL-6), la interleucina-17 (IL-17) y el factor de necrosis tumoral α (TNFα). La exposicion a LPS aumento la compulsividad mediante respuestas perseverativas en “5-choice serial reaction time task” (5-CSRT task). La exposicion a GAS incremento el comportamiento impulsivo por respuestas prematuras en la tarea 5-CSRT en condiciones basales, y tanto la exposicion a GAS como la administracion del antibiotico ampicilina incrementaron el comportamiento impulsivo despues de aumentar el intervalo entre ensayos (ITI) de 5 a 7s. Por otra parte, la exposicion a GAS incremento la toma de decisiones impulsivas en “delay-discounting task”, efecto que fue revertido delay=20s por el tratamiento antibiotico. La exposicion a GAS disminuyo los niveles de IL-6 y aumento los niveles de TNFα en NAcc, y mostro un efecto combinado cuando se administro con el antibiotico disminuyendo los niveles de IL-17 en PFc. Hubo una correlacion positiva entre los niveles de TNFα en NAcc y en PFc con ambas medidas de impulsividad. La presente tesis refuerza la idea de la implicacion de los receptores 5-HT2A en el deficit de control inhibitorio; especificamente, su activacion dentro de mPFc redujo la compulsividad en ratas HD en SIP. Se reportan alteraciones morfologicas en hipocampo y amigdala en ratas compulsivas seleccionadas por SIP, apuntando asi a cambios en la plasticidad cerebral como mecanismos subyacentes en trastornos psicopatologicos impulsivos-compulsivos. Ademas, la presente tesis muestra un papel putativo de la activacion inmune como factor de vulnerabilidad al deficit de control inhibitorio a largo plazo.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a cognitive process that disrupts consciousness, identity, or memory. It is frequently used as a form of defense in response to significant stress or trauma. In serious situations, it might show as a dissociative disorder, which extremely impairs psychological functioning. Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Depressive Storungen konnen neben den Erstrangsymptomen „depressive Stimmung“, „Verlust von Interesse oder Freude“ und „erhohte Ermudbarkeit“ mit einer grosen Anzahl an weiteren Symptomen einhergehen. Folgende kognitive Defizite sind kennzeichnend: Storungen der kognitiven Flexibilitat, des Arbeitsgedachtnisses, des freien Abrufs von Gedachtnisinhalten, der geteilten Aufmerksamkeit und von Teilbereichen der selektiven Aufmerksamkeit.\nDie Bundesanstalt fur Strasenwesen (BASt) und wissenschaftliche Forschungsarbeiten konnten eine Reihe an Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen identifizieren, welche eine ausreichende psychische Leistungsfahigkeit im Strasenverkehr gewahrleisten sollen. Obwohl sich die hierbei hervorgehobenen kognitiven Leistungsfunktionen nahezu umfassend mit den Defizitbereichen bei depressiven Storungen uberschneiden und bisher kein rein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen der Schwere der depressiven Symptomatik und dem Auspragungsgrad kognitiver Beeintrachtigungen gefunden werden konnte, besagt die aktuelle Rechtslage, dass lediglich bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung anzuzweifeln sei.\nZiele der vorliegenden Arbeit: Zum einen sollte uberpruft werden, ob sich die in der Literatur berichteten Unterschiede zwischen depressiven Patienten und gesunden Vergleichspersonen in der kognitiven Leistungsfahigkeit, bei der Fahrkompetenz, bei der Selbstbeschreibung und im Risikoverhalten finden lassen. Zum anderen wurde zu bestimmen versucht, welche dieser Mase hauptverantwortlich fur Unterschiede in der Fahrkompetenz sind.\nMethode: Hierzu bearbeitete eine Gruppe stationar-psychiatrischer Patienten mit unipolarer Depression jeweils unmittelbar nach stationarer Aufnahme und bei Entlassung (neuro-) psychologische Testverfahren. Daruber hinaus wurde zeitnah zu den Testungen eine praktische Fahrerprobung in einem Fahrschulauto durchgefuhrt. Ein dritter Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, die wissenschaftliche Gute dieser praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe zu uberprufen. Alle Untersuchungen wurden parallel auch mit einer Kontrollgruppe korperlich und psychisch gesunder Probanden durchgefuhrt. \nErgebnisse: Die Fahrverhaltensprobe konnte strenge wissenschaftliche und verkehrspsychologische Anforderungen erfullen. Es zeigte sich, dass sich die Patienten neben dem Ausmas ihrer subjektiven und objektiven Depressivitat, auch in einer Reihe von Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen von den Kontrollpersonen unterschieden. Es liesen sich sowohl einzelne wie auch Kombinationen an Variablen identifizieren, die bereits fur die eher geringe Stichprobengrose der Studie die Fahrkompetenz der Probanden mit einem zufrieden stellenden Mas an Sensitivitat und Spezifitat vorhersagten. \nDiskussion: Mit dieser Arbeit wurde erstmals bei Patienten mit mittelschwerer Depression sowohl anhand neuropsychologischer Testverfahren als auch mit Hilfe einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe untersucht, welche Auswirkungen deren Erkrankung auf die Fahrkompetenz hat. Vorangegangene Studien konnten aber bereits die Annahme der BASt, dass nur bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung fraglich sei, deutlich in Frage stellen. Die vorliegende Studie stutzt die bisherigen Erkenntnisse und zeigt zusatzlich auf, dass auch bei einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe, die den Anforderungen der BASt entspricht, nicht von vergleichbaren Leistungen bei depressiven Patienten und gesunden Kontrollen auszugehen ist. Die geringe Stichprobengrose lasst allerdings eine Generalisierung der Ergebnisse nicht zu. Weitere Forschungsarbeit in dieser Richtung ist erforderlich.",

It is often precipitated by particularly strenuous activity, high-stress events, or coitus, but it can be seen with migraines as well. Studies have been inconclusive as to whether there are risk factors for the development of TGA, though some have suggested an association with a history of prior heart disease, migraine, or hyperlipidemia. Patients will often present with repetitive questioning and total anterograde memory loss that resolves within 24 hours. While there is disorientation with respect to other people and location, the patients will not lose self-awareness. The symptoms, once resolved, rarely recur and no other neurological deficits present with this condition. The diagnosis is largely a diagnosis of exclusion.",

      "title": "Primera convulsión en apirexia",
      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC. Sin embargo, en la mayor parte de los casos las crisis no provocadas se presentan en ninos en los cuales no LOS EXPERTOS RESPONDEN Arch Pediatr Urug 2002; 73(4): 233-235",

Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW.

Initial assessment of neuropsychological functions 3 months after the psychological trauma indicated severe memory deficits for acquiring new information in both verbal and visual modalities with widespread cognitive deficits in attention, executive functions, and intellectual ability. Importantly, working and remote memory were intact. The case illustrates that psychogenic anterograde amnesia might be associated with a wider range of cognitive deficits. Possible neurobiological explanations are discussed to explain large cognitive impairments associated with anterograde psychogenic amnesia.",

Disturbances in intrapsychic function can have an organic basis, and errors in differential diagnosis can result when therapists do not consider intrapsychic and organic damage in combination. Brain-injured individuals need others who are comfortable providing auxiliary functions, particularly as an aid in managing anxiety. Understanding the operation of anxiety after brain injury can further the capacity of these individuals to attain and maintain more gratifying interpersonal relationships.",

Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

      "title": "Perioperative Management of Acute Central Nervous System Injury",
      "abstract": "Neural function is essential to human existence. Thus, loss of any neural element in the course of a critical illness represents a major loss to a given individual. Neurons or supporting elements may be lost in a small, virtually unnoticeable manner, perhaps manifest as cognitive or behavioral deficit, or there may be widespread selective neuronal loss or tissue infarction with more apparent and disabling deficits. Based on the notion that neural function is the essence of acceptable survival from critical illness, it is crucial for perioperative management to include considerations of neural viability and the impact and interactions of the primary diseases and therapeutics on the nervous system. There are numerous perioperative scenarios where a patient may present with neurologic dysfunction. In a general sense, these scenarios often involve ischemia, trauma, or neuroexcitation. Each of these, as they progressively worsen, at some point typically involve a period of decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), usually resulting from elevated intracranial pressure, eventually compromising cerebral blood flow sufficiently to produce permanent neuronal loss, infarction, and possibly brain death. A variety of biochemical pathways play a major role. Optimization of perioperative outcome after injury to the central nervous system (CNS) is a multifactorial process requiring skillful and well-informed anesthetic and critical care management. However, none of these interventions is risk-free, and extensive knowledge and expertise are very important to ensure a fine balance between the benefits and risks of specific interventions. By the end of this chapter, the anesthesia provider should have a general understanding of how to address the most commonly encountered complications in the acutely injured central nervous system.",

      "title": "Early identification and intervention for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

      "title": "Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: What We Know Now",
      "abstract": "Small delays in onset of Alzheimer's Disease are predicted to reduce its global burden, but we need to better understand factors that increase the risk-and methods to reduce it. The clinical syndrome of dementia refers to a pattern of cognitive deficits characterized by impairment in memory and at least one other cognitive domain (e.g., language, executive functions, visuospatial abilities) that is sufficiently severe to impact behavior and interfere with social or occupational functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Dementia may be progressive, static, or remitting, and its onset and course of symptoms are a function of underlying neuropathology from various causes. For example, dementia because of a neurodegenerative process tends to involve an insidious onset with gradual progressive cognitive impairment. In contrast, dementia from vascular or acquired brain injury tends to involve an abrupt onset of clinical symptoms that may remain static or show stepwise cognitive decline that corresponds to episodes of cerebrovascular accidents. The most common causes of dementia are neuropathologically distinguished on the basis of the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease); multiple or strategically placed infarctions, ischemic injury, or hemorrhagic lesions (e.g., vascular dementia); cell loss and the deposition of Lewy bodies in sub-cortical, limbic, and neocortical regions (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies); and prominent frontal and temporal lobar atrophy (frontotemporal dementia). Dementia can also be found in the context of other neurological, infectious, or metabolic conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, human immunodeficiency virus, or traumatic brain injury. Despite recent advances in amyloid imaging and cerebral spinal fluid analysis, neuropathological changes are often only accurately assessed at autopsy. This makes definitive diagnosis during an individual's lifetime difficult. Effectively differentiating between forms of dementia or normal aging requires reliance on the neuropsychological definition of a specific pattern of cognitive deficits. Epidemiology and Neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's Disease is the leading cause of dementia in elders and accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of all dementia cases. An estimated 5.3 million Americans have Alzheimer's Disease. Reports indicate the disease is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and deaths because of Alzheimer's Disease are on the rise, with an increase of 46 percent between 2000 and 2006. Given the advancing age of the baby boom generation, by 2050, 14 million older Americans and 81 million adults worldwide are expected to have the disease (Alzheimer's Association, 2010a). Alzheimer's Disease is an age-related degenerative brain disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular fibrillar amyloid deposits and intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These characteristics lead to neuronal atrophy and synapse loss in medial temporal lobe limbic structures that are critical for episodic memory and extend to the association cortices of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes with disease progression (Braak and Braak, 1991). Consistent with these widespread neuropathological changes, the primary clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive global dementia syndrome that usually begins in later life. It is generally agreed that the pathological cascade of brain changes occurs gradually in Alzheimer's Disease, beginning with the very early accrual of Aβ plaques in the brain, and is followed by a variable lag time after which neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the leading pathological process (Jack et al., 2010). Although Aβ neuropathology is thought to be causal, clinical symptoms are more closely related to neurofibrillary tangles than amyloid deposition. …",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

It may mean a pain, severe or slight, of a \"neuralgic character.<sup>1</sup>' It is often applied to irregular functional disturbances, as for example, the gastro-intestinal functions, which may be perfect to-day, less so to-morrow, violently disturbed the next day, and normal the fourth, without any assignable cause. Neurosis may mean emotional manifestations, for example, irritability of temper, explosions of unprovoked grief, attacks of epileptiform convulsions, such psychic disturbances as melancholia and maniacal conditions. Ecstasy, delirium, hallucinations and trance have been called by that convenient term. It is often applied to that indefinite symptom-complex, known as neurasthenia, or more popularly called hysteria. In short, no matter what the train of symptoms may have been, when it seemed impossible to find structural changes due to inflammatory processes, acute or chronic, or when it could not be shown that",

The onset and severity of terminal decline vary greatly between individuals. It is thought that a certain degree of cognitive decline occurs due to biological changes in the aging human brain, but evidence suggests that more abrupt and perceptible decline is often associated with an underlying death process or disease pathology. Decline is often gradual and relatively imperceptible for a period of several years, then increases dramatically in closer proximity to death. Future investigations are necessary to characterize disease‐specific decline trajectories and understand how specific areas of cognition (i.e., memory, vocabulary) are affected by terminal decline.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "abstract": "Common psychiatric problems in cancer patients include depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and delirium. Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

      "abstract": "Organic amnesia is a selective impairment of memory that occurs as a consequence of various types of brain damage. Although amnesic patients typically have severe difficulties remembering recent events and acquiring new information, it has been demonstrated that some of their learning abilities are spared. Amnesic patients can retain and express some aspects of a learning experience, despite their inability to recollect the experience in a conscious or explicit manner. This phenomenon is referred to as an implicit expression of memory. The present article considers whether amnesic patients show implicit memory for new facts and associations. Three relevant kinds of evidence are considered: source amnesia, priming effects, and learning of computer vocabulary and commands. It is concluded that (a) amnesic patients do show some implicit memory for new facts and associations, and (b) this type of memory is not entirely spared. Implications for multiple memory system views of amnesia are discussed.",

The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation. The most important aspect consider about the role of psychotic symptoms in diagnostic formulation is the impact on the patient.",

      "abstract": "Inherited metabolic disorders can cause onset of epilepsy in the first year of life. Epilepsy rarely dominates the clinical presentation, which is more frequently associated with other neurologic symptoms, such as mental retardation, hypotonia and/or dystonia, or vigilance disturbances. The pathogenesis of seizures is multifaceted; inherited metabolic disorder can affect the balance between excitatory and inhibitory chemical mediators, eliminate an energetic substrate at the cerebral level, cause in utero brain malformation, or provoke acute brain lesions. Some clinical disorders that strongly suggest particular metabolic etiologies can be identified. For example, specific clinical signs and findings on electroencephalogram (EEG) are characteristic of pyridoxine-dependent seizures, and inherited metabolic disorders associated with early myoclonic encephalopathy are well defined. In most cases, however, epilepsy secondary to inherited metabolic disorders presents with polymorphic clinical and EEG features that are difficult to classify into precise epileptic syndromes. Common characteristics of these seizures include onset in the first months of life; usually partial, multifocal; simple partial motor semiology; successive appearance of tonic seizures, spasms, and massive myoclonus; and resistance to antiepilepsy drugs. Inherited metabolic disorders must be considered in patients presenting with epilepsy and progressive neurologic worsening.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe, chronic, and recurring mental disorder, which is frequently accompanied by co-occurring mental and somatic illnesses. Compelling evidence indicates that patients with MDD exhibit cognitive impairment encompassing several domains, including but not limited to, executive function, verbal memory, and attention. In addition, cognitive impairment may be evident even during remission and appears to play a major role in the persistence of psychosocial dysfunction (including impairment in workforce). Therefore, several compounds have been tested as putative cognitive enhancers for MDD. Although antidepressant treatment may be associated with modest improvements in some cognitive domains (namely psychomotor speed and delayed recall), evidence thus far remains unclear owing to methodological limitations across clinical trials. These methodological limitations include: (i) lack of adequate screening for cognitive dysfunction at baseline; (ii) the inclusion of samples that were not in remission at baseline; pseudospecificity (i.e. observed effects on cognition could be due to secondary improvement in mood); (iii) cognitive function was not the primary outcome in some trials; and (iv) lack of standardization of cognitive measures employed across studies. Replicated evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that vortioxetine and duloxetine may have procognitive effects. Furthermore, data from RCTs suggest that lisdexamfetamine, modafinil, metformin, and erythropoietin may also have beneficial cognitive effects. In conclusion, the achievement of cognitive remission remains an unmet goal in the treatment of MDD. Future research directions, including methodological improvements in the conduct of RCTs targeting MDD-related cognitive dysfunction, are discussed.",

In the majority of patients receiving palliative care, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial. The most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation. Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue.

The mental instability manifests itself in inadequate changes of inner life considering the goals, compliance with external influence, relaxation of self-control. People with a weak nervous system are more susceptible to the negative influences of stressful situations. The core of psyche is a reflection. The psyche is a subjective image of the objective world, an ideal (immaterial) reflection of the reality. The psychological firmness of the law enforcement employees affects the overall efficient exposure of crimes.",

      "abstract": "Neurological assessment of critically ill patients requires physical examination although coexisting cognitive impairment, sedative or paralytic medication, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular weakness, injuries or surgery involving extracranial tissues may limit sensitivity and specificity of findings. Notwithstanding these constraints, neurological signs and syndromes are valuable indicators of severity of illness and prognosis. Common neurologic syndromes in ICU patients include disturbances in the level of arousal and in cognition, delirium, seizures, generalized weakness, and focal neurological deficits. Whenever possible, neurological examination should include an assessment of mental status, attention, cranial nerves, motor and sensory findings. If there is persisting diagnostic uncertainty additional testing should be sought. Computed tomography of the head should be obtained whenever there is a new onset of seizures, focal neurologic deficits, alteration of mental status or loss of consciousness which are not immediately reversible or explainable. Magnetic resonance imaging has greater sensitivity for demyelinating and inflammatory diseases, hyperacute ischemic stroke, microhemorrhagic lesions, anoxic-ischemic damage, and disorders affecting the white matter and the brainstem. Electroencephalography is needed if seizures or status epilepticus are suspected as a cause or consequence of acute brain dysfunction. Somatosensory evoked potentials, best studied in patients with anoxic brain injury may help with prognostication following cardiac arrest. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocities should be obtained when neuromuscular weakness is severe or cannot be assessed clinically.",

      "title": "Dementia: mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. In most individuals, the symptoms of the disease begin with mild memory difficulties after the sixth decade of life. Symptoms progress slowly, leading to significant impairment in memory, language, executive function, and other domains of cognition. Eventually, impaired cognitive abilities interfere with complex activities of daily life and ultimately result in the loss of independent function. The diagnosis is typically made in this context on the basis of clinical evidence of dementia with progressive impairment in multiple domains of cognition. Structural neuroimaging is often used in the clinical setting to evaluate for the presence of other pathologies (e.g. cerebrovascular or neoplastic disease). Functional neuroimaging, such as PET or SPECT, may be employed clinically to assist in the discrimination of different types of dementia (e.g. frontotemporal vs. Alzheimer’s dementia). Current treatments are primarily symptomatic, in that clinical trials demonstrate short-term stabilization of cognitive function but not a slowing of the rate of decline. Increasing emphasis is being placed on the development of disease-modifying therapies — drugs that impede the underlying pathophysiologic process of neurodegeneration in AD and, thereby, slow the rate of cognitive decline.",

In neurophysiological terms, pain is experienced when selected areas in the limbic system, particularly neurones in the cingulate gyrus and related areas of the somatosensory cortex are excited at the same time . Physiologically, this condition arises when nociceptors in peripheral tissues are stimulated, as is the case following trauma in acute pain or in inflammatory pain (nociceptive pain). However, it is not uncommon that excitation of limbic and related somatosensory cortical neurones originate from abnormal, usually damaged, peripheral or central nervous tissue (neuropathic pain) or as the consequence of psychological mechanisms (psychogenic pain). For the individual it does not matter how the typical state of limbic and somatosensory cortex excitation comes about, because the end result is just as unpleasant.",

Moreover, somatic problems can interfere with a loss of motivation; loss of motivation is frequent with exhausting chronic diseases, cognitive impairment and it facilitates the social withdrawal. In elderly, loss of motivation blunts the intensity of moral pain. Depressions with conative disorders can move in a dysexecutive syndrome. Even if, owing to the treatment, the cognitive disorders disappear, several years after, an authentic dementia can be diagnosed. With aging process, elderly must cope with losses, less or more balanced: affective, physical and financial losses, triggering the reject of any personal commitment. Aging process also concerns brain amines, especially dopamine, exposing old persons to depression. It alters by a similar way others brain neuro-mediator, such acetylcholine, involved in dementia. Both loss motivation and executive disorders have to be systematically assessed. An antidepressant therapeutic is necessary in case of doubt, improving patients thymic status, quality of life of patients and their family, and sometime of frontal dysfunctions.",

      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

Syncopal and psychomotor attacks may overlap in the following context: falls resembling syncope during psychomotor seizures, the so-called \"temporal fainting spells\"; cardiac arrhythmias during psychomotor attacks; psychomotor symptoms such as automatisms and/or \"dreamy states\" that occur during syncopal attacks with transient dysfunction of the limbic system; alternating psychomotor and syncopal attacks in the same patient Symptoms of intermittent vertebrobasilar insufficiency: non-systematic vertigo, brief blurring of consciousness and blackouts may all be misinterpreted as rudimentary psychomotor seizures.

Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

      "abstract": "The integrity of time consciousness is the condition of possibility of the identity through time of an object of perception as well as of the person who perceives it. I will present our findings about abnormal time experience (ATE) in people with schizophrenia. These data may support the following hypothesis: if the continuity of temporal experience disintegrates (of which ATE are experiential manifestations), overarching meaningful units are no longer available, thereby creating temporal gaps, e.g., in one's stream of consciousness. In some cases, thoughts that are no longer experienced as embedded in one's stream of thoughts are experienced as, e.g., thought interferences, blockages, insertion or withdrawal. These symptoms cannot be explained as a mere disturbance of attention or comprehension at the level of semantic combinations. Rather, the disturbance could be searched for at a more basic level where the temporal coherence of conscious awareness is constituted. A failure of the constitutive temporal synthesis may create micro-gaps of conscious experience. In the most severe cases, thoughts or other mental phenomena that are no longer embedded in the continuity of basic self-experience may appear in consciousness as “erratic blocks” and experienced as being inserted, or, if further externalized, as auditory hallucinations (“voices”). This coheres with the hypothesis that a breakdown of temporality may be bound up with the breakdown of prereflexive self-awareness.

      "abstract": "The commonest and simplest operational definition of consciousness is, the state of the patient’s awareness of self and environment and his responsiveness to external stimulation and inner need. Therefore, unconsciousness has the opposite meaning, that is, a state of unawareness of self and environment or a suspension of those mental activities by which people are made aware of themselves and their environment, coupled with a diminished responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness can have many different causes, for example, stroke, traumatic brain injury, anesthesia, brainstem lesions and sleep, the various causes of unconsciousness primarily interfering with different brain functions. Clinically, impaired consciousness such as coma, vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) is a very common manifestation in subjects with acquired brain injury. Unconsciousness does not always consist of a general suppression of the entire activity of the central nervous system. Depending on the actual cause(s), many functions, such as protective reflexes and various cognitive processes, can remain intact. The Management of such a patient in VS or MCS requires carefully reaching the correct diagnosis, pronouncing an evidence-based prognosis, and thoughtfully considering the medical, ethical, and legal elements of optimum treatment (Bernat, 2006).",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

      "title": "Disautonomia: Uma Condição Esquecida – Parte 1",
      "abstract": "Dysautonomia covers a range of clinical conditions with different characteristics and prognoses. They are classified as Reflex Syndromes, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH) and Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity Syndrome. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes will not be discussed in this article. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes are mostly benign and usually occur in patients without an intrinsic autonomic nervous system (ANS) or heart disease. Therefore, they are usually studied separately. Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) is the term most currently used to define dysautonomia with impairment of the sympathetic and/or parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic nervous system. It can be idiopathic, such as multisystemic atrophy or pure autonomic failure, or secondary to systemic pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease, dementia syndromes, chronic renal failure, amyloidosis and it may also occur in the elderly. The presence of Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) implies greater severity and worse prognosis in various clinical situations. Detection of Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) is a late sign and means greater severity in the context of dysautonomia, defined as Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH). It must be differentiated from hypotension due to hypovolemia or medications, called non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nnOH). OH can result from benign causes, such as acute, chronic hypovolemia or use of various drugs. However, these drugs may only reveal subclinical pictures of Dysautonomia. All drugs of patients with dysautonomic conditions should be reevaluated. Precise diagnosis of CAN and the investigation of the involvement of other organs or systems is extremely important in the clinical suspicion of pandysautonomia. In diabetics, in addition to age and time of disease, other factors are associated with a higher incidence of CAN, such poor glycemic control, hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity. Among diabetic patients, 38-44% can develop Dysautonomia, with prognostic implications and higher cardiovascular mortality. In the initial stages of DM, autonomic dysfunction involves the parasympathetic system, then the sympathetic system and, later on, it presents as orthostatic hypotension. Valsalva, Respiratory and Orthostatic tests (30:15) are the gold standard methods for the diagnosis of CAN. They can be associated with RR Variability tests in the time domain, and mainly in the frequency domain, to increase the sensitivity (protocol of the 7 tests). These tests can detect initial or subclinical abnormalities and assess severity and prognosis. The Tilt Test should not be the test of choice for investigating CAN at an early stage, as it detects cases at more advanced stages. Tilt response with a dysautonomic pattern (gradual drop in blood pressure without increasing heart rate) may suggest CAN. Treatment of patients at moderate to advanced stages of dysautonomia is quite complex and often refractory, requiring specialized and multidisciplinary evaluation. There is no cure for most types of Dysautonomia at a late stage. NOH patients can progress with supine hypertension in more than 50% of the cases, representing a major therapeutic challenge. The immediate risk and consequences of OH should take precedence over the later risks of supine hypertension and values greater than 160/90 mmHg are tolerable. Sleeping with the head elevated (20-30 cm), not getting up at night, taking short-acting antihypertensive drugs for more severe cases, such as losartan, captopril, clonidine or nitrate patches, may be necessary and effective in some cases. Preventive measures such as postural care; good hydration; higher salt intake; use of compression stockings and abdominal straps; portioned meals; supervised physical activity, mainly sitting, lying down or exercising in the water are important treatment steps. Various drugs can be used for symptomatic nOH, especially fludrocortisone, midodrine and droxidopa, the latter not available in Brazil. The risk of exacerbation or triggering supine hypertension should be considered. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome represents a form of Dysautonomia and has been renamed as a systemic disease of exercise intolerance, with new diagnostic criteria: 1 - Unexplained fatigue, leading to occupational disability for more than 6 months; 2 - Feeling ill after exercising; 3 - Non-restorative sleep; 4 - One of the following findings: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. Several pathologies today have evolved with chronic fatigue, being called chronic diseases associated with chronic fatigue. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), another form of presentation of dysautonomic syndromes, is characterized by sustained elevation of heart rate (HR) ≥30 bpm (≥40 bpm if <20 years) or HR ≥120 bpm, in the first 10 minutes in an orthostatic position or during the tilt test, without classical orthostatic hypotension associated. A slight decrease in blood pressure may occur. Symptoms appear or get worse in an orthostatic position, with dizziness, weakness, pre-syncope, palpitations, and other systemic symptoms being common.O termo disautonomia abrange um conjunto de condições clínicas com características e prognósticos distintos. Classificam-se em síndromes reflexas, síndrome postural ortostática taquicardizante (SPOT), síndrome da fadiga crônica, Hipotensão Ortostática Neurogênica (HON) e a Síndrome da hipersensibilidade do seio carotídeo. As síndromes reflexas (vasovagal) não serão discutidas neste artigo. As síndromes reflexas (vasovagal) são, na maioria das vezes, benignas, e ocorrem usualmente em pacientes sem doença intrínseca do sistema nervoso autônomo (SNA) ou do coração. Por isso, geralmente são estudadas separadamente. O termo neuropatia autonômica cardiovascular (NAC) é o mais utilizado na atualidade para definir as disautonomias com comprometimento do sistema nervoso autônomo cardiovascular simpático e/ou parassimpático. Pode ser idiopática, como a atrofia multissistêmica ou a falência autonômica pura, ou secundária a patologias sistêmicas como diabetes mellitus, doenças neurodegenerativas, doença de Parkinson, síndromes demenciais, insuficiência renal crônica, amiloidose, podendo também acometer idosos. A presença de neuropatia autonômica cardiovascular (NAC) implica em maior gravidade e pior prognóstico em diversas situações clínicas. A detecção de hipotensão ortostática (HO) é um sinal tardio e significa maior gravidade no contexto das disautonomias, definida como hipotensão ortostática neurogênica (HON). Deve ser diferenciada das hipotensões por hipovolemia ou medicamentosas, chamadas de hipotensão ortostática não neurogênica (HONN). A HO pode decorrer de causas benignas, como a hipovolemia aguda, crônica, ou ao uso de diversos fármacos. Esses fármacos podem, entretanto, apenas desmascarar quadros subclínicos de disautonomia. Deve-se reavaliar todos os fármacos de pacientes com quadros disautonômicos. O diagnóstico preciso de NAC e a investigação do envolvimento de outros órgãos ou sistemas é de extrema importância na suspeita clínica de uma pandisautonomia. No diabético, além da idade e do tempo de doença, outros fatores estão associados a maior ocorrência de NAC, como descontrole glicêmico, hipertensão, dislipidemia e obesidade. Entre os pacientes diabéticos, 38–44% podem evoluir com disautonomia, com implicações prognósticas e maior mortalidade cardiovascular. Nas etapas iniciais da DM, a disfunção autonômica envolve o sistema parassimpático, posteriormente o simpático e mais tardiamente manifesta-se com hipotensão ortostática. Os testes de Valsalva, respiratório e ortostático (30:15) são os métodos de padrão ouro para o diagnóstico de NAC. Eles podem ser associados aos testes de variabilidade RR no domínio do tempo, e principalmente da frequência, para aumento da sensibilidade (protocolo dos 7 testes). Esses testes podem detectar alterações iniciais ou subclínicas e avaliar a gravidade e o prognóstico. O teste de inclinação (tilt test) não deve ser o exame de escolha para investigação de NAC em fase inicial, pois detecta casos em fases mais avançadas. A resposta no tilt com padrão disautonômico (queda gradativa da pressão arterial sem aumento da frequência cardíaca) pode sugerir NAC. O tratamento dos pacientes em fases moderadas a avançadas das disautonomias é bastante complexo e muitas vezes refratário, necessitando de avaliação especializada e multidisciplinar. Não há cura para a maioria das disautonomias em fase tardia. Os pacientes com HON podem evoluir com hipertensão supina em mais de 50% dos casos, representando um grande desafio terapêutico. O risco imediato e as consequências da HO devem ter preferência sobre os riscos mais tardios da hipertensão supina e valores maiores que 160/90 mmHg são toleráveis. Medidas como dormir com a cabeceira elevada (20–30 cm), não levantar à noite, uso de anti-hipertensivo de ação curta noturna para casos mais severos, como a losartana, captopril, clonidina ou adesivos de nitratos, podem ser necessários e efetivos em alguns casos. As medidas preventivas como cuidados posturais, boa hidratação, maior ingesta de sal, uso de meias e cintas abdominais compressoras, refeições fracionadas, atividade física supervisionada principalmente sentada, deitada ou exercícios na água são etapas importantes no tratamento. Diversos fármacos podem ser usados para HON sintomática, principalmente a fludrocortisona, a midodrina e a droxidopa. Esses últimas não estão disponíveis no Brasil. O risco de exacerbação ou desencadeamento de hipertensão supina deve ser considerado. A síndrome da fadiga crônica representa uma forma de disautonomia e tem sido renomeada como doença sistêmica de intolerância ao exercício, com novos critérios diagnósticos: 1 - Fadiga inexplicada, levando a incapacidade para o trabalho por mais que 6 meses; 2 - Mal-estar após exercício; 3 - Sono não reparador; 4 - Mais um dos seguintes achados: comprometimento cognitivo ou intolerância ortostática. Várias patologias na atualidade têm evoluído com fadiga crônica, sendo denominadas de doenças crônicas associadas a fadiga crônica. A síndrome postural ortostática taquicardizante (SPOT), outra forma de apresentação das síndromes disautonômicas, é caracterizada por elevação sustentada da frequência cardíaca (FC) ≥30 bpm (≥40 bpm se <20 anos) ou FC ≥120 bpm, nos primeiros 10 minutos em posição ortostática ou durante o tilt test, sem hipotensão ortostática clássica associada. Pode ocorrer leve redução na pressão arterial. Os sintomas manifestam-se ou pioram em posição ortostática, sendo comuns a tontura, fraqueza, pré-síncope, palpitações, além de outros sintomas sistêmicos.",

In clinical practice it is important to distinguish between idiopathic chronic fatigue (primary or functional asthenia) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Fatigue can also be classified by neuromuscular and/or cognitive and mental fatigue. The article discusses the neuroanatomical basis and focuses on the neurocognitive theory of pathological fatigue. In addition the relationship between mental stress, fatigue and cognitive impairments such as subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are also discussed. We discuss the rationale that for treatment of asthenic conditions accompanied by cognitive dysfunction it is justified to use combination therapy - fonturacetam and a preparation containing nicotinoyl-GABA and Ginkgo Biloba.Астенические состояния характеризуются повышенной утомляемостью, нарушением повседневного функционирования и снижением работоспособности.

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

      "abstract": "With rare exceptions, clinical pain is a neurological phenomenon known universally to human patients. Pain becomes chronic only when this unpleasant sensory and emotional experience persists for much longer than expected relative to the severity or duration of the initial noxious stimulus. The regions of symptom onset, patterns of radiation or referral to other body sites, and any association with loss or excess of somatic sensation within the symptomatic regions have major relevance in the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. In patients who suffer from multiple pain types or regions, or in whom there coexists abnormal perception of different modes of sensory stimulation, documenting clinical data using only verbal descriptors can be overwhelming. Historically, large portions of the autonomic nervous system have been thought of as only being responsible for the creation of involuntary physiological responses to acute, stressful or noxious stimuli.",

There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population.

Most people experience mood changes at some time, but those related to bipolar disorder are more intense than regular mood changes, and other symptoms can occur. Some people experience psychosis, which can include delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia. Objectives Through this research we aimed to identify all the special features of bipolar depression which will help the clinical psychiatrists in easier diagnosis and management of the disorder. Methods Literature review (PubMed) Results Clinical Characteristics in Favour of Bipolarity in Depression: psychomotor retardation, history of psychotic depression,history of psychotic depression shortly after giving childbirth, frequent catatonic symptoms, atypical depressive features, severe impairment in interpersonal relationships, inconsistency in business life, history of hypomania, mania or mixed episode,common feeling of numbness and anhedonia; less common sadness and feelings of guilt, mood instability, volatility in temperament, frequent change in affect, daydreaming during the episode and daily life, short duration of depression &lt;3 months, poor cognitive functions during depressive episode, generally similar symptom severity during the day and night etc. Conclusions This leads to misdiagnosis of bipolar depression as unipolar depression, which in turn leads to delayed correct diagnosis and treatment and may severely affect the patient’s entire life.

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

Lesions affecting primary sensorimotor cortices result in primary sensorimotor deficits that are qualitatively all-or-nothing, such as blindness (hemianopia) and paralysis (hemiparesis). Quantitatively, though, the severity of the deficit depends on the extent of the lesion (so that a hemiparetic patient may not be completely paralyzed but simply weak). Lesions affecting modality-specific association regions result in conceptually more complex disorders that are confined to a single modality, such as nonfluent aphasia (a form of motor speech disorder reflecting the language-dominant hemisphere) or prosopagnosia (a visual disorder impairing the ability to disambiguate visually similar entities, specifically faces, reflecting the “what” visual pathway in inferotemporal cortices).",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

Storage of the information acquired before the appearance of the symptoms of dementia is unlikely to depend on the degree of its personality importance. Before it becomes strongly manifest, senile dementia does not prevent the stamping on the person's memory, at least of part of new information (possibly, of only emotionally significant). Such material may also be stored in the patients' memory even in case of pronounced dementia.

      "title": "Syncope: an overview of diagnosis and treatment",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Syncope is a syndrome in which a relatively sudden-onset, brief loss of consciousness results from a temporary self-terminating period of total cerebral hypoperfusion (1-4). In this regard, it is important to note that other conditions (e.g., epilepsy, concussions, metabolic disturbances and intoxications) may also cause a temporary loss of consciousness (TLOC) but nonetheless are not ‘syncope’ (3-5). Each of these differ from syncope either by the need for medical intervention to reverse the process (e.g., hypoglycemia) or by the underlying mechanism of the loss of consciousness (e.g., electrical disturbance in epilepsy, trauma in head injury, etc.) or both. Other conditionsmayalsomimic syncope. These are often termed ‘syncope mimics’ or ‘pseudosyncope’, but differ from syncope inasmuch as they do not cause true loss of consciousness (e.g., conversion reactions, malingering, and cataplexy). In itself, ‘syncope’ is not a complete diagnosis. Identifying the cause is important, since syncopemay be amarker of increasedmortality risk in some cases, but even more often may lead to physical injury resulting from falls or accidents, diminished quality-of-life, and possible restriction from employment or avocation. The goal should be to determine the cause of syncope with sufficient confidence to provide a reasonable assessment of prognosis, recurrence risk, and treatment options. The initial step is always the documentation of a comprehensive and detailed medical history (3-7). LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS Consciousness and ‘loss of consciousness’ (LOC) are complex concepts, but most physicians have a working understanding of what ismeant (8). Essentially, LOC implies not only loss of awareness and appropriate responsiveness to external stimuli, but also loss of postural tone. Occasionally, however, symptoms may suggest that ‘syncope’ is imminent, but the full clinical picture does not evolve at that time; such cases are often termed ‘near-syncope’. In such instances, the patient may experience near loss of vision (‘grey-out’ due principally to transient loss of blood supply to the retina), diminution of hearing, and feeling ‘out-of-touch’ with their surroundings and/or confused. On the other hand, many times patients complain of less well defined symptoms such as “dizziness” or “lightheadedness”. These latter complaints (especially in the elderly)may be due to an illdefined functional cerebral dysfunction triggered by transient hypotension (perhaps not severe enough to cause TLOC), but in most cases it is believed that such symptoms are not related to either ‘syncope’ or ‘nearsyncope’, and shouldnot be reported as such.",

      "title": "Differences of Psychopathology of Psychiatric Disorders in Adult Patients with Intellectual Disability",
      "abstract": "Intellectual disability is a mental disorder which appears during the developmental period in childhood and continues life-long. It is characterized by intellectual deficits on the one side and maladaptive social functioning on the other. The intellectual deficits include problems in abstract and logic thinking, problem solving, reasoning, learning from experience and judging. The deficits in adaptive functioning appear in problems in social communication and participation as well as in mental overload phenomena caused by daily life activities. This overload often results in psychopathological features and psychosocial reactions which are usually observed in Burn-out-Syndromes as e.g. general exhaustion (depletion of primarily reduced mental resources), additional reduced efficacy (accompanied by feelings of insufficiency and poor self-esteem), and most typically feelings alienation (towards intrinsically familiar situations, towards relatives and friends and at least also against oneself ) typically accompanied by irritability and dysphoria. Treatment programs therefore should not only focus on intellectual deficits but should include also the multiple sufferings from psychopathological phenomena and psychosocial effects of such daily life overload syndromes.

      "title": "GABAergic neurotransmission alterations in autism spectrum disorders",
      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of complex disorders of neurodevelopment characterized by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors. In ASD, deficits in social cognition and related cognitive functions would be the resultant of reduced synchronization between brain regions. A possible explanation for ASDs is the disturbance of the delicate balance between excitation and inhibition in the developing brain which may have profound impact in neurobehavioral phenotypes. At least some forms of autism would be caused by a disproportionately high level of excitation (or weaker inhibition) in neural circuits that mediate language and social behavior (local circuits). A more excitable cortex (more weakly inhibited) is functionally more poorly differentiated and could lead to broad ranging abnormalities in perception, memory and cognition, motor control, and seizures. An imbalance between excitation and inhibition could be due to an increase in glutamatergic signaling (excitatory) or reduced inhibitory GABAergic signaling. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain and some forms of ASDs are associated with alterations of GABAergic signaling. Proper inhibitory GABAergic signaling is essential for normal neural circuit function. If the inhibition is disturbed, excessive excitation results in disturbances in the excitation/inhibition balance and, consequently, dysfunction of cognitive processes. Defects in GABA A receptor subunits has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders with variable clinical presentations, supporting the hypothesis that genetic variants in GABA A receptor subunits may be risk alleles for ASD and epilepsy. Also, expression data and protein levels show a dysregulation in multiple GABA A and GABA B receptors in key sites of the brain in subjects with autism which could explain several clinical phenotypes including the presence of seizures, learning disabilities and mental retardation. In this review, we examine the evidence that alterations of GABA A receptors modified the GABAergic signaling and the excitation/inhibition ratio in ASD.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a condition characterized by an epileptic seizure that is so frequently repeated or so prolonged as to create a fixed and lasting condition. Any type of epileptic seizure can develop into SE. Status epilepticus can be classified as generalized convulsive, non-convulsive and simple partial. Generalized convulsive SE includes tonic clonic seizures with either a partial or a generalized onset. Generalized tonic clonic status is defined when consecutive seizures occur without recovery of consciousness between them. Generalized tonic clonic SE is a medical emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality if untreated. The most common etiology of SE is non-compliance to antiepileptic drugs. Other causes include alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular lesions, drug intoxication, central nervous system infections, neoplasms and acute metabolic derangements. The metabolic-biochemical complication of SE includes respiratory and metabolic acidosis, anoxia, hyperazotemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions. Prognosis of SE depends on the duration and etiology of SE. Vigorous treatment of SE is recommended. Effective medical treatment of SE includes Benzodiazepines, Phenytoin, Barbiturates and several other new antiepileptic drugs. In this presentation, we discuss the updated management of SE and propose a protocol for management of convulsive SE.",

The prevalence of delirium in elderly patients admitting to hospital is 5-55% [1]. Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome that may occur in several different settings and one of them is vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes many cerebral cortex abnormalities such as confusion, mood and memory changes, delirium with or without hallucinations, depression and acute psychotic states [2,3]. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) describes the spectrum of potentially reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities seen in patients with liver dysfunction after exclusion of unrelated neurologic and/or metabolic abnormalities. The clinical manifestations of HE is characterized by cognitive and motor deficits of varying severity without specific lesions in the central nervous system. The symptoms range from minimal changes in personality to coma, including delirium [4]. Usually, in the elderly patients with cirrhosis, it is hard to differentiate two clinical situations. Here we report a case of an elderly patient with cirrhosis who experienced delirium due to vitamin B12 deficiency, but was treated as HE before.",

Most of these patients recover full function within about 3 months, but a significant minority do not. Failure to recover as expected following a diagnosed or suspected mild TBI is most commonly related to a concurrent diagnosis or alternative diagnosis or condition. Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms. Accurate diagnosis will lead to better treatment and optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on early identification of the 'slow to recover' group to allow early and appropriate treatment.",

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation.

Major risk factors for the fluid retention syndrome comprise a strong family history of swelling symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, affective illness, including major life events, weight gain and obesity. Short term exacerbations of swelling are precipitated by emotional stress, high carbohydrate meals, alcohol, prolonged standing and exercise, high ambient temperatures and rebound oedema following the withdrawal of diuretic therapy. Management involves recognition of the syndrome, a clear explanation of its nature to the patient, the control of weight-related fluid retention by reduction to a pre-morbid target weight and the avoidance of inappropriate drug therapy. In particular, diuretics should not be prescribed for fluid-retaining symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be prescribed for patients with the fluid retention syndrome if there is biochemical evidence of ovarian failure. The role of HRT in inducing rapid bloating independently of weight gain requires evaluation by a randomised controlled clinical trial. More effective management of the syndrome awaits further understanding of the neuroendocrine substrate for the disorder.",

Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw. Verlauf des Pruritus sowie Hinweise zu ihrer jeweiligen Diagnostik Material und Methode Es handelt sich um eine Überblicksarbeit. Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

Da Unfallbeteiligte ihre Extremerlebnisse oft nicht aus eigener Kraft loesen koennen, bietet sich die Einrichtung von Anlaufstellen an, in denen Personen und Informationen verfuegbar sind, mit deren Hilfe die organisatorische und psychische Bewaeltigung von Unfallfolgen besser als bisher erfolgen kann. Seit den 80er Jahren wurde psychologische Unfallnachsorge entwickelt und seit Beginn der 90er Jahre praktisch durchgefuehrt. Das Behandlungskonzept wurde im Rahmen des Koelner Modells auch auf den Bereich des oeffentlichen Nahverkehrs uebertragen.

      "abstract": "Advances in neuroscience and pharmacology have led to improvements in the cognitive performance of people with neurological disease and other forms of cognitive decline. These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

Chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms that worsen are commonly associated with psychosocial stressors and a related adjustment disorder.

      "abstract": "In the modern world, anxiety is an important part of life. Physiological anxiety is a normal emotional response to stress, a biological response to a threat. Anxiety allows you to protect yourself and your loved ones from harm and prepare for significant events, and also serves as an important signal to take strong action in a stressful situation. The study and understanding of the specifics of the clinical structure, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of stress-related disorders in persons who have suffered as a result of hostilities is indeed the main concern for social and medical issues of our society. As the results of the study showed, patients most often complain of the following symptoms: the affect of longing (boredom, despondency, sadness, sorrow), depressed mood, a feeling of tension, danger and tightness, difficulties in adapting to new surroundings, anxiety over small things, irritability and impatience, lack of hope and prospects, internal tension with the inability to relax, a sense of loss of control over one's life, obsessive fears, sleep disorders, psycho-traumatic memories, fears and fixation on subjectively significant negative information about events in the occupied territories. In the clinical structure of post-traumatic stress disorders in the examined patients, it was found: post-traumatic stress disorder (F43.1), adjustment disorders (prolonged anxiety-depressive reaction) (F43.21), anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) and panic disorder (F41.0). The data obtained became the basis for the development of a comprehensive personalized program for the correction of anxiety disorders and rehabilitation of persons with forced displacement. The personalized program was with differentiated use of methods of psychopharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychoeducation.

This definition is meant to satisfy medical and scientific considerations as well legal and social concerns. Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

Primary anxiety is initial and dominant, whereas secondary anxiety is secondary to and less prominent than other symptoms. Primary anxiety may be rational or irrational, dependent on whether the background is apparent or not for the individual. Irrational anxiety may be somatogenic or neurotic. Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases. Both forms of anxiety neurosis may show muscular tension and vegetative symptoms and hypochondria may be superposed.",

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view.

      "title": "Mania Associated with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition in the brain. A 29-year-old housewife with secondary mania related to multiple sclerosis is described. The case highlights the importance of considering organic causes in treating patients with mania, especially when there are unexplained neurological findings and cognitive dysfunction. The case also illustrates the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging for investigating organic causes of secondary mania and psychosis. Key words: Bipolar disorder, Case report, Diagnosis, Magnetic resonance imaging, Multiple sclerosis Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode according to DSM-IV requires a distinct period of persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting at least 4 days, with at least 3 associated symptoms, such as inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition. Very often, the florid psychopathology can obscure subtle neurological/physical signs and symptoms, and make the diagnosis of the underlying organic conditions difficult. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a particularly devastating disease of the central nervous system (CNS); a patient's presenting symptoms and the temporal evolution of the clinical findings may suggest the correct diagnosis. In relapsing-remitting MS--the type present in 80% of patients--symptoms and signs typically evolve over a period of several days, stabilise, and then often improve, spontaneously or with treatment, within weeks. Relapsing-remitting MS has a peak age of onset of 20 to 40 years and has a female predominance of approximately 2:1. This type of MS typically starts with sensory disturbances, unilateral optic neuritis, diplopia, limb weakness, clumsiness, gait apraxia, and neurogenic bladder and bowel symptoms. Twenty percent of affected patients have primary progressive MS, while others may develop persistent neurological signs after relapse and the disease may progress between relapses (secondary progressive MS). Prominent cortical signs (aphasia, apraxia, recurrent seizures, visual field loss, and early dementia) and extrapyramidal phenomena (chorea and rigidity) only rarely dominate the clinical picture. Eventually, cognitive impairment, depression, emotional lability, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, progressive quadriparesis, and other CNS manifestations become troublesome. The diagnosis is based on established clinical, and when necessary, laboratory criteria. The most widely used diagnostic criteria are Poser's criteria. (1) Very recently, a new criterion developed by McDonald has been found to enable earlier diagnosis in a group of patients with one demyelinating syndrome. (2) It may become widely used in the near future. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), findings of multifocal lesions of various ages, especially those involving the periventricular white matter, brain stem, cerebellum, and the spinal cord white matter, support the clinical impression. The presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI indicates current sites of presumed inflammatory demyelination (active lesions). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis often shows increased intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins of restricted specificity, oligoclonal bands may be present, or the synthesis of immunogobulin G (IgG) may be increased. Physiological evidence of subclinical dysfunction of optic nerves and spinal cord (changes in visual evoked responses and somatosensory evoked potentials) may further support the diagnosis. A case of a 29-year-old married woman with secondary hypomanic features associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) is presented, along with a review of the subject. …",

Clinically, cognitive dysfunction can be characterized as debilitation of cognitive dysfunctions, including memory, learning, focus, and speed of mental action. Influencing surgical patients in all age bunches over the short term, cognitive dysfunction shows days or weeks after surgery and shows quicker determination in more youthful populations, in spite of the fact that it might be perpetual. Generally, communicated by patients as another powerlessness to finish once effectively feasible tasks, signs include trouble staying concentrated on an errand, failure to multitask, trouble discovering words and reviewing information recently obtained. In more extreme cases, post-operative cognitive dysfunction can bring about a calamitous loss of cognitive capacity, with related expanded mortality, danger of rashly leaving work, and reliance on social welfare.",

Insufficient sleep can have important effects on daytime function by increasing the need to nap, reducing cognitive ability including attention and memory, slowing response time, adversely affecting relationships with friends and family, and contributing to a general sense of being unwell. However, rather than aging per se, circadian rhythm shifts, primary sleep disorders, comorbid medical/psychiatric illnesses, and medication use cause sleep difficulties in older people, which psychosocial factors may also affect. Clinicians should ask elderly patients about satisfaction with sleep. Any sleep complaints warrant careful evaluation of contributing factors and appropriate treatment.",

The non-epileptic seizures can be classified as psychogenic, which do not have a medical cause, and are associated with primary or secondary psychological problems, and as of physiological origin. The non-epileptic events are manifested by paroxysmal or repetitive behaviors that might be confused with epileptic seizures. The diagnosis is very important in order to avoid unnecessary tests and iatrogenic therapies. This study will present clinical cases and review of the main non-epileptic physiological events (sleep disorders, movement disorders, hypoxic-ischemic phenomena) and psychogenic events (somatoform disorders, fictitious disorders and anxiety disorder).",

Epilepsy may cause transient epileptic higher brain dysfunctions like transient epileptic amnesia (TEA), or persistent epileptic higher brain dysfunction with or without findings of non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). These are all defined as epilepsy with higher brain dysfunction (E-HBD). Amnesia, aphasia, or personality/behavior change are well known symptoms of E-HBD. Geshwind syndrome including personality changes seen in temporal epileptic patients, and Klüver-Bucy syndrome have also reported as a symptom of epilepsy. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are used to prevent convulsive or non-convulsive attacks, but it may cause higher brain dysfunction. Sedation, impairment of concentration or memory, and dizziness are frequently seen as cognitive side effects of AEDs. We review these higher brain dysfunctions in epileptic patients, and report a case of limbic encephalitis.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

      "title": "A Comprehensive Review on the Screening Models for the Pharmacological Assessment of Antipsychotic Drugs",
      "abstract": "Background: Psychosis is a debilitating mental disorder characterized by a profound disconnection from reality, manifesting in symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. The pathophysiology of psychosis is multifaceted, involving an interplay of neurobiological, genetic, and environmental factors. Neurobiologically, dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems particularly dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic pathways-plays a central role, with excessive dopaminergic activity linked to positive symptoms and glutamatergic dysfunction implicated in cognitive impairments. Genetic predisposition, evidenced by significant heritability and associations with specific genetic variants, intersects with environmental factors such as stress, trauma, and substance use to influence the onset and progression of psychosis. Cognitive disruptions, including deficits in attention, memory, and executive function, exacerbate the disorder’s impact. This phenomenon has led to short-term as well as long-term psychosocial and mental health implications for all. Objective: To determine the antipsychotic activity of pharmaceuticals, numerous antipsychotic screening models are available. Determining the optimal animal model for measuring antipsychotic activity is the primary goal of this study. Methods: A search for literature was carried out using several keywords, including \"Antipsychotic,\" \"In-vivo models,\" \"In-vitro models,\" and \"Behavior models,\" on the databases Science Direct and PubMed. For the purpose of obtaining the most appropriate articles to fulfil the goal of this review article, the search was customized by using the necessary filters. Results: Research and review articles based on neuroleptic screening models are available to determine the antipsychotic activity of novel pharmacological compounds. Conclusion: Following our research, we identified several helpful models for evaluating the antipsychotic activity of pharmaceuticals and proposed that combining invitro and in-vivo techniques with behavioral methodologies might yield the most appropriate results for our field of study.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia but other neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular disease and chronic infections such as syphilis can also lead to the clinical syndrome of dementia. Initial investigations should always focus on finding any treatable cause for dementia such as HIV, structural lesions such as subdural haematomas or specific nutritional deficiency states such as that due to vitamin B12 and treated appropriately. Where no treatable or reversible aetiology is found, a referral to a specialist should be considered who may initiate further investigations including magnetic resonance imaging or perfusion single-photon emission computerised tomography scans of the brain, and sometimes cerebrospinal fluid examination or an electroencephalogram.",

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

The pathological manifestations of cerebral damage are usually believed to be of two general types—first, those symptoms which result directly from the loss of or damage to cerebral tissue, and, second, symptoms not directly associated with tissue loss, but, rather, symptoms of indirect or \"superimposed\" psychological disturbances, e.g., the patient's reactions to or attitudes toward disability occasioned by brain damage. Evidence of cerebral dysfunction may show up in one or more areas, such as sensory or motor function, intellectual functioning, emotional control, manifestation of seizure phenomena, and others.

      "title": "PIK3CA-Related Segmental Overgrowth",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth includes disorders of brain (e.g., MCAP [megalencephaly-capillary malformation] syndrome, hemimegalencephaly); and segmental body overgrowth (e.g., CLOVES [congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies] syndrome, fibroadipose hyperplasia [FH]). Heterozygous (usually somatic mosaic) pathogenic variants of PIK3CA are causative. MCAP syndrome is characterized by the major findings of (1) megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) associated with neurologic findings of hypotonia, seizures, and mild to severe intellectual disability; and (2) cutaneous capillary malformations with focal or generalized somatic overgrowth. Additional findings can include digital anomalies (syndactyly, polydactyly), cortical malformations – most distinctively polymicrogyria (PMG); and variable connective tissue dysplasia. CLOVES (or CLOVE) syndrome and fibroadipose hyperplasia (FH) may be associated with (1) MEG or HMEG; and (2) patchy segmental overgrowth associated with skeletal anomalies, lipomatosis, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi. Diagnosis/testing PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is confirmed in an individual with a pathogenic variant on one PIK3CA allele, typically in affected tissues. Because the vast majority of PIK3CA pathogenic variants arise postzygotic (and are thus mosaic), more than one tissue may need to be tested. Failure to detect a PIK3CA pathogenic variant does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of the PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth disorders in individuals with suggestive features. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant or lipomatous segmental overgrowth may require debulking; scoliosis and leg-length discrepancy may require orthopedic care and surgical intervention. Neurologic complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, progressive and/or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia or Chiari malformation; epilepsy in those with HMEG) may warrant neurosurgical intervention. Routine treatment of the following, when present, is indicated: cardiac and renal abnormalities; intellectual disabilities and behavior problems; motor difficulties; speech, swallowing, and feeding difficulties. Surveillance: MCAP syndrome: Follow up no less than every six months until age six years and at least yearly thereafter to monitor for neurosurgical complications, breathing or sleep disorders, seizures and orthopedic complications. Provisionally recommended imaging in early childhood includes brain MRI every six months for the first two years, then yearly until age eight years for neurologic complications (e.g., hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia). Consider screening for Wilms tumor following the protocol suggested for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (by ultrasound examination every 3 months until age 8 years); however, tumor risk in PIK3CA-related segmental overgrowth is undetermined and appears to be lower than in BWS. CLOVES syndrome and FH: Monitoring for severe scoliosis, infiltrative lipomatous overgrowth, paraspinal high-flow lesions with spinal cord ischemia, lymphatic malformations, cutaneous vesicles, orthopedic problems, central phlebectasias, and thromboembolism. Genetic counseling PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is not typically inherited. Most affected individuals with MCAP reported to date (21/24) had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA, suggesting that mutation occurred post-fertilization in one cell of the multicellular embryo. Two of 24 affected individuals had a de novo germline pathogenic variant in PIK3CA. All reported individuals with CLOVES and FH had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA. No confirmed instances of vertical transmission or sib recurrence have been reported. Because family members are not known to have an increased risk, prenatal diagnosis is usually not indicated for family members.",

      "title": "The role of depression in coronary artery disease",
      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

      "title": "Presenting Symptoms of Pituitary Apoplexy",
      "abstract": "Abstract The classical term “pituitary apoplexy” (PA) describes a clinical syndrome usually characterized by abrupt onset of headache accompanied by neurologic and/or endocrinologic deterioration due to sudden expansion of a mass within the sella turcica as a result of hemorrhage or infarction within a pituitary tumor and adjacent pituitary gland. PA is a medical emergency and a difficult diagnosis to establish. Thus this article reviews the presenting symptoms of PA patients to help clinicians recognize or at least suspect this critical condition early on. PA commonly occurs in the setting of a preexisting adenoma, and several patients are unaware of its existence prior to the onset of apoplexy symptoms, which are mainly of a neurologic, ophthalmologic, and endocrinologic nature. Neurologic symptoms include sudden-onset severe headache and other symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, symptoms from compression of the cavernous sinus contents, nausea/vomiting, impaired consciousness, and symptoms of meningeal irritation. Ophthalmologic symptoms include visual field defects, visual loss, diplopia, and ophthalmoplegia. Endocrinologic disturbances include pituitary adenoma symptoms, cortisol deficiency, panhypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging method of choice to aid the PA diagnosis. Its differential diagnoses include cerebrovascular accidents, infectious diseases, and other causes of endocrinologic imbalance. Transsphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice, especially if there are associated visual abnormalities and ophthalmoplegia. Clinicians should be aware of the presenting symptoms because early diagnosis may reduce the morbidity and mortality of this neurosurgical emergency.",

      "title": "Concussion and mild head injury",
      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

Because the basis of normal brain function is not sufficiently understood, the basis of abnormal function is understood poorly. Even in disorders where the fundamental biochemical defect is known, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and other enzyme defects, the exact basis for brain dysfunction is uncertain. The outcome for treated PKU, galactosemia, homocystinuria, and lysosomal disorders is not yet optimal. The various forms of nonketotic hyperglycinemia often respond poorly to current therapy. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures, such as deficient synthesis of serine or creatine and impaired glucose transport into the brain, and disorders with variable malformations, such as Smith‐Lemli‐Opitz (SLO) syndrome and the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures and disorders with variable malformations may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Simple tests of urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid may lead to a diagnosis, accurate genetic counseling, and better treatment.

It includes delusional beliefs about bodily sensations or functions; such as feeling malodorous, being infected by parasites, having dysmorphic features, or that a certain organ is no longer functioning. MHP has been divided into 4 main categories: Delusions of infestation (including parasitosis); delusions of dysmorphophobia, such as of misshapenness, personal ugliness, or exaggerated size of body parts (this seems closest to that of body dysmorphic disorder); delusions of foul body odours or halitosis or delusional bromosis (also known as olfactory reference syndrome); and a miscellaneous group.",

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

Treatment strategies may vary based on the level of acuity of injury, duration of symptoms of arousal disorders, and availability of institutional resources. Brain trauma, infections, metabolic disturbances, and/or exposure to anesthesia or certain types of medications often results in persistent impairments in ability to focus, sustain attention, and consciously access information about oneself and the environment.

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Many of these are psychologic, being in reality a fixed idea of incapacity derived from the suggestions of medical men or friends, or, perhaps, because of some internal mental conflict which makes the motives for invalidism paramount over those for normal active life. Such patients often actually do become weak, either from mere inaction, or from the malassimilation induced thereby and the worries they permit themselves; this is a familiar picture in a traumatic neurosis,<sup>1</sup>so-called.

What is less understood is the clinical world of apraxia--'inability to perform purposeful skilled movements in the absence of any elementary motor (weakness, akinesia, abnormal posture or tone) or sensory deficits, or impaired comprehension or memory'. Much of what clinicians call apraxia is a failure of gesture production to command, due to problems of transcoding language into motor action, without motor deficit in ordinary life. However, damage to premotor regions and superior parietal lobules provokes devastating spontaneous higher-order motor deficits, including limb-kinetic apraxia, diagnostic apraxia, visuomotor apraxia and ideational apraxia.",

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

For the differential diagnosis, history and other symptoms are important such as hemiplegia, signs of brain stem dysfunction, meningism or headache. Metabolic, endocrinologic, toxicologic or electrolytic causes of coma usually can be diagnosed by laboratory examinations. Anamnestic informations, body inspection, clinical neurological examination as well as laboratory and imaging findings have to be added and categorized by a multilevel composition to establish a conclusive diagnosis. Simultaneously therapeutic measures for suspected primary cerebral diseases must be initiated, for example a rapid antibiotic treatment in case of a possible bacterial meningitis. A fast and structured diagnostic approach is crucial for ensuring a good prognosis and helps to miss relevant diagnostic steps. Potential diagnostic and therapeutic pitfalls must be kept in mind.",

Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

In this study, 50 violent offenders were interviewed with neuropsychological and psychometric measures, to determine the factors that underlie amnesia and the recovery of memory in these cases. The results showed that amnesia for a violent offense was associated with crimes of passion and dissociative symptoms at the time, but not with impaired neuropsychological functioning. Long amnesic gaps were associated with a state of dissociation surrounding the offense and with previous blackouts (whether alcoholic or dissociative). Memory often recovered, either partially or completely, especially where there was a history of blackouts or a lengthy amnesic gap. Brief amnesic gaps were likely to persist, perhaps as a consequence of faulty encoding during a period of extreme emotional arousal (or red-out).",

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms. DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders—dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder—as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder—other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediately after the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation. In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]). DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately. A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent. Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder. DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option—\"other specified dissociative disorder\"—for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).",

      "abstract": "Learning disabilities are a heterogeneous diagnostic category. As a specific disorder learning disabilities include reading disorders, disorders of written expression and mathematics disorders. As a general concept, learning disabilities may be categorised into four symptom complexes, which are not mutually exclusive: 1. dyslexia, 2. motor-perceptual; 3. language delay; 4. hyperactivity. In clinical settings these neurodevelopmental disorders are diagnosed in school-aged children. The most common referral reasons are significant difficulties in school achievement or difficulties in child adjustment and functioning that are manifested through behavioural and emotional difficulties caused by learning disabilities. Since academic achievement is an important aspect of self-esteem in childhood, school failure may result in many short-term and long-term consequences for the child’s functioning in narrow and broader social contexts, development of maladaptive behaviour and also cause the development of psychopathology. The most common short-term consequences include low academic and general self-esteem, lack of motivation for schooling and related obligations, behavioural disorders, a sense of overload in the child, peer relationship problems and a heightened level of family conflicts. The usual long-term outcomes are psychosomatic problems, affective disorders (depression, anxiety) and severe behavioural problems. Furthermore, longitudinal studies show the persistence of certain problems in adulthood.In summary, impairments should be adequately assessed to evaluate the cognitive deficits and strengths, and a precise diagnosis should be established. Once problem areas have been identified, special teaching strategies can be devised in collaboration with the school to circumvent handicaps. Also, an important part of intervention includes counselling of parents and children.",

Signs include poor judgment, a general negative outlook, excessive worrying, moodiness, irritability, agitation, inability to relax, feeling lonely, isolated or depressed, aches and pains, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, dizziness, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, eating too much or not enough, sleeping too much or not enough, social withdrawal, procrastination or neglect of responsibilities, increased alcohal, nicotine or drug consumption, and nervous habits such as pacing about, nail-biting and neck pains.Occupational stress stress involving work.

      "title": "Autoimmune Encephalitis - a diagnosis not to be overlooked in cases of psychosis",
      "abstract": "Introduction Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a neuroinflammatory condition that often presents with psychiatric symptoms, such as psychosis, mood disturbances, and cognitive impairment, mimicking psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These symptoms frequently appear before neurological signs, complicating diagnosis and delaying treatment. Early recognition of this condition is fundamental to improve patients outcomes. Objectives This review examines the psychiatric manifestations of AE, highlights challenges in differentiating AE from primary psychiatric disorders, and emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. Methods A nonsystematic review of literature focusing on the psychiatric presentation of AE. Results AE often presents with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, agitation, and mood disturbances, frequently leading to misdiagnoses such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. In particular, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is associated with severe psychiatric manifestations like psychosis. Diagnosis is based on recognizing the rapid progression of psychiatric symptoms, along with seizures or other neurological signs, and confirming the autoimmune cause through specific autoantibody tests. Early treatment is essential to reverse these psychiatric symptoms. However, delayed diagnosis can result in persistent cognitive and psychiatric difficulties even after treatment. Diagnosing the psychiatric manifestations of AE is challenging due to their overlap with primary psychiatric disorders. However, the rapid onset and progression of symptoms, combined with neurological signs, should prompt clinicians to consider an autoimmune origin. Autoantibodies, particularly those against NMDA receptors, disrupt neurotransmitter systems, explaining the psychiatric features of AE. While psychotropic medications may provide temporary symptom relief, they do not target the underlying immune dysfunction. Timely immunotherapy significantly improves outcomes, and multidisciplinary collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists is crucial for comprehensive patient care. Conclusions AE should be considered in cases of acute psychosis, mood disturbances, or cognitive impairment. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to preventing long-term psychiatric and neurological issues. Greater awareness of AE’s psychiatric presentations aids in distinguishing it from primary psychiatric disorders and facilitates timely treatment. Further research is needed to explore the neuroimmune mechanisms behind AE and optimize treatment. Collaborative efforts between psychiatry and neurology are essential for successful patient outcomes. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

As assistance with everyday tasks becomes necessary, modifiable psychosocial and medical factors intersect with neurodegenerative processes to create preventable or manageable challenges that are unique to the individual with the disorder and his or her family. Health psychology plays an important role in identifying and overcoming these challenges, thereby preventing excess disability, increasing quality of life, and promoting health for patients and care partners.",

Patients with anomic aphasia manifest an isolated deficit in their ability to name things like concrete entities (named by nouns), actions (named by verbs), or spatial relationships (named by prepositions). Defective naming, also known as anomia, is a frequent part of the symptom complex that characterizes patients with aphasia (Goodglass &amp; Wingfield, 1997; Tranel &amp; Anderson, 1999), where aphasia refers to disturbances of the comprehension and formulation of verbal messages caused by acquired damage to language‐related brain structures (typically in the left hemisphere).",

      "title": "Sialorrhea: a review of a vexing, often unrecognized sign of oropharyngeal and esophageal disease.",
      "abstract": "Saliva is produced by the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual), as well as several smaller glands. Salivary flow can be altered by multiple entities. There is much written regarding xerostomia (\"dry mouth\"), the condition related to inhibited or decreased salivary flow. This condition is widely recognized in certain systemic diseases, particularly Sjögren syndrome, diabetes mellitus, after anticholinergic, antihistamine, and decongestant medications, as well as states of enhanced sympathetic drive, such as anxiety or emotional disturbances and various other psychosocial conditions. On the other hand, sialorrhea or ptyalism, the condition of increased salivary flow, is rarely discussed in the clinical literature. Sialorrhea can occur with various neurologic disorders, infections, the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, heavy metal poisoning, Wilson disease, Angelman syndrome, as well as a relatively unknown condition called idiopathic paroxysmal sialorrhea. Normal salivation may be altered by drugs (such as clozapine, risperidone, nitrazepam, lithium, and bethanecol) that have a cholinergic effect that induces sialorrhea. This report focuses on sialorrhea as it relates to disorders of the oropharynx and esophagus. The patient typically recognizes a problem with excessive \"foamy mucus\" but does not understand its origin. Infections and obstruction are the most common oropharyngeal causes. Increased salivary flow occurs as a typically subtle manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease. This occurrence is referred to as water brash. Idiopathic achalasia and megaesophagus due to the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are regularly associated with sialorrhea. Esophageal obstruction (foreign body, cancer, or stricture formation), infection, and nasogastric intubation are the more common conditions associated with the symptomatic sequelae of sialorrhea. Sialorrhea-related respiratory and pulmonary complications are greatest in those with a diminished sensation of salivary flow and hypopharyngeal retention. Extremes of age, the chronically debilitated, or those in chronic care facilities, especially associated with cerebrovascular accidents and esophageal cancer, typically comprise this population. For the patient with an intact awareness of saliva, sialorrhea can present with significant social stigmas. Occult drooling or regular oral evacuation into a tissue or \"spit cup\" is socially incapacitating. This report provides a review of the physiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and therapeutic options for sialorrhea. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should recognize the importance of sialorrhea as a possible indicator or complication of a variety of disease states of the oropharynx and esophagus as well as its impact on the patient's physical and social quality of life.",

      "title": "Análisis evolutivo y valoración neuropsicológica integral de pacientes con deterioro cognitivo leve o enfermedad de Alzheimer.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION \nEl envejecimiento de la poblacion esta causando un aumento en la aparicion de patologias asociadas a la edad, como es el caso de las demencias. Afortunadamente los avances de las Ciencias de la Salud como la Medicina, la Psicologia y, en particular, la Neuropsicologia estan aportando herramientas de gran utilidad para la evaluacion, el diagnostico y el tratamiento de procesos como el Deterioro Cognitivo Leve (DCL) y la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA).\nEl Deterioro Cognitivo Leve es definido como un sindrome clinico caracterizado por la alteracion adquirida en una o mas areas cognitivas (atencion, funciones ejecutivas, lenguaje, memoria o area visuoespacial) con una duracion de meses a anos, que sin cumplir los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia excede a lo esperado por la edad. La afectacion es referida por el propio paciente o por un informador y debe ser objetivada en la exploracion neuropsicologica, pudiendo provocar una interferencia minima en el desarrollo de las actividades habituales. El DCL es frecuentemente ubicado en un continuo que transcurre desde el envejecimiento normal hasta la enfermedad de Alzheimer, considerando a las personas con DCL como un grupo poblacional con alto riesgo de padecer posteriormente demencia (predominantemente Enfermedad de Alzheimer).\nLa Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) ha sido la demencia mas estudiada y aunque su evolucion es heterogenea, la afectacion cognoscitiva mas grave en los primeros estadios es la alteracion de la memoria. La EA se caracteriza por un comienzo insidioso, dificultando la discriminacion y la realizacion de un diagnostico temprano. Conforme avanza la enfermedad otras areas cognitivas se ven gravemente afectadas.\n Por tanto, la definicion del perfil clinico y neuropsicologico asociado a las primeras etapas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es crucial para facilitar la deteccion temprana de la enfermedad, establecer el punto de partida para una intervencion adecuada y poder llevar a cabo un seguimiento de la evolucion de manera controlada.\nOBJETIVO\nEn la presente Tesis Doctoral se analiza el perfil neuropsicologico integral y el curso evolutivo de pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve y Enfermedad de Alzheimer en dos estadios, leve y moderado, atendiendo a la capacidad funcional y cognitiva en tres momentos diferentes de su evolucion, al inicio y a los seis y doce meses.\nMATERIAL Y METODOS\nSe han llevado a cabo cinco estudios basados en una metodologia descriptiva transversal (Estudios I-IV) y longitudinal (Estudio V), mediante la exploracion neuropsicologica integral y clinica de una muestra inicial de 116 pacientes de los cuales 72 se han ajustado a los criterios de inclusion en la fase de valoracion basal y 44 en la fase de evolucion. El protocolo de evaluacion ha estado conformado por los siguientes tests de screening, de funcionalidad y de dominio cognitivo especifico: Examen Cognoscitivo MiniMental, Test de los 7 Minutos, Escala de Deterioro Global (GDS), Escala para las Actividades Basicas de la Vida diaria BARTHEL, Escala de sobrecarga del cuidador de ZARIT, Cuestionario de Actividad Funcional (FAQ) de Pfeiffer y diferentes subtests del Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica-Test Barcelona.\nRESULTADOS\nA nivel funcional, el grupo con DCL inicialmente era independiente en el desarrollo de las ABVDs pero conforme ha transcurrido el tiempo han comenzado a requerir cierta supervision en sus actividades. A nivel cognitivo inicialmente han presentado afectacion principal de las funciones ejecutivas, la memoria diferida y la velocidad de procesamiento, manteniendo preservadas a los doce meses de investigacion el resto de las funciones evaluadas aunque con un descenso en la ejecucion a los seis meses en orientacion temporal y fluencia verbal.\nLos pacientes con EAL han presentado dependencia funcional desde el inicio incrementada a los doce meses. A nivel cognitivo, en la valoracion inicial se han encontrado resultados sugerentes de afectacion en las funciones ejecutivas (planificacion y secuenciacion), memoria verbal (inmediata y diferida) y velocidad de procesamiento. A los seis meses han comenzado a verse afectadas las funciones de span atencional, coordinacion motora, denominacion y comprension lectora y a los doce meses la orientacion temporal tambien se ha visto afectada. Los sujetos han preservado algunas funciones como la orientacion espacial, lenguaje (automatico, repeticion de palabras, comprension auditiva), praxias ideomotoras y abstraccion verbal.\nPor ultimo, los sujetos con EAM han mostrado alteracion funcional inicial y afectacion de casi todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas (orientacion temporal y espacial, abstraccion, planificacion y secuenciacion, control mental, span atencional, repeticion de material verbal extenso, fluencia verbal semantica y fonetica, comprension verbal auditiva y lectora, praxias ideomotoras, memoria y velocidad de procesamiento). A los seis meses se ha afectado tambien la orientacion en persona y la denominacion de imagenes. En la ultima evaluacion todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas han estado afectadas a excepcion de la capacidad para repetir palabras conocidas y logatomos y para emitir series automaticas del lenguaje cuando son requeridas en orden directo.\nCONCLUSION\nLos sujetos con DCL han comenzado a presentar alteraciones clinicas que les conducen a sentir limitaciones clinicas considerables y que son percibidas por el propio paciente y por las personas de su entorno. En el caso de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer, la evolucion de la misma termina por causar afectacion de todas las funciones mentales superiores y conduce al paciente a un estado de dependencia donde requieren una ayuda continua cada dia. Ademas las areas que en estadios mas temprano comienzan a alterarse son las que se han observado dramaticamente mas afectadas en estadios mas avanzados (memoria, funciones ejecutivas y velocidad de procesamiento).\nLa evaluacion realizada en esta investigacion ha contibuido a la definicion del perfil neuropsicologico de los pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer en estadio leve y moderado, facilitando la labor de discriminar la afectacion funcional y cognitiva inicial en los tres grupos de estudio.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer, Perfil Neuropsicologico, Evaluacion Neuropsicologica",

Depression frequently occurs after stroke and influences functional recovery, a crucial factor for the prognosis. The physiopathology of post-stroke depression is not entirely elucidated and might involve several mechanisms: direct consequences of brain lesions, especially in certain localizations, neuroendocrine mechanism or psychological reaction to a life event responsible for stress and handicap. Antidepressant drugs improve depressive symptoms and functional recovery. Therefore, search for depression should be systematic early at the stroke reeducation phase to instaure appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "This chapter deals mainly with common acute and chronic neurological problems, particularly as they affect employees and job applicants. The complications of occupational exposure to neurotoxins and putative neurotoxins are also covered in so far as they relate to the fitness of an exposed employee to continue working. In addition to a few well-known and common conditions, many uncommon but distinct neurological disorders may present at work or affect work capacity. Fitness for work in these disorders will be determined by the person’s functional abilities, any co-morbid illness, the efficacy or side effects of the treatment, and psychological and social factors, rather than by the precise diagnosis. This will also need to be put into the context of the job in question, as the basic requirements for a manual labouring job may be completely different from something more intellectually demanding. Indeed, even an apparently precise diagnostic label such as multiple sclerosis can encompass a complete spectrum of disability, from someone who is entirely asymptomatic to another who is totally incapacitated. Furthermore, reports by general practitioners, neurologists, or neurosurgeons may describe the symptoms, signs, and investigations in detail, but without analysing functional abilities. These colleagues may also fail to appreciate the workplace hazards, the responsibilities of the employer, or what scope exists for adaptations to the job or workplace.",

A patient affected by anterograde amnesia, is temporarily less able to remember what he or she has experienced over a period of three months after treatment. The brain of a patient with retrograde amnesia is unable to retrieve or remember information or procedures 'saved' before the treatment took place. More specifically the patient with retrograde amnesia has three main types of problems: semantic memory problems (relating to facts), episodic memory problems (no longer able to retrieve memories concerning non-personal events), and procedural memory problems (no longer able to operate various devices). It is difficult to predict which patients will experience cognitive problems as a result from ect and to what extent. However, the problems are not intensified by maintenance treatment. Factual and autobiographical memory problems following ect-induced retrograde amnesia seems to have a more permanent character. According to the Dutch guidelines for ECT, cognitive side-effects need to be monitored. If patients are monitored before and after ect, they can be given a more targeted psycho-education and eventually a more targeted training course.We conclude that in clinical practice increasing attention is being given to ECT-related cognitive side-effects. Clearly, however, more consideration needs to be given to inter-individual variability. Cognitive monitoring is advisable because the course of the side-effects of ect must be followed and evaluated.",

      "title": "Somatisation as a manifestation of emotional disturbance in children",
      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

PA stanowi część pamięci dotyczącą osobistej przeszłości jednostki. Zawiera wspomnienia o charakterze epizodycznym i semantycznym związane z tożsamością. Wpływa na aktywność oraz konstruowanie celów, jest osadzona w doświadczeniu i emocjach człowieka, pomaga w tworzeniu planów. Prawdopodobnie ewolucyjnym znaczeniem PA jest ułatwienie zachowań ukierunkowanych na krótkoterminowy cel poprzez porównanie z poprzednimi. Ludzie z zaburzeniami PA mają niejednokrotnie trudności w funkcjonowaniu społecznym. Zaburzenia życia uczuciowego i afektu, obecne w większości zaburzeń psychicznych będą deformowały PA. Potwierdzono to m. in. w zaburzeniach stresowych pourazowych, zaburzeniach depresyjnych, autyzmie, schizofrenii czy zespole zależności alkoholowej. Za jedno z najlepiej przebadanych nieprawidłowości PA należy uznać: nadmiernie generalne wspomnienia (niemożność przywoływania wspomnień w pełni wysyconych szczegółami), typowe dla depresji i przebłyski (mimowolne przywoływanie wspomnień silnie wysyconych treściami wzrokowo-sensorycznymi) charakterystyczne dla zaburzeń stresowych pourazowych. Badanie zjawiska PA potencjalnie niesie wiele implikacji poznawczych jak i klinicznych. Może ułatwić przewidywanie wystąpienia epizodu depresji u osób nim zagrożonych, może pomóc w wykształceniu technik psychoterapeutycznych, co częściowo ma już miejsce, co częściowo ma już miejsce.

      "title": "Comparison of cognitive failures in addicts and non addicts",
      "abstract": "Cognition is one of the interesting areas of research in addiction field. There are many studies that attempt to explore the relationship between cognitive abilities and addiction. The relationship between cognitive failures and clinical and social outcomes in patients and addicts has been mentioned in many studies. It seems that cognitive impairment is one of the strong predictor of social dysfunction in addicted people. Cognitive failures are defined as inabilities to successfully perform tasks that one might typically be able to do on a daily basis. Some examples include forgetting appointments, leaving mail unanswered for days, failure to notice street signs, and having to reread passages of text. Such failures in everyday activities are due to underlying problems in general cognitive functions related to distractibility and memory. In general, cognitive failures include failures in perception, memory, and motor functioning, in which the action does not match the intention. Thus, cognitive failures include numerous types of execution lapses: lapses in attention (i.e., failure in perception), memory (i.e., failures related to information retrieval), and motor function (i.e., the performance of unintended actions, or action slips). While cognitive failures occur frequently and many do not produce any serious consequences, some - under specific circumstances - will result in unpleasant consequences, for example, accident. The goal of this study was to compare the cognitive component failure in addicted and non-addicted people. This study was causal-comparative. 45 addicted people (70%male), who have at least five years addiction history, selected from different counseling centers in Kerman, and were matched in terms of age, sex, and education level with 45 non-addicted people. After obtaining participants' consent, the cognitive failures questionnaire (CFQ) was completed by all two groups. MANOVA was used for the data analysis. The results showed that cognitive failures components, including distraction, failure of memory, oversight and forgetfulness of addicted people are significantly higher than non-addicted people. This study was conducted to compare cognitive failures in addicted and non-addicted people. The components of the cognitive failures in addicts and normal individuals were significantly different, which is probably a result of drug abuse. Not only these cognitive failures might be effective in drug abuse, but it seems they prevent from leaving addiction. Thus, correcting these failures may be helpful in treatment and prevention of recurrent addiction. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of this correcting on addiction.",

      "title": "Dyslexia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dyslexia is a disorder characterised by difficulty in learning to read that cannot be attributed to secondary organic, mechanical or social circumstances. In other words, a child fails to learn to read at an age‐appropriate rate, irrespective of intelligence level, education or other neurological deficits. Notably, developmental dyslexia – which is the focus of this article – is distinct from acquired dyslexia, which occurs due to brain trauma. Numerous sensory and cognitive deficits contribute to dyslexia, including difficulties with auditory processing of speech sounds, visual processing and working memory. Current research is aimed at understanding the neurobiological cause of these cognitive deficits. Key Concepts Dyslexia is a universal and persistent form of low literacy in which a child fails to learn to read at an age‐appropriate rate. It is found across languages and is not associated with intelligence, age, education or other neurological deficits. Symptoms of dyslexia and their severity can vary significantly from one individual to the next. People with dyslexia have been found to have Impaired phonological processing – that is, a decreased perceptual sensitivity to sound‐segments in language. Difficulties with short‐term memory. Impaired visual processing. Spelling difficulties. Phonological dyslexia refers to difficulties in sounding words out and making phonological manipulations. Surface dyslexia refers to difficulties in developing and accessing a lexicon, that is a mental representation of words. Dyslexia is often confused with visual stress – the symptoms of which include words moving when attempting to read, shimmering or disappearing, words looking like they were carved into the page, lines or rivers through the text, and preferring to read under very low light levels. The exact aetiology of dyslexia is unknown; however, evidence indicates deficits in magnocellular‐dorsal stream processing in the visual domain and impaired brainwave function in the auditory domain. Several genetic mutations have also been identified in dyslexia. Current remedial interventions for dyslexia are educational and are aimed at improving cognitive deficits. Current research is aimed at identifying the neurobiological basis of dyslexia to aid the development of a treatment that targets the underlying neurobiological cause of dyslexia.",

Delirium can be precipitated by any somatic factor, which includes a variety of different illnesses, surgery, or substance (medication) intoxication or withdrawal. Predisposing factors are higher age and cognitive and functional impairment, among others. A final common pathway seems to be the most plausible for this multifactorial syndrome. The current leading candidate for the final pathway is the neurotransmitter state of relative acetylcholine deficiency and dopamine excess, together with an exaggerated inflammatory cascade. Although prevention of delirium should be the main aim, treatment consists of non-pharmacologic measures, reversing the precipitating conditions, and judicious use of antipsychotics in severely agitated patients only. Delirium is independently associated with an increase in mortality, impaired physical and cognitive recovery, and increased hospital costs.",

However, research has shown that sleep is also required for other vital processes such as memory consolidation and normal physiological functioning. Extensive research has shown that the areas that control our sleeping behaviour are the hypothalamus, brain stem, midbrain, and amygdala. These areas coordinate events during the non-REM and REM phases of sleep-wake cycles. GABA and adenosine, two chemical neurotransmitters, are also involved and play an important role in our sleep cycle. Insomnia has caused a slew of psychological and physiological issues such as fatigue, decreased mental concentration, irritable nature and a higher risk of heart attacks and stroke. It has reduced the patient's quality of life of the patient and have a social impact on them. Primary insomnia is defined as the inability/absence of proper sleep and impaired daily life functioning. Secondary insomnia, on the other hand, is believed to result from pre-existing medical conditions, substance abuse, or as a side effect of certain drug therapy. Insomnia is diagnosed through physical examination and the use of electrical devices to monitor sleep behavior.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

It is usually recognized by the sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and loss of general interest that accompanies it, but undoubtedly many people are given needless operations and many patients refuse to get well because the symptoms rather than the underlying depression are treated.

      "title": "Neuroimaging and psychometric assessment of mild cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be serious partly due to the challenges of assessing and treating its neurocognitive and affective sequelae. The effects of a single TBI may persist for years and can limit patients’ activities due to somatic complaints (headaches, vertigo, sleep disturbances, nausea, light or sound sensitivity), affective sequelae (post-traumatic depressive symptoms, anxiety, irritability, emotional instability) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, including social cognition disturbances, attention deficits, information processing speed decreases, memory degradation and executive dysfunction). Despite a growing amount of research, study comparison and knowledge synthesis in this field are problematic due to TBI heterogeneity and factors like injury mechanism, age at or time since injury. The relative lack of standardization in neuropsychological assessment strategies for quantifying sequelae adds to these challenges, and the proper administration of neuropsychological testing relative to the relationship between TBI, MCI and neuroimaging has not been reviewed satisfactorily. Social cognition impairments after TBI (e.g., disturbed emotion recognition, theory of mind impairment, altered self-awareness) and their neuroimaging correlates have not been explored thoroughly. This review consolidates recent findings on the cognitive and affective consequences of TBI in relation to neuropsychological testing strategies, to neurobiological and neuroimaging correlates, and to patient age at and assessment time after injury. All cognitive domains recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) are reviewed, including social cognition, complex attention, learning and memory, executive function, language and perceptual-motor function. Affect and effort are additionally discussed owing to their relationships to cognition and to their potentially confounding effects. Our findings highlight non-negligible cognitive and affective impairments following TBI, their gravity often increasing with injury severity. Future research should study (A) language, executive and perceptual-motor function (whose evolution post-TBI remains under-explored), (B) the effects of age at and time since injury, and (C) cognitive impairment severity as a function of injury severity. Such efforts should aim to develop and standardize batteries for cognitive subdomains—rather than only domains—with high ecological validity. Additionally, they should utilize multivariate techniques like factor analysis and related methods to clarify which cognitive subdomains or components are indeed measured by standardized tests.",

The occurrence of psychiatric symptoms in children does not reflect static disease entities, usually, but rather either diseases in process, which become evident in their final state in adulthood, or other social and cultural factors, such as abuse, trauma, and neglect. Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is not a disease in itself, usually, but rather a mistaken diagnosis when distractibility or impulsivity is caused by mood illnesses or anxiety states. Long-term randomized data with amphetamines indicate no greater functional benefit than with psychosocial interventions for ADD. Notable harms exist, including stunted height and possible neurotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "After aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, acute subdural hematoma (SDH) is a rare consequence. SDH has never been linked to an unruptured intracavernous aneurysm. The most serious sort of subdural hematoma is this one. Following a head injury, the symptoms are severe and appear quickly, which can take anywhere from minutes to hours. The pressure on the brain quickly rises as blood accumulates. If you are not diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, you will die., you may lose consciousness, become paralysed, or even die. A subdural haematoma is potentially fatal. A serious head injury that causes blood vessels to burst is a common cause. As Blood can pool as a result, putting pressure on the brain. The effects of age and blood thinning medications, and other factors all raise the risk. as well as alcohol consumption Symptoms such as After a brain injury, symptoms such as headache, confusion, vomiting, slurred speech, or coma may emerge immediately or weeks later. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma may or may not occur. Main symptoms and Important clinical findings: Because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries, the main symptoms of a subdural hematoma appear later than those of an epidural haemorrhage. Acute hematoma signs and symptoms can occur in minutes, if not seconds, but they can also take up to two weeks to appear. Chronic subdural hematomas normally take four to seven weeks to manifest symptoms. The main diagnose, therapeutic intervention and outcomes: A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that frequently necessitates surgery. It's a sort of intracranial haemorrhage that happens behind the dura (basically, an accumulation of the presence of blood on the brain's surface) and can be linked to other brain traumas. Conclusion: The complication of ruptured, large intracavernous aneurysms is acute SDH. The postulated mechanism for the development of SDH is cavernous sinus wall erosion caused by acute aneurysm expansion after thrombosis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this article is to emphasize and summarize pathographies of eminent composers, 77 of them, who were substance abusers. In this section we can divide them into three groups as follows: substance abusers who suffered from primary alcoholism, secondary alcoholism, and those who were alcohol and/or tobacco, drugs abusers. Most of them had different anxiety and depressive disorders (neurosis, panic disorder, cyclothymia, manic depressive disorder).1Substance abuse is the use of alcohol, tobacco and/or illegal drugs in a way that is harmful for health. Most of the composers mentioned in this article were alcohol abusers. Alcoholism is a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, whose sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms - tremor, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions (delirium tremens). Alcoholism impairs intellectual functions, physical skills, memory, judgment and social skills, such as conversation. Heavy consumption or alcohol abuse also causes following complications and diseases of different organs and systems, for example cardiovascular - cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure; nervous system - neuritis, funnicular myelosis, cerebral atrophy; gastrointestinal tract - gastropathy, ulcers, portal hypertension, acute and chronic pancreatitis, enteritis, cirrhosis of the liver etc. There are many substance abusers, but only a few of them (Dussek, Mysliveoek, Mussorgsky etc.) suffered primarily from alcoholism to such extent that their careers were interrupted and stopped because of alcohol abuse. Therefore they were unable to finish their creative work.11 In this journal we previously published pathographies of the following composers: J.C. Bach, W.F. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Debussy, Glinka, Gluck, Handel, Liszt, Mozart, Mussorgsky, Puccini, Ravel, Schonberg, Schubert, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Wolf.COMPOSERS AND RESULTS1. Pietro Marc Antonio Cesti(1623-1669) Italian composer and conductor who was born in Arezzo and studied with various local musicians. In 1637 he joined the Franciscan order. While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, probably due to the patronage of the powerful Medici family. There he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa who wrote librettos for a number of Cesti' s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti' s calling as a monk and his success as a singer and composer of operas were coming into conflict so he was officially reprimanded. In 1652 he became a court member in Innsbruck. After holding a post somewhere in Florence as maestro di cappella, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister in Vienna. He was described as unstable, stubborn, quarrelsome and often seeking confrontation. He had frequent disagreements with other musicians. His frequent changes of living places were caused by his conflicting nature and connected with his alcohol abuse because of which he had problems with the society. His health was impaired because of alcohol abuse, so he died at the age of 46 in Venice as a result of complications of alcoholism, probably poisoned by his rivals in Florence.2-82. Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf(1739-1799) Austrian violinist and composer who was born in Vienna. He was a brilliant musician of great technical skills and soon became a member of the court chapels held by prince Sachsen - Hildburghausen, and later of another held by Bishop Adam Pataoic. Afterwards he was active in Breslau - Wroclaw and again in Vienna. He was a member of the royal orchestra and later a capelmeister in service of Bratislava Duke. He cooperated with J. Haydn and W.A. Mozart extensively. His musical drama »A doctor and a chemist« became very famous and was even compared to Mozart's »Figaro«. He was a master of »Singspiel«; he composed more than forty of them, and comic operas. He led a decadent life, eating and drinking excessively. He was one of the last composers living that kind of life. Later, he suffered from uric arthritis and hemorrhoids, what is more, he became almost paralyzed. …",

The high intensity injuring force creates conditions for occurrence of combinations of different types of damage leading to aggravation of pathological processes caused by trauma, complication of clinical picture, difficulties of diagnosis and treatment, prolongation of hospital stay, and requires an additional methods of research and treating the injured. Finding the genesis of symptoms observed upon neurologic examination, and especially the differential diagnosis between primary and secondary lesions of the brain stem are nessesary to choose the emergency care for victims with severe traumatic brain injury, as well as to forecast the outcomes of treatment. The dynamics of neurological symptoms (level of wakefulness, pupil size, eyeball mobility, muscle tone and limb movement disorders, pathological plantar reflexes) have significant differences in patients with various types of brain damage, which makes a regular assessment of neurological status extremely important in these patients.",

      "title": "Introduction to psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is the branch of medicine which specializes in the treatment of those brain disorders which pri­marily cause disturbance of thought, behaviour, and emotion. These are often referred to as mental, or psy­chiatric, disorders. The boundary with the specialty of neurology, which also deals with disorders of the cen­tral nervous system, is therefore indistinct. Neurology mainly focuses on brain disease with clear physical pathology and/ or obvious peripheral effects on, for ex­ample, motor function. Mental disorders such as depressive disorder and psychoses have been recognized since antiquity. Modern epidemiological studies have demonstrated that they are both highly prevalent and widely dis­tributed across all societies. Overall, mental disorders account for a very high proportion of the disability experienced by the human race (see Chapter 2). Unfortunately, in most societies mental disorders still do not receive the recognition or a level of health ser­vice commensurate with their public health import­ance. There are several reasons for this. Probably most importantly, the brain is a vastly complex organ and the neural systems underlying mental disorders re­main poorly characterized. This inevitably means that our understanding of the pathophysiology is rela­tively poor compared to disorders such as diabetes or heart disease. The absence of a clear body of reliable scientific evidence means that competing unscien­tific views— and stigma— can flourish. Recently, how­ever, our neurobiological techniques have improved in sophistication and sensitivity to the extent that mental disorders have become tractable problems. Phenomena such as mood symptoms, anxiety, and even psychosis seem to exist on a continuum in the population, and the absence of reliable neurobiological measures creates difficulties in determining where the thresholds lie in the gradual change from normality to illness. In clinical practice, the use of diagnostic cri­teria can increase the reliability of diagnoses and re­duce the variations between clinicians. However, small changes in diagnostic criteria can have large effects on the resulting estimates of the prevalence of disorders. Unfortunately, the criteria themselves are based on very imperfect knowledge about the natural history or boundaries of the disorders.",

      "title": "State-Dependent Memory: Neurobiological Advances and Prospects for Translation to Dissociative Amnesia",
      "abstract": "In susceptible individuals, overwhelming traumatic stress often results in severe psychopathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or dissociative disorders. Among other symptoms, these disorders are defined by severe abnormalities of memory processing, manifested either as the uncontrollable emergence of memories (flashbacks) or as an inability to remember events (dissociative amnesia) that are usually, but not necessarily, related to the stressful experience. These memory deficits are believed to be the core source of debilitating psychopathologies such as anxiety, depression, and social dysfunction. The question of why memory for some traumatic experiences is compromised while other comparably traumatic experiences are remembered perfectly well, both within and across individuals, has puzzled clinicians for decades. Whereas much effort has been invested in gaining a better understanding of memory processing in PTSD, the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in dissociative disorders have remained elusive. In this article, we present clinical, cognitive, and neurobiological perspectives on memory research relevant to dissociative amnesia. Given that state-dependence has been a widely accepted conceptual frameworks of memory processing in dissociative amnesia, we focus on this phenomenon by discussing its basic features in humans and proposing how advances in the neurobiology of state-dependent memory gleaned from animal studies could be translated to humans.",

Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

Cognitive functions other than memory, specifically self-awareness, are spared [3]. Marijuana use has been linked to transient global amnesia in some cases [4-6], presumably through the effect of Δ9- Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on the Cannabinoid receptors (CB1) that are located presynaptically in the lipid membranes of neurons, which results in neuromodulation with changing the number of neurochemicals such as glutamergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic systems, all of which end up affecting the memory [7].",

In some there are personal traits of very special nature which cannot be reduced to simpler elements. In the formulation of each case one must take into account the possibility of a disorder at each of many levels. In working at this large group of patients we still require very much more information as to the rôle played by the simple organic functions, while not neglecting the complicated development of elaborate psychological reactions. The detailed analysis of the special determination of the specific psychological reactions has been carried further than the other lines of investigation, owing to the enthusiasm of the psychoanalytic school. There remains much work to be done in regard to the rôle of the various systems (cardio-vascular, gastro-intestinal, etc.) in the setting of the emotional reactions; and the study of the personality along lines analogous to those suggested by Hoch and Amsden is an important field for further research.",

Cognitive symptoms include impairments in attention, information processing efficiency and speed, executive functions, and long-term memory. These cognitive impairments are independent of the disease’s duration and are minimally associated with neurological manifestations. Most MS patients require psychiatric treatment, usually for cognitive or affective disorders. Therapeutic management includes treatment of acute exacerbations, symptomatic treatment, and disease-modifying treatments/biological therapies. This case presentation aims to emphasize the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists when addressing the psychiatric manifestations of MS. Our patient is a 52-year-old man who presented to our clinic with suicidal ideation, a plan and method, depressive mood, multiple delusions, affective inversion towards family members, severe anxiety, and irritability, symptoms that led to significantly diminished functionality. He also presented with neurological symptoms and severe damage to the motor area. MS is a chronic, progressive disease with well-known neurological symptoms. However, the psychiatric manifestations are often overlooked. MS is thought to be an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks the myelin sheath that protects nerve fibers, resulting in inflammation and damage, which eventually leads to a loss of function. The psychiatric manifestations of MS can be just as debilitating as the physical symptoms and can significantly reduce quality of life. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach between specialists in psychiatry and neurology is often necessary to provide the most appropriate medical care for patients.",

      "abstract": "Encephalopathy is evidenced as an altered mental state with various neurological symptoms, such as memory and cognitive problems. The type of a substance-evoked encephalopathy will depend on the drug, substance, or combination being abused. The categories into which we could place the various abused substances could be tentatively divided into stimulants, amphetamines, hallucinogens, narcotics, inhalants, anesthetics, anabolic steroids, and antipsychotics/antidepressants. Other factors that may underlie encephalopathy, such as infectious agents, environmental, and other factors have also to be taken into account. Drugs of abuse can be highly toxic to the CNS following acute, but more so in chronic exposure, and can produce significant damage to other organs, such as the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. The damage to these organs may be at least partially reversible when drug abuse is stopped but CNS damage from repeated or prolonged abuse is often irreversible. The major pathways for the organ and CNS toxicity could be related to ischemic events as well as increased cell damage due to metabolic or mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in increased excitotoxicity, reduced energy production, and lowered antioxidant potential. These susceptibilities could be strengthened by the use of antioxidants to combat free radicals (e.g., vitamin E, lipoic acid); trying to improve energy generation by using mitochondriotropic/metabolic compounds (e.g., thiamine, coenzyme Q10, carnitine, riboflavin); by reducing excitotoxicity (e.g., glutamate antagonists) and other possible strategies, such as robust gene response, need to be investigated further. The drug-abuse-evoked encephalopathy still needs to be studied further to enable better preventative and protective strategies.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

      "abstract": "Os transtornos do humor sao as desordens psiquiatricas mais comuns entre individuos com 60 anos ou mais. Dentre esses, estao a depressao maior, a distimia e os sintomas depressivos clinicamente significativos (SDCS).A sindrome depressiva e caracterizada pela presenca de humor predominantemente depressivo e/ou irritavel e anedonia (diminuicao da capacidade de sentir prazer ou alegria). Existe uma sensacao subjetiva de diminuicao de energia (cansaco, fadiga), desinteresse, lentificacao, pensamentos pessimistas e ideias de ruina. Em geral, esses sintomas sao acompanhados de modificacoes no sono e apetite, prejuizo cognitivo, alteracoes comportamentais e sintomas fisicos. Podem ocorrer delirios ou alucinacoes congruentes com o humor como delirios de culpabilidade excessiva ou de saude muito ruim, delirios de pobreza ou persecutorios; as alucinacoes sao menos comuns, mas podem aparecer e tendem a ser visuais ou olfatorias. Os profissionais da saude que lidam com este grupo etario devem ficar atentos aos sintomas depressivos mascarados, como dores inespecificas, adinamia, insonia, perda de peso e queixas subjetivas de perda da memoria, evitando imputar estas queixas ao envelhecimento pois os tratamentos disponiveis melhoram muito os sintomas e a qualidade de vida dos individuos acometidos.",

Estas se definen como un grupo de padecimientos de origen en muchos casos desconocido y que tienen como atributo común el curso progresivo de los síntomas derivados del daño estructural y funcional de diferentes zonas del sistema nervioso. La Demencia o Trastorno Cognitivo, ocurre cuando el cerebro se afecta por una enfermedad o afección específica que causa deterioro cognitivo. La secuencia en el espectro de la demencia puede terminar en la forma más grave de la enfermedad. El deterioro cognitivo en muchos casos transita desde el leve, referido a una disminución de la función cognitiva mayor de lo esperado por la edad y al nivel de educación del individuo, pero sin interferir con sus actividades cotidianas. El diagnóstico temprano de la enfermedad y la asunción de tratamientos y sobre todo estilos de vida saludables, puede evitar o enlentecer el tránsito hacia la gravedad de la enfermedad y por ende mejorar la calidad de vida. Con el objetivo de contribuir a este propósito se diseñó una herramienta de software denominada Neuromap que permite obtener patrones de conectividad a partir de señales de EEG y realizar una prueba de profundidad de la demencia. De esta forma se enriquecen los instrumentos con que cuentan en la actualidad los especialistas de las ciencias médicas para obtener un mejor y más eficaz diagnóstico.

      "title": "SINTOMAS DEPRESSIVOS EM ACADÊMICOS DE UMA UNIVERSIDADE PÚBLICA NO OESTE DO ESTADO DO PARÁ, RELATO DE EXPERIÊNCIA",
      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A depressao e um disturbio do afeto e/ou do humor, que e caracterizado por sintomas como, piora do sono, do apetite, da auto-estima, pela tristeza, sentimento de culpa, entre outros. O individuo depressivo tem dificuldade em descrever experiencias emocionais positivas, sendo pouco aberto a sentimentos otimistas. Alem disso, na depressao nao existe apenas queixa de tristeza, mas tambem ha mudancas de humor que culminam em crises frequentes de explosao de raiva, que levam ao desgaste da saude fisica e emocional, prejuizos no convivio social, na aprendizagem e ideias e/ou tentativas frequentes de suicidio. Esse transtorno e considerado uma pandemia e a terceira maior causa a nivel global de doencas. Sao inumeros os fatores que podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento da depressao, como por exemplo, o baixo suporte social, a presenca de eventos estressantes, pensamentos negativos, problemas financeiros, entre outros. Alguns dados encontrados nos universitarios nesta pesquisa, sao considerados elevados, no que tange ao processo depressivo, e ganham maior destaque ainda quando comparados com a populacao em geral. Isso e possivel, pois e nessa fase academica que se exige muito esforco do adolescente ou jovem adulto, onde o mesmo deve aprender a lidar com uma gama de responsabilidades que estarao presentes em sua vida futura, tanto como academico, quanto como profissional. Estes incluem a adaptacao de cumprimento de prazos e horarios, a distância dos pais e demais familiares, a falta de motivacao para os estudos, dentre outros conflitos internos e/ou externos. Diante dessas informacoes, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em relatar a presenca de sinais e sintomas depressivos encontrados em academicos de uma instituicao de ensino superior em Santarem- PA, atraves de uma escuta qualificada. Desenvolvimento : Este estudo trata-se de um relato de experiencia acerca das vivencias durante uma acao em saude que ocorreu no dia 24 de abril de 2017 desenvolvida por academicos de enfermagem da Universidade do Estado do Para (UEPA) Campus XII-Santarem, a acao foi baseada na metodologia ativa da problematizacao segundo o Projeto Politico Pedagogico (PPP) do curso de enfermagem da UEPA para a Atividade Integrada em Saude que e um momento em que o academico de enfermagem integra todos os eixos da grade curricular do semestre, escolhendo assim um tema a ser abordado, assim como o publico, que foi composto de academicos dos cursos contemplados na universidade: enfermagem, musica, educacao fisica, medicina e fisioterapia. A tematica foi abordada atraves de acao educativa em saude, organizada pelos academicos do curso de enfermagem com diversos topicos como: alimentacao, avaliacao de risco para o desenvolvimento de doencas cronicas, avaliacao de medidas antropometricas e, nesta atividade, avaliacao da saude mental com a investigacao da existencia de sintomas depressivos. Durante a acao os academicos de enfermagem, em um primeiro momento, distribuiram folders contendo informacoes sobre a depressao e, posteriormente conversaram individualmente com cada academico que, de forma voluntaria, concordaram discutir sobre sintomas que, de acordo com o CID-10, poderiam estar sentindo. Durante a conversa os sintomas investigados foram: fadiga aumentada ou perda de energia fisica e mental, perda de interesse e prazer, classificados como sintomas fundamentais; apetite diminuido, atividade diminuida, auto-estima e autoconfianca diminuida, concentracao e atencao diminuida, sentimento de culpa e inutilidade, pensamentos e/ou atos lesivos ou suicidas, sono perturbado, visao pessimista do futuro, classificados como sintomas episodicos. Alem disso, a acao contou com a ajuda de um psicologo que atendeu os participantes que apresentaram sintomas graves da depressao. Os participantes que apresentaram maior necessidade foram orientados a buscar tratamento efetivo com intervencao de psicologo. Resultados : A maioria dos entrevistados mostraram-se bastante interessados no assunto e nao demonstravam muita timidez, apresentaram-se bem a vontade e com disposicao para dialogar, o que de certa forma surpreendeu a equipe, que esperava uma resistencia por parte dos academicos, com isso observou-se facilitacao do trabalho para a equipe dos entrevistadores. Apos a entrevista, os academicos de enfermagem, organizadores da acao, detectaram uma alta incidencia de sintomas fundamentais e episodicos em um numero significativos dos universitarios, o que pode ser considerado uma situacao preocupante. No decorrer da acao, muitos academicos participantes, relataram o quanto consideravam acoes desse genero, importantes na universidade, por sentirem-se sobrecarregados pelas atividades academicas, desorientados, desanimados e com pensamentos pessimistas. Podem ser classificados como poucas as acoes voltadas para os academicos, sobretudo, os academicos da area da saude, ja que eles sao os principais responsaveis por promoverem esse tipo de acoes e que acabam deixando de se cuidar, nao lembrando-se que tambem precisam de cuidado e atencao. Deste modo, e inegavel a grande satisfacao de poder contribuir de alguma forma para esta comunidade e acredita-se que, todos os academicos tiveram uma boa oportunidade de serem ouvidos de forma mais qualificada por um profissional apto a lhe dar orientacoes essenciais que visem a prevencao diagnostica, alem de recuperacao e promocao da saude mental. Consideracoes Finais : Apos a acao em saude, alguns academicos que se ausentaram no dia em que a acao ocorreu procuraram a equipe afim de, saberem se haveria outra acao semelhante, alegando que gostariam de serem ouvidos ou ate mesmo referindo interesse de um amigo (a) na consulta psicologica. Essa experiencia aponta para a necessidade de que academicos na area da saude devem cuidar da saude mental de forma frequente sem negligenciar as tensoes e o estresse advindos da propria universidade, antes de serem lancados no mercado de trabalho. Alem da necessidade de acompanhamento psicologico para os academicos nas proprias universidades, sejam elas publicas ou privadas, no decorrer da formacao afim de manter a saude mental e de prevenir, diagnosticar ou ainda tratar quadros depressivos e outras doencas mentais que podem comprometer seu rendimento academico e a sua saude geral, visando reduzir dados crescentes relacionados a sintomatologia da depressao em universitarios. Essa experiencia mostrou que mesmo em cursos da area da saude, a saude mental ainda e pouco debatida, precisando assim, de uma atencao tanto dos academicos com sua propria saude, como da instituicao de ensino, promovendo um espaco e profissionais capacitados que possam auxiliar enquanto o academico estiver em formacao.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "abstract": "Delirium can be conceptualized as an acute decline in cognitive function that typically lasts from hours to a few days. Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

The causes include 1) low systemic BP (arrhythmias, valvular disease, medications, reflex causes); 2) reduced cerebral blood flow (cerebral vasospasm, hyperventilation); and 3) Miscellaneous causes of cerebral dysfunction (metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte abnormalities). Most cardiology referrals for autonomic function testing are for near-syncope, syncope, or palpitations. The focus of this chapter will be limited to autonomic function assessment as related to cardiology, specifically the evaluation of a patient referred for syncope.",

Studies on job stress have revealed that lately this problem or condition has greatly affected people who work as workers; since the consequences of suffering stress from work are sufficient, they are also serious and in some cases difficult to manage. Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor. Be very careful, because if it can be avoided they can cause fatal damage to humans or even cause death.",

      "abstract": "Transient recurrent confusional and stuporous states of nonepileptic origin are clearly less frequent than epileptic ones. They are relatively common in diseases of disturbed vigilance, like narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnolence, and sleep apnea. These patients often suffer from attacks of hypovigilance, characterized by altered awareness, automatic behaviour and partial or complete amnesia for the attack. Because of the memory 'black outs' and the frequently associated hypnagogic hallucinations, the patients behave inappropriately and often appear confused. Confusional states also typically arise during basilar artery migraine attacks. This special form of complicated migraine predominantly affects young females and is characterized by symptoms and signs of brain stem dysfunction such as vertigo, ataxia, paresthesia, limb weakness, dysarthria; in 75% of the cases, disorders of consciousness dominate. Transient ischemic attacks are sometimes recurrent and, when involving the cranial basilar territory, may result in confusional states without significant motor dysfunction. Attacks of transient global amnesia are possibly also ischemic in nature and are assumed to arise from transient bilateral limbic failure. Affecting only memory functions, they are strictly spoken not confusional, but must nevertheless be taken into consideration when proper observation during the attack was not possible.",

Effective treatment always depends on making as precise a diagnosis as possible (e.g. pharmacological management of nausea and vomiting is guided by the presumed mechanism). Symptoms can also herald an emergency (e.g. sepsis, delirium, spinal cord compression), when the patient’s frailty, likely prognosis, and own values and wishes need to be taken into account in planning management.

Demographic factors, especially those revealing changing social status, recent loss, intentionality, lethality, past history, and high-risk groups, can be rapidly assessed. Viewing suicide as a final common pathway of system dysfunction at any or all major levels-biologic, psychologic, sociocultural-leads to an appreciation of the ubiquitous nature of passive or active \"self murder\" impulses. Persons depressed for any significant length of time for whatever reasons are potentially suicidal. Thus, the \"typical\" depression is suicidal but so are persons whose depression is related to drug side effects, primary illness effects, to living in a dysfunctional family system, or to normal grief. Diagnosis requires inquiry about the depth of the patient's depression pain. Treatment takes into account the aforementioned risk factors, plus interventions appropriate to the malfunctioning system.",

Primary impairment of episodic memory often results in reduced semantic and autobiographic memory. Neuropsychological performance predicts academic achievement and everyday life functioning while subjective memory complaints are highly correlated with depression. Memory impairment is also influenced by initial brain damage, developmental retardation and dynamic factors (e.g., seizure frequency, medication). Damage of functional tissue, low mental reserve capacity, and poor seizure outcome increase the risk for postsurgical memory impairment whereas functional release due to seizure freedom counteracts negative impact. Preliminary findings indicate that postsurgical training improves memory deficits and encourage further research.",

Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

Other biologic causes include anoxia at birth, other obstetric difficulties, as well as a relatively few postnatal events, such as sequelae of central nervous system infection or injury, anoxia from repeated or prolonged convulsions, and a variety of other causes including degenerative diseases (such as Tay-Sachs) and toxic encephalopathies (such as lead poisoning).

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

This narrative review focuses on the main clinical presentations of cognitive and psychological problems ('mind injuries') that occur postoperatively in absence of ascertainable focal neurologic deficits, exploring their pathophysiological mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention and treatment. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a potentially devastating complication that can involve several mechanisms and several predisposing, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors, which can result in or be associated to cerebral microvascular damage. Postoperative depression is influenced by genetic or psychosocial predisposing factors, by neuroendocrine activation, and by the release of several pro-inflammatory factors. The net effect of these changes is neuroinflammation. These complex biochemical alterations, along with an aspecific response to stressful life events, might target the function of several brain areas, which are thought to represent a trigger factor for the onset of depression.",

      "title": "Seizures And Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

In other instances, especially when the discharges are more atypical, the psychic disturbances may take on the character of either a simple worsening of behavior or of a confusional state with agitation and delirium, or of a stuporous state. The temporal lobe statuses, which are much more rare, manifest themselves either as a succession of psychomotor attacks, or as protracted confusional or confusooneiric episodes. An EEG makes it possible, at any rate, to differentiate between the petit mal statuses and the temporal lobe statuses. RÉSUMÉ Les états 'absence, qui cliniquement se manifestent par une simple obnubilation de la conscience, ne constituent qu'une partie des troubles psychiques qui accompagnent les décharges généralises et prolongées de complexes pointe‐onde. Dans 'autres cas, et en particulier quand les décharges sont plus atypiques, les manifestations psychiques peuvent revêtir 'aspect 'un simple trouble du comportement, ou 'un état confusionnel avec agitation et onirisme, ou encore 'aspect 'un état de stupeur.

These include aphasia (dominant hemisphere), memory loss (hippocampal involvement), and poststroke depression (left hemisphere more likely than right; anterior more likely than posterior). Changes in global, nonfocal psychological categories, such as self-identity and personality, are not typically observed or addressed in the stroke's early stages. However, an analysis of medically naive discourse about stroke suggests that patients and observers conceptualize and internalize three important, long-term psychological sequelae of stroke: (1) the dehumanization of the patient, (2) the onset of senescence, and (3) the decline of intelligence. These psychological sequelae represent changes in the otherwise more enduring features of psychological structure. They are part of the disease burden of stroke and need to be addressed in long-term rehabilitation programs.",

Häufig wird in den Lehrbüchern hier lapidar auf neurotoxische Schäden des Alkoholismus oder Mangelzustände verwiesen. In Teilbereichen ist die Forschung aber heute schon weiter. Im Vortrag wird ein kurzer Überblick über die wichtigsten neuropsychiatrischen Folgeschäden bei Alkoholismus gegeben und einige aktuelle Befunde zu Pathophysiologie und Therapie mitgeteilt. Eines der thematisierten Krankheitsbilder betrifft dabei die Alkoholhalluzinose, eine eher seltene Störung, bei denen der Alkoholkranke an akustischen Halluzinationen, gelegentlich auch paranoiden Symptomen oder Bewusstseins- und Orientierungsstörungen leidet. Trotz phänomenologischer Ähnlichkeit besteht offensichtlich keine genetische Verbindung zur Schizophrenie. Kasuistische Beobachtungen aus der Bildgebung haben gezeigt, dass bei Patienten mit Alkoholhalluzinose häufig eine Hypofunktion des Thalamus vorliegt, ähnlich wie bei schizophrenen Erkrankungen. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt des Vortrages wird das Wernicke-Korsakow-Syndrom sein, für das bislang keine ausreichenden Therapiemöglichkeiten bestehen.",

These include analgesics, anaesthesia required for surgery, and the development of acute or post-traumatic stress disorder. This is relevant in clinical and medicolegal settings. Repeated assessments of the post-injury state, involving tests for continuing amnesia, risk promoting recall of events suggested by the examiner, or generating confabulations. The PTA syndrome affects the categorical autobiographical memory, and is accompanied by confusion as an essential component; this should be suspected from the initial or early Glasgow Coma Scale score (13–14/15) if not directly recorded by clinical staff. PTA by itself is only one of several indices of severity of TBI. The nature of the head injury, including observers' accounts, clinical and neuroimaging data, the possible role of other external injuries, blood loss, acute stress disorder and the potential for hypoxic brain injury, must be taken into account as well as concomitant alcohol or substance abuse, and systemic shock. A plausible mechanism for a TBI must be demonstrable, and other causes of amnesia excluded.",

Revisão bibliográfica: O TEPT é uma doença psicológica que pode surgir depois que uma pessoa experimenta um ou mais eventos traumáticos, como combate militar, trauma físico devido a lesão ou outros acidentes, como violência doméstica, estupro, trauma de infância, negligência ou abuso. Este se manifesta com sintomas dramáticos de hiperexcitação, lembranças memoriais intrusivas, pesadelos e flashbacks somatossensoriais. É frequentemente acompanhado por comorbidades psiquiátricas, como depressão, abuso de substâncias ou transtornos de ansiedade, o que leva a um alto nível de incapacidade funcional. Considerações finais: O TEPT consiste no desenvolvimento de sintomas relacionados ao estressor após um ou mais eventos traumáticos. Seus sintomas geralmente são classificados em três grupos: intrusão, evitação, e excitação com efeitos preponderantes no sono com insônia e pesadelo. O tratamento farmacológico é feito com Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Serotonina ou Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Norepinefrina, cujos efeitos colaterais são bem tolerados. Nesse sentido, é essencial um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento multidisciplinar com um médico psiquiatra e um psicólogo a fim de minimizar os impactos do transtorno.",

In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

Although symptomatology of autism may be noticed around early months, diagnosis generally occurs around 24-36 months, however in some cases diagnosis may be delayed to adulthood [1]. Since behavioural symptoms and the degree of functional impairment are variable, the au‐ tistic disorder is described as a heterogenous symptom cluster of varying etiological and pathological basis [2]. Described as a multifactorial disorder created by interaction of neuro‐ logic, immunologic, environmental, and genetic factors, autistic disorder has no definite cause [3, 4]. In many cases in whom the etiology remains unclear are diagnosed as idiopath‐ ic autism or non-syndromic autism [5, 6]. Seventy percent of cases with idiopathic autism have basic symptoms without physical abnormalities whereas 30% have complex autism in which dysmorphic features are detected such as microcephaly and/or structural brain mal‐ formations [7]. Autism is associated with other syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome, Down Syndrome, and tuberosclerosis in 5-25% of the cases ([8, 9]. Although phenotypic het‐ erogeneity is the biggest challenge for research efforts directed to identify autism etiology [10], currently it is widely accepted that environmental and genetic factors play essential role in genesis of autistic disorder thanks to a recent advance in research techniques related to biological factors and widespread studies in this field [11, 12].",

Frontotemporal dementia is a group of clinical syndromes, divided in Behavioral-variant, characterized by disinhibition, compulsions, apathy, aberrant sexual behavior and executive dysfunction; and Primary Progressive Aphasia, which is subdivided in Nonfluentvariant and Semantic-variant. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a reversible cause of dementia, with a wide clinical feature, that includes psychiatric symptoms such as depression and irritability, hematological symptoms related to anemia (e.g. dyspnea and fatigue), and neurological symptoms including dementia and neuropathy. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is also reversible, presenting forgetfulness, changes in mood, decline of executive functions, reduced attention, and a lack of interest in daily activities as symptoms. The radiological findings vary depending on the etiology of dementia. For that reason, understanding neuroimaging and clinical aspects is important to diagnose effectively",

      "abstract": "Alexithymic phenomena may result from a variety of psychological sources. Psychoanalytic observation of psychosomatic patients (and others as well) reveals that the inability to name, recognize, contain or work through one's affective states is frequently one manifestation of defensive structures of a psychotic kind (more radical than denial which deals with certain neurotic anxieties). Such massive defense has been created as a bulwark against various dangers, such as (1) psychotic anxieties (fear of mental or physical fragmentation; loss of identity-feeling; danger of uncontrollable, explosive action); (2) profound perturbation concerning the narcissistic self-image and its fluctuations, and (3) pathological formation of the ego-ideal structure concerning affective experience. All of these may contribute to the creation of alexithymic defects.",

Die Pathogenese ist letztendlich unbekannt; wahrscheinlich handelt es sich um ein Syndrom mit verschiedenen Ursachen. Sekundäre Mechanismen wie Schlafstörungen, eine Anämie oder eine Schilddrüsenfunktionsstörung, aber auch Depressionen und kognitive Störungen müssen von der Fatigue im engeren Sinn (primäre Fatigue) abgegrenzt werden. Die subjektive Dimension der Fatigue kann mit standardisierten Fragebogen erfasst werden. Da sich zumindest ein Teil der Symptomatik mit einer Aufmerksamkeitsstörung erklärt lässt, kann mittlerweile die Fatigue mit einer Aufmerksamkeitstestung (Subtest „Alertness” aus der Testbatterie zur Aufmerksamkeitsprüfung) objektiviert werden. Die medikamentöse Therapie mit z. B. Amantadin oder Modafinil stellt in Einzelfällen eine Option dar, ist aber oftmals nicht bzw. nicht anhaltend erfolgreich. Daher besteht das Behandlungskonzept vor allem aus nicht medikamentösen Maßnahmen wie Beratung von Patienten und Angehörigen, Strukturierung des Tagesablaufs mit der Möglichkeit zu ausreichenden Pausen, Vermittlung von",

The four major intentional deficits that can be associated with neglect include, akinesia (body part, directional and hemispatial), impersistence, defective response inhibition and motor perseveration.

      "title": "Clinical Update: Grip Strength: An Uncommon Impairment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Upper extremity impairment rarely is assessed using grip strength, according to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), because results can be influenced by subjective factors that are difficult to control, including sex, age, comorbidities, fatigue, handedness, time of day, pain, and the individual's cooperation. The AMA Guides, Section 16.5b, Impairment Evaluation Methods, discusses the approach used for rating peripheral nerve injuries, but this section applies only to specific nerve lesions with resulting weakness of the muscles supplied or sensory changes. Strength correlates only poorly with performance of the activities of daily living, and grip strength testing using a dynamometer or other types of isometric strength testing has not been shown to reliably discriminate between submaximal and maximal efforts. Grip strength usually is not used in the presence of decreased motion, painful conditions, deformities, or absence of body parts (eg, missing digit), nor is it used to rate weakness from a peripheral nerve lesion. In rare cases, the AMA Guides allows the use of loss of strength (eg, due to a severe muscle tear that healed leaving a palpable muscle defect). Impairment ratings based on objective anatomic findings take precedence, and loss of strength is rarely combined and only if based on unrelated etiologic or pathomechanical causes.",

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "title": "Main neuroendocrine features and therapy in primary sleep troubles.",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a sleep trouble in which the patient has difficulties in falling or in staying asleep. There are patients who fall asleep easily, but wake up too early; others have troubles in falling asleep and a third category has troubles with both falling and staying asleep. Independent of the type of insomnia, the final result is a poor-quality sleep, responsible for depressive or irritable mood, loss in concentration, learning and memory capacities. Sleep is essential to emotional and physical health. Inadequate sleep over a period of time is increasing the risks for obesity, diabetes, heart disease and depression. People suffering of chronic insomnia show an increased predisposition for psychiatric problems. People who had sleep troubles reported impaired ability to fulfill tasks involving memory, learning, logical reasoning and mathematical operations. New studies show that insomnia might be a result of the decrease of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurochemical responsible for the decrease of activity in many brain areas. Lower brain GABA levels were also found in people with major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. Hypnotics, such as benzodiazepines are acting increasing the activity of the GABA neurons. Exposure to stress is associated with a greater risk for insomnia, with individual differences. Stress activates the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Increased activity of HPA axis is stimulating the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone, further inducing sleep disruption. Insomnia is also associated with depression and anxiety disorders, in which the HPA axis is characteristically overactive. People who show predisposition to sleep troubles have a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system, they are usually suffering from hyperarousal and they have a more intense response to stressful events. Primary sleep troubles (insomnia) has no apparent causes, is lasting more than one month, and is affecting approximately a quarter of the adult population. Secondary insomnia is associated with chronic heart and/or lung diseases, medication which interfere with onset or duration of sleep, constant change of the sleep habits, restless leg syndrome, etc. Besides lifestyle changes and cogn itive-behavioral therapy, in the treatment of insomnia are used hypnotic medicines, advised to be prescribed on short-term cures of one or two weeks. Benzodiazepines are inducing and maintaining sleep. Longer use is responsible for severe side effects--dependency and withdrawal syndrome, daytime drowsiness and dizziness, low blood pressure, memory troubles and change in the melatonin secretion during night-time period. For these reasons were created non-benzodiazepines hypnotics--zolpidem, zaleplon, which are as effective as benzodiazepines, but have fewer side effects. Nevertheless the use of these hypnotics is also restricted to 7-10 days. Zopiclone (Imovane) another short-acting non-benzodiazepine hypnotic has a different chemical structure, but a pharmacologic profile similar to that of the benzod iazepines; the treatment should be of maximum four weeks. Besides generally known concerns related to the use of hypnotics (residual sedative effects, memory impairment, rebound insomnia, abuse, dose escalation, dependency and withdrawal problems) it was signaled a risk of death associated with the use of current hypnotic medications.",

      "abstract": "Brain function relies on efficient coordinated neuronal network activity.Neuronal cross talk and cerebral connectivity is fragile and occurs within tight metabolic and biochemical ranges.Breakdown in brain network dynamics by stressors that hamper cerebral metabolism or neuron neurophysiology led to \"Acute Brain Failure\" syndromes (ABF) [1].ABF, under stressful event, is more likely to happen in individuals with baseline low brain resilience due to previous insults such as pre-existing neurodegenerative disorders, stroke or systemic comorbid conditions, similarly to acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure [2].According to the context, ABF may manifest clinically as Altered Mental State (AMS), delirium or worsening of, already impaired, neurological function.Although such model sets a good framework for the understanding of ABF, it does not provide pathophysiological mechanisms and therefore often confines the therapeutic interventions to symptomatic treatment.Precipitating factors of ABF such as electrolytic imbalances, hypo-glycemia, drug withdrawal, infection… are also known precipitating factors of epileptic activity and could represent one of the missing links between acute brain stressful events and ABF [3].The aim of our studies was to assess the role of Interictal Epileptic Discharges (IED), Periodic Discharges (PDs) and Non-Convulsive Seizures (NCSz) in relationship to ABF in several different acute brain insults.Indeed, IED are generally thought to be asymptomatic but dedicated studies showed alterations of cognitive functions related to IED in both children [4][5][6] and adults [7,8] as well as brain network functional connectivity impairments [9][10][11][12].Similarly, manifestations of PDs and NCSz range from subtle cognitive disturbances, with abnormal behaviour, mood changes, and higher function impairment to clouding of consciousness and unresponsiveness [13][14][15].Epileptic activities, even IED [16][17][18], also increase brain metabolic rate, a phenomenon that can lead to a \"metabolic crisis\" and ABF in situations where the brain metabolism is already fragilized by acute stressors [19][20].Our hypothesis was, thus, that IED, PDs and/or NCSz triggered by acute medical conditions could participate in ABF onset and perpetuation.We first focused on (i) broad-spectrum antibiotherapy in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), then on (ii) delirium on older individuals and finally on (iii) Early Neurological Degradation (END) after ischemic stroke.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

People who have been traumatized often present with distressing and frequently intractable psychosomatic symptoms, often without knowing consciously that the source of their symptoms is the trauma they experienced. The stress response may be considered to exist along a continuum: eustress, stress, and traumatic stress. Traumatic stress precipitates a condition of physiological and psychobiological imbalance in the nervous system and in the endocrine, immune, and neuropeptide systems. Some evidence suggests that discrimination may constitute a stressor and contribute to a greater lifetime allostatic load. Conversely, social relationships mitigate the effects of allostatic load. This intersects with a new model of stress response called \"tend and befriend.\" Learned helplessness intersects with the central assertion of state-dependent memory, learning, and behavior: what we learn and remember is dependent on our psychophysiological state at the time of the experience.",

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacological concerns need epidemiological elucidation\n\nPatients with depressive disorders could be more liable to accidents than others for several reasons. These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

Quienes han pasado por circunstancias vitales adversas (desempleo, luto, traumatismos psicologicos) tienen mas probabilidades de sufrir depresion. A su vez puede generar mas estres y disfuncion, empeorar la situacion vital de la persona afectada. (OMS, 2017). La depresion puede llegar a hacerse cronica o recurrente y dificultar sensiblemente el desempeno en el trabajo o la escuela y la capacidad para afrontar la vida diaria. La posibilidad diagnostica de un trastorno depresivo a partir de datos observacionales poco especificos: deterioro en la apariencia y aspecto personal, lentitud en los movimientos, marcha cansina, tono de voz bajo, facies tristes o poco expresivas, llanto facil o espontaneo en la consulta, escasa concentracion durante la entrevista, verbalizacion de idealizacion pesimista, quejas hipocondriacas, alteraciones en el ritmo del sueno, quejas somaticas difusas y dificiles de encuadrar. (Alberdi Sadupe, Taboada, & Vazquez , 2006).\r\nEn su forma mas grave, puede conducir al suicidio, si es leve, se puede tratar sin necesidad de tratamiento farmacologico, pero cuando tiene caracter moderado o grave se pueden necesitar farmacos y psicoterapia profesional.

      "abstract": "La Esclerosis Multiple es una enfermedad neurologica clinicamente heterogenea donde los sintomas son producidos por mecanismos patogenicos inmunes en relacion a la inflamacion del Sistema Nervioso Central , desmielinizacion y degeneracion axonal, la causa es todavia desconocida. Afecta sobre todo a pacientes adultos jovenes en pleno desarrollo de sus actividades sociales, laborales y familiares, por lo que alteraciones en las funciones superiores cobran, si cabe, mayor importancia al interferir notablemente en la calidad de vida de los pacientes y de su entorno. El deterioro cognitivo severo es poco frecuente dentro de la enfermedad, los ultimos estudios hablan de menos del 5%. Sin embargo la presencia de DC ya en etapas iniciales de la enfermedad objetivado con diferentes test es de entre el 40 al 70% de los pacientes. El patron cognitivo muestra alteraciones en el razonamiento abstracto, problemas de atencion, velocidad de procesamiento de informacion y deficit de memoria reciente. El grado de deterioro se ha relacionado con la carga lesional y atrofia cerebral en resonancia magnetica , el tiempo de evolucion de la enfermedad, el grado de discapacidad y se ha implicado tanto a sustancia blanca como a sustancia gris . Otros factores que pueden incidir en el rendimiento cognitivo de estos pacientes pueden ser la depresion y la fatiga, sintomas frecuentes en pacientes con EM. La homocisteina es un aminoacido que se sintetiza en el organismo a partir de la metionina, se ha demostrado que su nivel aumentado en plasma es un factor de riesgo independiente de ateroesclerosis y de enfermedad tromboembolica. Su aumento se produce principalmente por alteraciones geneticas en las enzimas encargadas de su produccion o bien por factores dieteticos. En los ultimos anos se ha investigado su posible relacion con el DC en varias enfermedades neurologicas como en la Enfermedad de Alzheimer o en la Enfermedad de Parkinson dado su efecto toxico a nivel de SNC a diferentes niveles de actuacion. En la EM tambien hay hallazgos que encuentran una posible relacion entre hiperhomocisteinemia y mayor grado de DC en estos pacientes. Parece interesante profundizar en dicha linea, dada la importancia del DC y su influencia en la calidad de vida de los pacientes .A partir de los resultados obtenidos en el estudio en las diferentes pruebas aplicadas y del posterior analisis estadistico realizado, podemos concluir: En nuestra muestra no se ha demostrado que pacientes con Esclerosis Multiple y Deterioro Cognitivo asocien niveles elevados de homocisteina. No se ha hallado ningun dominio cognitivo especifico afectado asociado a hiperhomocisteinemia. La fatiga y la depresion no se muestran como factores asociados al Deterioro Cognitivo. El 67 % de los pacientes han presentado Deterioro Cognitivo. Los dominios que se han visto mas afectados han sido la velocidad de procesamiento de informacion y la atencion. El test mas sensible para la deteccion de Deterioro Cognitivo en pacientes con Esclerosis Multiple ha resultado el Symbol Digit Modalities Test. No se han encontrado diferencias en cuanto a presencia de Deterioro Cognitivo entre pacientes con Esclerosis Multiple y Sindrome Clinico Aislado. Se ha asociado el Deterioro Cognitivo a mayor edad, menor nivel de estudios, formas progresivas de la Esclerosis Multiple, mayor tiempo de evolucion de la enfermedad y discapacidad medida por la EDSS.",

Classical physics, anchored in materialist reductionism, offered adequate descriptions of everyday mechanics but ultimately proved insufficient for describing the mechanics of extremely high speeds or small sizes, and was supplemented a century ago by quantum physics. Materialist psychology, modeled on the reductionism of classical physics, likewise offered adequate descriptions of everyday mental functioning but ultimately proved insufficient for describing mentation under extreme conditions, such as the continuation of mental function when the brain is inactive or impaired, such as occurs near death.",

Somatization may be associated with numerous psychic disorders. It may, however, also be a question of a somatoform disorder having a physical symptom picture. Somatization disorder is one of the somatoform disorders. Recognition of the disorder is often the problem in its treatment. Establishing a long-term treatment relationship actually forms the basis for therapy.",

The hippocampal type is characterized by relatively short retrograde amnesia and preserved insight into his own amnesic trouble. Persistent amnesia is always associated with bilateral lesion. The diencephalon type usually shows longer retrograde amnesia and poor insight. Unilateral lesion is usually modal in deficit, i.e. verbal in the left and non-verbal in the right, and lacks clear evidence of retrograde amnesia. Responsible locus within the thalamus is still controversial. Our experience point to the mammilothalamic tract. The basal forebrain type is characterized by disorganized and confused recollection of the memorized items. Cued recall is fair compared to voluntary recall. Two special types of amnesic syndrome, i.e. transient global amnesia and isolated focal retrograde amnesia are also important clinical entities, although their etiologies and responsible lesions are not clear yet.",

How far this is true in all cases has not been determined, but there can be no question that crime is often committed without a conscious knowledge or memory of the act at the time. It is well known to students of mental science, that in certain unknown brain states memory is palsied, and fails to note the events of life and surroundings. Like the somnambulist, the person may seem to realize his surroundings and be conscious of his acts, and later be unable to recall anything which has happened. These blanks of memory occur in many disordered states of the brain and body, but are usually of such short duration as not to attract attention. Sometimes events that occur in",

The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "title": "Depresija kao javnozdravstveni problem",
      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

In order to distinguish these possibilities, clinicians need to be aware of typical age-related changes in neurological signs.

In the sensorimotor examination, typical motor changes include distal muscle wasting and weakness, with diminution or loss of distal reflexes and loss of distal vibratory sensibility and sometimes other modalities such as pain and proprioception. However, not all older individuals show such changes, perhaps reflecting 'successful' or 'optimal', as opposed to 'normal', ageing.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

Nerves injuries are caused by car and labor accidents, by cutting and penetrating objects, crushing, fractures, stretching and gunshot wound, professional or amateur sportsmen injuries. Chronic post-surgical pain is a major clinical problem. Incidence of chronic post-surgical pain varies depending on the type of surgery and surgical technique – after limb amputation, thoracotomy, mastectomy, hysterectomy, hip arthroplasty, cholecystectomy, colectomy, vasectomy, Cesarean section. Such pain can transform into persistent, severe and refractory chronic neuropathic pain, which is a serious social problem because it often affects the most productive population, sometimes causing disability, have a high level of comorbidity in the form of psychopathological conditions, sleep disorders. The pathophysiology and neurotransmission of neuropathic pain have complex and not fully understood mechanisms. They involve produce local and systemic signal pain cytokines, disturbances in the modulation of sensory flows, peripheral and central sensitization, neurotransmitter imbalance, changes in gene expression and implicate of the limbic system and hypothalamus contribute to the modulation of mood and behavior. Options for managing neuropathic pain with nerve damage include a limited number of pharmacological drugs and interventional treatment methods. Main drugs used in relief in neuropathic pain include tricyclics antidepressants and dual norepinephrine/5 hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids – gabapentin and pregabalin, capsaicin, opioid analgesics, especially tramadol and methadone are recommended as second line drugs. For patient’s refractory to pharmacotherapy, neurosurgical decompression and nerve reconstruction and neuromodulation procedures are recommended to relieve neuropathic pain.

      "abstract": "<b>Abstract:</b> The awareness of one9s self as a unique sentient agent might be thought of as fundamental to mental health. Though disrupted in most if not all psychiatric disorders, it is the hallmark of depersonalisation disorder. This is a non-psychotic condition in which sufferers feel themselves to be “unreal” in some way and that their experience of the world is also unreal. Evidence suggests that part of the problem may be due to suppression of physiological arousal especially in response to emotion, which interrupts the experience of a vital sense of self, and that this maps on to lateral prefrontal and insula systems. Insight in neuropsychiatry may be thought of as a particular kind of self-awareness involving the appraisal and judgement on whether one9s functions or experiences are pathological in some way. A midline cortical system has been identified as critical for self-appraisal. Lack of awareness of illness or deficits has been studied in patients with for example: schizophrenia, Alzheimer9s disease and brain injury. Unawareness may apply to several domains such as social behaviour, psychopathology, memory and executive function and can be measured by different methods including discrepancy scores between patients9 own and others9 ratings. Our research has shown that patient groups with varying levels of deficit in each domain show varying levels of awareness. Low mood and executive impairment is associated with lack of insight in all groups while insight into memory deficits is closely tied to memory deficits themselves. We can conclude that insight is multidimensional and domain specific but that it also has associations, which are common across domains and disorders. The sense of self and awareness that one is ill or impaired appear to be separate phenomena and may relate to lateral and medial frontal executive systems, respectively.",

Non-verbal behaviour in depression resembles ancient strategies of vertebrates to signal submission. At the cognitive level, people with depression often engage in ruminating thoughts, often involving self-derogation or worthlessness. Depression may occur in situations when one’s social status is threatened or an actual fall in rank has taken place. This is often accompanied by a reduction of serotonin availability. Genes conferring risk for depression when coupled with adverse early experiences may even protect against depression when associated with supportive parenting, suggesting genetic plasticity. Aside from ethological considerations, depression may also be linked to a dysfunction of the immune system.",

Alcohol itself is unlikely to be the responsible toxin, for improvement of the neuropathy can occur by restoration of normal diet despite continued drinking. Fits are a symptom of an abnormal cerebral cortex, so can be caused by many of the consequences of alcoholism. A small proportion of alcoholics develop bilateral progressive visual impairment, associated with characteristic central or centro-caecal scotoma and optic atrophy.

Vertigo, meaning a sensation of spinning or movement, can be an inner ear problem or a brain problem: Stop toxic substances; if there is nystagmus, refer to ENT for a full evaluation; perform the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to assess for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; and refer to physical therapy for repositioning maneuvers if positive; consider vestibular rehabilitation; consider a short course of medication such as scopolamine or meclizine; consider ordering an MRI scan of the brain, as sometimes the concussion unmasks another unrelated problem. Dizziness meaning “mental fogginess” usually turns out to be attention deficit. Dizziness meaning vague and nonspecific malaise usually turns out to be fatigue, depression, or anxiety.",

      "title": "Do antidepressants improve negative symptoms in schizophrenia?",
      "abstract": "The negative symptoms of schizophrenia comprise a range of deficits in communication, emotional responsiveness, socialisation, capacity for experiencing pleasure, and motivation. Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

The condition gradually fades away within a few hours or during a night's sleep, and what remains is lack or loss of memory for the episodic period or sometimes retrograde amnesia. Relapses were not observed in the majority of patients. The disease usually develops in people in their sixth to eighth decades of life. The cause of the disease is not yet fully understood. Accordingly, it is justified to use such terms as autochthonous or cryptogenic amnestic episodes. The disease is also discussed from a differential diagnosis point of view.",

Some of these symptoms disappear quickly, whereas others persist. This chapter focuses mostly on symptoms that cannot be easily understood from a solely biomedical perspective, the so-called functional somatic symptoms (FSS). The symptoms referred to as FSS are comprised of varying combinations of pain in different parts of the body, functional disturbances attributed to organs like cardiovascular or gastrointestinal dysfunctions or dizziness, and symptoms surrounding fatigue. Their main characteristics, pathophysiology, and etiology are briefly discussed. In addition, the authors discuss the relation between FSS and the current DSM classification of somatic symptom disorder and other related diagnostic categories.",

Some of these seizures cause great alarm to their victims, in that they seem to threaten paralysis, speechlessness, unconsciousness, or even death itself, or because they occasion profound states of instability and prostration. The appearance and sufferings of the patients during these attacks may further alarm relatives or onlookers, and even the medical man, unless he be familiar with the true nature of the seizures or fully alive to the history of the case, may be taken unawares, and feel so dubious about their purport and outcome as to be unable to give a reassuring prognosis. And yet the seizures which I have in mind are all consistent with long life and with good health at other times. Those with the more local effects may simulate or suggest organic disease of the brain ; those causing serious instability may also be wrongly attributed to cerebral vascular disease or cerebral tumour ; those which cause",

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

      "abstract": "Seizures result from imbalances between excitation and inhibition, and between neuronal synchrony and dyssynchrony. Current models implicate the cerebral cortex in the genesis of seizures, although thalamic mechanisms (particularly the thalamic reticular formation) are involved in the synchronization of cortical neurons. Often, the precipitants of a seizure in the critical care setting are pharmacological. Several mechanisms linked to critical illness can lead to seizures. Failure to remove glutamate and potassium from the extracellular space, functions performed predominantly by astrocytes, occurs in trauma, hypoxia, ischaemia, and hypoglycaemia. Loss of normal inhibition occurs during withdrawal from alcohol and other hypnosedative agents, or in the presence of GABA. Conditions such as cerebral trauma, haemorrhages, abscesses, and neoplasms all produce physical distortions of the adjacent neurons, astrocytes, and the extracellular space. Deposition of iron in the cortex from the breakdown of haemoglobin appears particularly epileptogenic. Although acute metabolic disturbances can commonly produce seizures in critically-ill patients, an underlying and potentially treatable structural lesion must always be considered and excluded.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Impairment of neurocognitive functions, such as attention, memory or executive functions, as well as of social cognition, particularly of affect recognition and theory of mind, are frequently observed in people with Schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. These dysfunctions are associated with poor real-life functioning. Social cognition deficits mediate in part the impact of neurocognitive dysfunction on functional outcome. Aims To review literature findings on prevalence, severity and association with functional outcome of neurocognitive and social cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Methods We searched PubMed for English/Italian or French full-text publications with the keywords. schizophr*/psychosis/psychot*/AND neurocognitive/cognitive/neuropsychological/memory/attention/”executive function”/learning/”social cognition”/”theory of mind”/”affect recognition”/”acial emotion recognition”/”emotional intelligence”/”emot* recognition”. Furthermore, we manually searched the reference lists of relevant papers, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Results In people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, neurocognitive and social cognition deficits were observed in all phases of the disorders, even after symptom remission. Some of these deficits were observed in subjects at high-risk to develop schizophrenia before psychotic onset. In all these subjects, cognitive deficits are associated with worse psychosocial functioning and poor quality of life. Pharmacological treatments do not alleviate cognitive deficits, which can also limit the benefit of other psychological or psychosocial interventions. Conclusions Neurocognitive and social cognition deficits need to be targeted by specific interventions to improve real-life functioning and quality of life of people with schizophrenia or psychotic disorders.

      "title": "Cases of Senile Insanity, with Remarks",
      "abstract": "Admitting the difficulties that one has in the classification of insanity, it seems to me, at all events, reasonable that we should recognise classes associated with definite physical changes. Symptoms may be ever changing and deceptive. A patient may to all appearances be weak-minded, but on recovery it may be found that such patient's apparent abstraction and mental weakness were merely the result of an overbearing and overpowering sense of misery, so that, in fact he was suffering distinctly from melancholia, and the mental faculties were in abeyance through the assertion of other painful sensations. A severe grief or an intense occupation of any kind may make one forgetful of his surroundings, regardless of the state of the weather, the time of day, the condition of one's general health, and so on; and so it is that in many cases of profound melancholy there is an apparent arrest of function. This by the way. We have to consider the fact that at certain periods of life there are certain special tendencies to an intellectual breakdown. Any serious affection of the brain in early childhood so affects the as yet undeveloped structure that it totters readily to its fall, and, once having suffered a severe shock, it is with difficulty restored. In the period of adolescence other functions of the body are developed, and with them many stirring sensations are aroused, which have a great tendency to upset the highly nervous and unstable neurotic patient. As life progresses some people exhibit marked tendencies to die out through their nervous systems. Certain persons develope phthisis late in life; others develop cancer, gout, chronic rheumatism, or other constitutional vices. But the thing that interests me most in this consideration is that there are definite forms of disease seen in patients dying out from exhaustion or wearing out of their nervous tissues. As has so often been said, age is purely relative. A man may be a boy at 70 or an old man at 35. Age, from the physician's side, is a relative advance towards decay and destruction of the most important of the vital tissues and organs. A man may have all his organs slowly degenerating before he has reached middle life, the degeneration being due to some constitutional disease, or to some such condition as atheroma of the vessels. In an asylum one constantly comes across patients who have inherited insanity from their parents, and who have inherited a special form of insanity, and even others who have not inherited any special form, but have inherited the tendency which produced the insanity; thus whereas one person has atheroma of the vessels and dies of apoplexy, another has atheroma of his vessels and dies of aneurism, and another patient has atheroma of his vessels and angina pectoris, so that the offspring of these patients may have not only the atheroma of the artery, but either the apoplexy, the aneurism, or the angina pectoris, according to whether the parents had the one or the other. I have seen many cases in which a parent has suffered from mental disease only when he has become 60 or 70, and the children have gone on very well until they reached a similar age, and then have broken down under similar circumstances in a very similar way. It would not be right always to say that this has no relationship to mental effects and to predispositions. One knows that suicide, for instance, is not only associated with a family disposition to nervous disease, but is in many cases also associated with a dominant idea which has from early days been before the patient's mind—that suicide has been, as it were, the evil genius of the family; and so the fact that a parent has died of nervous breakdown has been reported to a patient, or has been remembered by him, and when he comes to a like age he necessarily thinks more about the fate of his parent, and this alone, in some temperaments, might be a cause of producing insanity. In some families it is very noteworthy that a certain age is looked upon as being critical, and if that age be satisfactorily passed, the individual may live to a considerable age beyond, but immediately before this crucial period many members have begun with ailments and have certainly worried themselves into their graves. But what I would distinctly assert is that in certain families the tendency is to die of some affection of the nervous system in preference to dying by any other system; and it is interesting to note that in some of these cases the tendency is not always transmitted in exactly the same way, but that the offspring of such parents, if they have not been placed in otherwise favourable circumstances, may break down earlier in life; and although I am not in a position to assert positively that such is the case, many instances have inclined me to the belief that the offspring of those parents who have broken down, say at the climacteric or from advanced age, are more liable than other insane patients to break down at special periods, such as at adolescence and the climacteric. When one comes to consider the changes that we mean by old age, I should say that the mark I have used as the test as to atheromatous condition of the arteries is seen by the tortuous temporal arteries, and the rigid and rather high-tension in the radial pulse. Other symptoms, such as capillary congestion about the cheeks, white hair, and a tendency to leanness, have, of course, been considered, as well as the condition of the eye called arcus senilis . All the patients to whom I shall refer have the above characteristics, as well as years over 60. They suffer either from progressive dementia, with or without paralysis, or from melancholia of one form or another. As we shall see presently, they suffered from hypochondriacal symptoms, or in some cases exhibited maniacal excitement with exaltation, and I shall have to refer specially to at least one case in which these symptoms were so markedly like those of general paralysis of the insane that I was constantly asking myself in what the difference consisted between our typical cases of general paralysis of the insane and cases such as the one under consideration. We were obliged to confess that if the patient had been brought before us, and that blindfold we had been told that his age was 35, we should not have hesitated for a moment in saying that his was a typical case of the disease. General paralysis does occur in old men sometimes as well as in young men, but it is not nearly so common, and when we meet with these cases wo are obliged to consider them as a special sub-variety of the disease, or else must look upon them merely as cases of degradation of nerve tissue, having somewhat similar symptoms, to the symptoms seen in general paralysis of the insane. I am rather fond of regarding these cases as not truly those of general paralysis, but as examples of progressive nerve degeneration, and I prefer to look upon symptoms of general paralysis of the insane as symptoms that are produced solely by a steady and progressive degeneration of the highest nerve centres; and under these circumstances I would expect that any disease which produced steady, progressive degeneration of these highest centres would also produce similar symptoms, just as in the lung, whether it be a tubercle, a mass of smoke, or a piece of steel or stone that sets up irritation, inflammation, degeneration, and a cavity, the course and symptoms of the disease are the same.",

      "abstract": "Syndrome of dementia, which appears as a result of deterioration of brain structure that is caused by different factors, together with syndrome of psychomotor restlessness, represents one of the most common psychiatric conditions at patients of the geriatric population (older than 75 years). Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

For the differential diagnosis, history and other symptoms are important such as hemiplegia, signs of brain stem dysfunction, meningism or headache. Metabolic, endocrinologic, toxicologic or electrolytic causes of coma usually can be diagnosed by laboratory examinations. Anamnestic informations, body inspection, clinical neurological examination as well as laboratory and imaging findings have to be added and categorized by a multilevel composition to establish a conclusive diagnosis. Simultaneously therapeutic measures for suspected primary cerebral diseases must be initiated, for example a rapid antibiotic treatment in case of a possible bacterial meningitis. A fast and structured diagnostic approach is crucial for ensuring a good prognosis and helps to miss relevant diagnostic steps. Potential diagnostic and therapeutic pitfalls must be kept in mind.",

      "abstract": "Apathy is a reduction in goal-directed activity in the cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social domains of a patient’s life and occurs in one out of three patients after stroke. Despite this, apathy is clinically under-recognized and poorly understood. This overview provides a contemporary introduction to apathy in stroke for researchers and practitioners, covering topics including diagnosis, neurobiological mechanisms, associated consequences, and potential treatments for apathy. Apathy is often misdiagnosed as other post-stroke conditions such as depression. Accurate differential diagnosis of apathy, which manifests as reductions in initiative, and depression, which manifests as negative emotionality, is important as it informs prognosis. Research on the neurobiology of apathy suggests that there are few consistent associations between stroke lesion location and the development of apathy. These may be resolved by adopting a network neuroscience approach, which models apathy as a pathology arising from structural or functional damage to brain networks underlying motivated behavior. Importantly, networks can be affected by physiological changes related to stroke, including the acute infarct but also diaschisis and neurodegeneration. Aside from neurobiological changes, apathy is also associated with other negative outcome measures such as functional disability, cognitive impairment, and emotional distress, suggesting that apathy is indicative of a worse prognosis following stroke. Unfortunately, high-quality trials aimed at treating apathy are scarce. Antidepressants may have limited effects on apathy. Acetylcholine and dopamine pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, and transcranial magnetic stimulation may be more promising avenues for treatment.",

      "abstract": "Dementia represents decline in cognitive functioning which interferes with working ability and social skills. Dementia can be divided in two categories, reversible and irreversible dementia, depending on what was the cause of illness. Since symptoms of dementia are overlapping with symptoms of depression and delirium (both treatable conditions), one should be careful when diagnosing dementia. Most common and most important type of irreversible dementia is Alzheimer’s dementia. Aggregation of senile plaques and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins are still in focus when talking about the pathophysiology of the disease. The increase of oxidative stress and therefore changes in functioning of neurons both lead to neurological decline. Progressive decline in cognitive functioning, inability to perform everyday activities, behavioral changes and dependence on help of family members or medical personnel are some of the symptoms of dementia. Significant cognitive deprivation in the majority of diseased can lead to behavioral impairment. People with dementia are prone to delusions and hallucinations, which makes their treatment quite challenging. Since there is no cure for dementia, only symptomatolitic remedies are being used. These drugs reduce symptoms of dementia, but also delay admission to nursing homes. Currently used drugs are NMDA receptor antagonist memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors- rivastigmin, galantamin and donepezil. Memantine decreases impact of glutamate on oxidative stress of neurons and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors restore loss of cholinergic pathways by inhibiting breakdown of acetylcholine in synaptic cleft. Behavioral and psychotic symptoms are treated with antipsychotics and benzodiazepines.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

The etiology of FMS remains unknown, being one of the most accepted hypothesis the presence of central sensitization to pain and impairments in endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms. The history of the development of FMS concept reveals how other symptoms -apart from pain- has become also relevant in FMS diagnosis and treatment.&#x0D; The central symptom of FMS is pain. FMS patients generally report high levels of clinical pain, which are related to greater impairments in health related quality of life, cognitive abilities and disease course. Fatigue and sleeping difficulties are also common symptoms of FMS. Fatigue have shown positive associations with pain, stiffness, sleep problems, increased body mass index, FMS severity, tenderness, disability, cognitive complaints, anxiety and depression. The majority of FMS patients report poor sleep quality, take longer to fall asleep, generally wake up during the night, sleep fewer hours, and usually wake up unrefreshed. Emotional disturbances (i.e., depression, anxiety) are also frequent in FMS. In fact, depression and anxiety disorders have showed a negative impact on the clinical course and work capacity of FMS patients. Cognitive impairments are also a relevant symptom in FMS. The most common complaints among FMS patients are executive function deficits, attention problems, forgetfulness, concentration difficulties, and mental slowness. Regarding the most frequent treatments for FMS, these can be classified as non-psychological and psychological. The former includes analgesic drugs, adjuvant drugs (i.e., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, etc.), nerve blocks, electrostimulation at different levels, infiltrations, etc. The psychological therapies with the most evidence are cognitive-behavioral, acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness.&#x0D; FMS is associated with a severe reduction of health related quality of life and psychosocial impairments. It is necessary to take all FMS symptoms and its relations into account in order to provide a more tailored and effective treatment, as well as, to improve the health related quality of life of FMS patients.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION\nLa Esclerosis Multiple (EM) es una enfermedad de naturaleza desmielinizante y curso cronico, cuya base anatomopatologica se caracteriza por un proceso de destruccion de las vainas de mielina que recubren los axones neuronales (manifestandose en forma de lesiones distribuidas extensamente en el parenquima cerebral y la medula espinal), lo que propiciaria una alteracion en los mecanismos sinapticos y la emergencia de los sintomas caracteristicos de la misma. Se trata de una neuropatologia que se diagnostica habitualmente al final de la segunda decada de la vida o inicio de la tercera, con una prevalencia superior entre las mujeres (2:1). Supone, ademas, una de las principales causas de discapacidad en este periodo etario. \nA nivel sintomatologico se aprecia una clinica diversa en la que predomina el compromiso sensomotriz, acompanado con cierta frecuencia de perdidas en otras areas de relevancia clinica y humana (vision, funcion vesical/intestinal, estabilidad postural, fatiga o dolor; entre otros). La evolucion es generalmente en forma de brotes periodicos (85%), seguidos de un periodo de remision/estabilidad tras el cual pueden prevalecer sintomas residuales (cuyo efecto acumulativo genera discapacidad con el devenir del tiempo). Ocasionalmente este proceso se presenta de modo continuo, tanto desde el inicio de la enfermedad (EM primaria progresiva) como tras algunos anos de convivencia con el subtipo bifasico (EM secundaria progresiva), momento en el que la EM constituye un reto terapeutico todavia mayor. \nLa literatura sobre esta patologia evidencia la presencia de resonancias en el area de la salud mental de estos pacientes (presencia de sintomas depresivos, deterioro de la calidad de vida, compromiso de la funcion cognitiva, etc.), que requieren la puesta en marcha de recursos diagnosticos y terapeuticos especificos dirigidos a su deteccion y abordaje clinico.\n OBJETIVO\nLa presente tesis doctoral tiene como proposito principal evaluar a un grupo de pacientes con diagnostico de EM en una serie de variables sociodemograficas, clinicas, psicologicas y neuropsicologicas; con el fin de explorar las relaciones que se establecen entre todas ellas y detectar las necesidades asistenciales de este colectivo en el ambito de la salud mental.\n METODO\nSe opto por un diseno descriptivo y transversal, de corte correlacional. Se incluyo un grupo control (personas sin evidencia de la enfermedad), de tamano equivalente al clinico (n=55 en ambos casos). Tras una profunda revision de la literatura, se procedio a la construccion de una bateria de evaluacion dirigida a la exploracion de las siguientes variables: estres (Escala de Sucesos Vitales Estresantes -SVEAD), afrontamiento (Cuestionario de Estilos de Afrontamiento -COPE), apoyo social (Cuestionario Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey -MOS-SSS), personalidad (Cuestionario de Personalidad de Eysenck Revisado -EPQ-R), sintomas psicologicos (Cuestionario Revisado de Sintomas Psicologicos -SCL-90-R), calidad de vida (Cuestionario Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 -MSQOL-54), dolor (West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory -WHYMPI) y funcion cognitiva (Bateria Neuropsicologica Breve -BNB y Trail Making Test -TMT). Para la evaluacion de las variables sociodemograficas se diseno una entrevista ad hoc.\nEl analisis de los datos contemplo estrategias de comparacion de medias, analisis multivariados (discriminante), analisis correlacionales y analisis de mediacion; ademas del calculo de los correspondientes tamanos del efecto. Adicionalmente, se exploro la consistencia interna de todos los factores sometidos a estudio.\n RESULTADOS\nDe las diferencias obtenidas entre los pacientes y la poblacion general (de las que se infieren las necesidades asistenciales) se concluye: un malestar emocional mas intenso, una erosion pronunciada de la calidad de vida, un apoyo social deficitario, un perfil de personalidad que implica vulnerabilidad para la psicopatologia, un estres acentuado y un uso mas frecuente del afrontamiento emocional. Paralelamente, el analisis discriminante extrae las dimensiones que permiten una mejor diferenciacion entre los grupos, asi como su correspondiente capacidad de clasificacion.\nSe confirma, asimismo, el papel modulador de determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas (discapacidad, estres percibido, experiencia de un brote reciente y problemas para dormir) sobre un amplio abanico de dimensiones psicologicas y neuropsicologicas, evidenciandose la configuracion de patrones especificos de expresion en casa caso. Tambien se corrobora el papel mediador del apoyo social en la relacion que se establece entre la discapacidad y el malestar emocional, asi como la capacidad de mediacion del afrontamiento orientado a la emocion y el neuroticismo en la asociacion entre el estres y las variables de resultado (sintomas psicologicos y calidad de vida). Por ultimo, se detallan las interacciones entre las variables contempladas en el estudio, de modo que puedan discernirse las relaciones de covariacion que se establecen entre todas ellas en aras de una comprension mas profunda de la experiencia interna del paciente.\n CONCLUSION\nLa EM es una enfermedad compleja, que presenta un evidente impacto sobre la salud mental de la persona que la sufre. La presente tesis doctoral extrae algunas de las principales necesidades asistenciales (incluyendo el modo en que determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas durante el proceso de enfermedad pueden modular la experiencia subjetiva del paciente) y explora las interacciones entre variables de relevancia clinica (incluyendose las relaciones con el deterioro cognitivo), de modo que pueda incrementarse el conocimiento disponible sobre la enfermedad desde la perspectiva de la salud mental. Los analisis de mediacion determinan que tanto el apoyo social como el estilo de afrontamiento emocional (dos dimensiones susceptibles de abordaje terapeutico) tienen un importante papel explicativo en la relacion que se objetiva entre la discapacidad y el estres con la sintomatologia psicologica y la calidad de vida. \nLos resultados obtenidos permiten incrementar el conocimiento actual sobre los aspectos psicologicos y neuropsicologicos de la EM, y ofrecer herramientas para el diseno de un plan de tratamiento orientado a este colectivo.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging in Epileptic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic disorders, and affects about 50 million people around the world. It is a heterogeneous condition characterized by recurrent spontaneous epileptic seizures. There are no age, sex or race discriminations, although incidence of the first epileptic seizure has a bimodal distribution, with peaks in childhood and after 60 years of age (Engel & Pedley, 2008). According to their localization, epilepsies and epileptic seizures should be classified as focal (or partial) and generalized. Partial seizures begin in a restricted portion of cerebral cortex. Partial seizures are associated with a restricted area of the of the cerebral cortex and are clasified as either simple or complex, depending on the level of conscious awareness. Simple partial seizures are characterized by brief specific neurologic dysfunction, contingent upon the localization of the epileptogenic focus. By definition, they do not compromise consciousness during the event, and might manifest as motor signs (with a focus involving the primary motor area), sensitive symptoms (focus in the primary somatosensory area), autonomic or psychic signs (mesiobasal areas). Complex partial seizures affect the patient’s consciousness from the onset of the event. Both simple and complex partial seizures can propagate to the whole brain and become secondarily generalized seizures. Examples of primary generalized seizures are absence seizures, tonic-clonic generalized seizures, and myoclonic seizures. All those three seizure types are generated by epileptic discharges involving both cerebral hemispheres from their onset. By extension, focal epilepsies are characterized by recurrent spontaneous partial seizures, and generalized epilepsies have generalized seizures as their main seizure type. Epilepsies can be idiopathic (without an identifiable structural cause), symptomatic (due to a structural lesion), or cryptogenic (with a presumed lesion, not detectable by current available neuroimaging methods). Broadly, idiopathic epilepsies (partial or generalized) begin in the childhood years, have a good prognosis, and go into remission during adolescence. The symptomatic generalized epilepsies encompass a group of epileptic syndromes with very poor prognosis, characterized by extremely refractory seizures and accompanied by neurodevelopmental delay. The symptomatic partial epilepsies depict a large spectrum of epileptic disorders caused by several types of brain lesions. A significant percentage of patients who have seizures not responsive to antiepileptic drugs is affected by this type of epilepsy. Surgical treatment becomes a good therapeutic option for these patients, and the identification of the structural cortical lesion causing their epilepsies is primordial for a good postsurgical prognosis (Panaiyotopoulos, 2010).",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of associative agnosia must be envisaged when the patients fail to recognise a meaningful visual stimulus, whose perceptual structure has been adequately encoded. The inability to retrieve mental images characterises a clinical pattern that bears some relation to visual agnosia and is relevant to the understanding of the processes underlying visual perception. An amnestic or associative form of prosopagnosia can be envisaged when the patient passes all perceptual tests and fails the recognition of familiar faces, though showing intact semantic knowledge of the persons to whom they refer. An interesting phenomenon, brought out in prosopagnosia, as well as in other cognitive domains, is unconscious recognition. In adults, the most common aetiology of prosopagnosia is stroke in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery. Tactile agnosia is the inability to recognise an object through palpation, in spite of preserved or minimally impaired somatosensory functions.",

Complicated grief represent a pathological outcome involving social, physical, emotional, cognitive, spiritual morbidity. The common psychiatric disorders associated complicated grief or abnormal grief responses include clinical depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol abuse or other substance abuse, and dependence, psychotic disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Grief tasks involve a series of stage or phases following an important loss that gradually permit adjustment and recovery. Three phases of grief involve phase 1 (walking the edges), phase 2 (entering the depths), and phase 3 (reconnecting the world). For intervention to be effective they need to be individually tailored to abnormal grief reaction or unresolved grief reaction. Clear understandings of complicated grief, abnormal responses, factors increasing risk after bereavement will often enable us to prevent psychiatric disorders in bereaved patients.】",

      "title": "Change In Mental Status",
      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

      "title": "Characterizing the phenomenology of anxiety in older adults with subjective cognitive decline",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), defined as perception of memory or other cognitive decline with normal test performance, is conceptualized as a preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease. Formulations of SCD typically include presence of worry or concern regarding the perceived cognitive decline. Accordingly, SCD is associated with anxiety, but its underlying etiology remains unclear. In the current study, we compared mood, anxiety, and personality amongst SCD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults to characterize anxiety in SCD. Methods 146 older adults received psychiatric/medical assessments, self‐report measures of subjective memory, and neuropsychological (NP) tests to establish diagnosis. MCI [n=33,17F, age 72.3(SD6.7)] had subjective memory/other cognitive complaints, impaired NP performance, and functional independence. SCD [n=71,49F, age 71.1(SD6.3)] endorsed subjective memory decline with worry and normal NP performance. CU [n=42, 27F, age 70.6(SD6.8)] had normal NP performance and absence of subjective memory decline with worry. Participants were free of lifetime history of psychiatric illness and neurological conditions. They completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), NEO Five‐Factor Inventory (NEO‐FFI) which includes neuroticism, Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Multivariate ANOVA was used to examine group differences, followed by post hoc comparisons with Sidak correction. Results Groups differed in STAI‐trait, NEO‐FFI neuroticism, HAI, and GDS [F(2,143)=5.26, P=.006; F(2,143)=3.26, P=.041; F(2,143)=4.61, P=.011; F(2,143)=7.66, P=.046, respectively]. Relative to CU, STAI‐trait and HAI scores were elevated in SCD and MCI (P’s&lt;.05). NEO‐FFI neuroticism was higher in SCD compared to CU (P=.024). No differences between SCD and MCI were detected on any measure. Differences in GDS scores did not survive Sidak correction. Conclusions Anxiety symptoms in SCD without lifetime history of psychiatric illness are best conceptualized as neuroticism, a personality trait that increases proneness to negative affect. Based on non‐elevated levels of state anxiety and depression, anxiety in SCD does not appear to represent an emotional reaction to cognitive decline nor epiphenomena of subclinical depression. Health anxiety, or belief that one has a serious illness, was comparable in SCD and MCI. Future research is needed to clarify the role of neuroticism and its links with subjective and objective memory in SCD.",

      "abstract": "In cases of traumatic brain injuries in children it may be difficult to differentiate between physical abuse and accidental occurrence. This review will shed light on discriminating epidemiological as well as biomechanical data, morphological findings, and clinical features. As a basic principle, simple injuries are caused by simple mechanisms like falls whereas life-threatening injuries should be attributed to abuse until proven otherwise. Implausibilities between reported events and mechanisms by caregivers as well as more than one explanation of injury indicate suspicion of child abuse. From reviewing the literature, it can be stated that falls from less than 1.5 m lead only in few cases to severe brain injuries. Children who experienced a fall at home seldom exhibit fractures of the skull but just minor intracranial injuries without neurological deficits. Regarding biomechanical aspects, multiple or complex skull fractures, depression fractures, additional fractures of the body, and intracranial hemorrhages as a consequence of an impact are the most important findings in child abuse. Moreover, additional specific morphological criteria give evidence of clinical and/or post-mortem diagnosis of the shaken baby syndrome. These include subdural hemorrhage and laceration of the brain and retinal bleeding, epidural hemorrhage of the cervical cord, gripping marks (bruises) on chest and/or shoulders, and tearing injuries of the throat and neck muscles. Post-mortem signs of recurrent shaken baby syndrome are indicated by iron-positive cells or microglial cells in neuronal or retinal tissue. A clinical diagnosis will be dependent on the one hand on the exclusion of coagulation diseases, on the other hand on the demonstration of a subdural hemorrhage by means of neuroimaging techniques, i.e., CT and MRI, as well as retinal hemorrhage. The shaken baby syndrome will usually be observed within the first year of life. The doctor has to manifest his diagnosis to the caregivers and - before informing the caregivers - he must be sure of his diagnosis.",

Their general occurrence is reflected in phrases like “it makes me sick” and “to sweat with fear”. In some groups of people these autonomic disturbances are not confined to stressful situations but become more general and frequent and so more disabling. For instance, in patients with affective illnesses, symptoms of autonomic origin are common and are relieved by successful treatment of the underlying illness. Again, there is a group of patients who complain of these symptoms but who show little affective disorder. In these patients the autonomic symptoms are provoked by specific situations which are not particularly stressful to normal people, e.g. nausea occurs when eating in company or diarrhoea when travelling; outside these specific situations symptoms do not occur. Although these patients may complain of some anxiety, the physical symptom is the major complaint and the anxiety is often attributed to this.",

      "abstract": "The commonality of cognitive impairment and depression is discussed. Cognitive symptoms are the main symptoms of depressive disorder and, most often, it is cognitive impairment that reduces the performance and quality of life of depressed patients. The most common cognitive disorders in depressed patients are: attention deficit (both visual and auditory), decrease in the level of short-term and operative memory, difficulties in processing information of any modality, a decrease in the speed of information processing, as well as difficulties in building an activity program and monitoring her execution. A cognitive symptom that requires further discussion is the so-called cognitive distortion – a shift in focus from positive to negative stimuli, as well as incorrect reactions to negative feedback and decision making. A depressive episode develops against the background of dysmetabolic and dysfunctional cerebral changes in the amygdala, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, orbitofrontal and mediobasal frontal cortex. Cognitive impairment in patients who have had depression persists after recovery from depression; according to the figurative expression adopted in the scientific community of specialists studying cognitive impairment in depression, each depressive episode forms permanent “cognitive scars”. Presumably, cognitive dysfunction may be one of the risk factors for the development of a depressive disorder; depression, in turn, is a risk factor for the development of dementia, including in Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease: studies have shown that the transformation of severe cognitive impairment associated with depression into dementia in elderly patients can reach 70% in five years. The undoubted commonality of depression and cognitive dysfunction is emphasized by the frequency of depression in patients with cognitive impairment.",

      "title": "Feeling emotional: the amygdala links emotional perception and experience",
      "abstract": "The term ‘emotion’ most commonly denotes a specific phenomenal state, such as the solemn weightiness associated with sadness or the lightness of being associated with joy. Human affective neuroscience has begun to pin down the elusive neuroanatomy of these most experientially prominent of mental experiences. One of the brain structures consistently associated with emotional functioning is the amygdaloid complex (Phan et al., 2002). Numerous neuroimaging studies have shown the amygdala varies with emotional experience in both healthy and mood disordered populations, pointing to its central role in emotional phenomenology. One difficulty with this apparent association is that emotion like cognition is not a single entity but is a multi-component process. Emotions reflect a constellation of diverse but correlated central neurocognitive and peripheral physiologic events. For example, witnessing a gruesome automobile accident is highly negatively valent, may involve specific appraisals related to fear or sadness, results in central and peripheral autonomic arousal, is attention grabbing thereby demanding to be the central focus of awareness, and in the following months and years may be associated with vivid reminiscences. In the safer confines of the lab or the bore of an MRI scanner, the amygdala has been associated to some extent with all of these putative functions. As such, amygdala activity may represent the generation of emotional experience itself, and/or it may reflect sundry aspects of emotional information processing correlated with emotional experience. In this issue, Feldman Barrett et al. demonstrate amygdala responses represent a critical nexus between the propensity for emotional experience and emotional interactions with perceptual encoding. The amygdala's role in feeling emotions may be tied to enhanced sensitivity toward emotional perception.\r\n\r\nFeldman Barrett et al. examined amygdala activation and its relation to emotional experience through the use of experience sampling. For 1 month three times daily, participants were probed via handheld PDA to indicate their present emotional state. One year following, participants were presented with backwardly masked fearful facial expressions during fMRI to index sensitivity of perceptual encoding of emotional events. Individual differences in propensity for negative affect, as indexed by experience sampling, were correlated with magnitude of amygdala response to presented fear faces. Moreover, in participants reporting increased anxiety during scanning, amygdala responses were associated with enhanced perceptual encoding of faces as indicated by increased fusiform activity. These results suggest that the amygdala may contribute to emotional experience by setting the appropriate preconditions for its expression: enhancing attention and associated perceptual encoding of emotional events, and thereby increasing their subjective salience.\r\n\r\nConsidering the mounting neuroimaging evidence consistent with an important role of the amygdala in generating affective experience there is surprisingly little direct evidence of disordered emotional experience following amygdala damage (Anderson and Phelps 2000; Anderson and Phelps 2002; Tranel et al., 2006), compared with evidence of the amygdala's central role in the emotional enhancement of mnemonic (Cahill et al., 1995) and perceptual processes (Anderson and Phelps 2001; Vuilleumier et al., 2004; Adolphs et al., 2005). For instance, patients with amygdala lesions provide retrospective reports of affective states (daily reflections) and traits (yearly reflections) of similar magnitude, frequency and underlying covariance structure to healthy controls (Anderson and Phelps, 2002). When asked to relive emotions, examinations of facial efference reveal that patients with bilateral amygdala damage display remarkably intact emotional expressions, including fear, despite pronounced impairments in the perception of these same signals (Anderson and Phelps, 2000). The results of such lesion studies, however, regard introspective emotional experiences that are associated with complex abstract factors and not directly tied to momentary environmental events. Many emotional experiences involve ruminations upon the past or future, thereby involving representations of threats and rewards in the absence of in the moment environmental stimulation. Such forms of emotional replay and forecasting may depend upon evolutionary more recent prefrontal neocortical representations rather than the amygdala alone. By contrast, the results of Feldman-Barrett et al. suggest that the amygdala's role is more related to momentary experiential states and enhanced attention and sensitivity toward encoding events surrounding these states.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala is neuroanatomically positioned to make a rapid and coarse appraisal of the state of the world, and via robust feedback projections, alter the perceptual process by enhancing the encoding of events of potential self importance. Neuroimaging studies have shown that emotionally arousing scenes vigorously engage early primary and secondary visual cortex (Bradley et al., 2003). Emotions thus bias attention to focus on events associated with subjective and physiologic arousal, shaping the ultimate contents of awareness (Anderson, 2005). Such arousal based modulatory effects depend on the integrity of the amygdala, with amygdala lesions eliminating the subjective biasing of perception toward the significant relative to the mundane, rendering the attentional landscape flat (Anderson and Phelps, 2001). Directly corroborating the results of Feldman-Barrett, enhanced extrastriate cortical responses to facial expressions of fear are correlated with magnitude of amygdala response (Morris et al., 1998), and these enhanced extrastriate responses are abolished following amygdala damage (Vuilleumier et al., 2004). The amygdala's role in evaluating the emotional value of fearful faces similarly depends on the ability to correctly attend to and encode their important features (Adolphs et al., 2005). If all the world's a stage, then the amygdala may be the emotional spotlight, shedding light on the most dramatic players of our life story.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala may thus represent embodied attention—the crucial link between central (mental) and peripheral (bodily) resources. Attention and awareness should be coupled with information of sufficient importance to result in autonomic activation and associated mobilization of peripheral metabolic resources, such as through altered respiration and heart rate. This redirecting of bodily physiologic resources may serve as the common primitive foundations of both attention and emotional experience. This common origin supports why emotional states are strongly correlated with how we think about and perceive the environment (Barrett and Niedenthal, 2004; Anderson, 2005; Rowe et al, 2007). More than a simple correlation, Feldman-Barrett et al.'s results suggest that emotional experience and individual differences therein may critically depend upon how we attend to the world (Barrett and Niedenthal, 2004; Anderson, 2005). Rather than being an ancillary consequence of, altered attention to emotional events may be part and parcel of emotional experience itself.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In these patients, cognitive, mood, and emotional disturbances are commonly observed, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, and anger/aggression. The debilitating effect of TBI extends years after the initial injury and impairs the recovery process and patients' quality of life. Compared to other major neurological diseases such as stroke or degenerative diseases, TBI occurs relatively young. Therefore, patients have to endure the sequelae for a more extended period. Therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment of the cognitive–emotional symptoms are essential. Studies have been made to seek the pathogenesis of the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been underrecognized and understudied. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare. It has been suggested that the congitive and emotional sequelae are related to the \"remote\" effect of the initial brain injury rather than the initial pathology itself. This review will describe some of the most common or relevant poststroke mood and emotional disturbances. The phenomenology, factors or predictors, and relevant lesion locations will be described, and pharmacological treatment of these emotional disturbances will be discussed based on presumable pathophysiological mechanisms.",

Estos problemas incluyen, por ejemplo, las enfermedades mentales, como la depresión, o las alteraciones cardiovasculares, como la hipertensión arterial.

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

La gravedad del deterioro y la variedad de sintomas asociados a los trastornos del neurodesarrollo o a sindromes epilepticos especificos reflejan disfunciones focales o globales, estructurales o funcionales de las redes neuronales. La compleja relacion entre los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y la epilepsia es de menor importancia que los factores comunes que incluyen la genetica, la cognicion, la funcion motora y del lenguaje. Las encefalopatias epilepticas estan asociadas a una regresion o una ralentizacion del funcionamiento cognitivo, del lenguaje o de la conducta, y la hipotesis de trabajo aceptada es que esta es una consecuencia directa de las crisis o de la actividad epileptiforme interictal, y no de la enfermedad asociada. Los datos que apoyan la idea de que las crisis recurrentes o la actividad electrica anomala pueden provocar alteraciones especificas cognitivas, del lenguaje o de la conducta, incluso en las encefalopatias epilepticas aceptadas, todavia son objeto de debate.

      "abstract": "For about 40% of Americans, Insomnia is a major health issue that often leads to fatigue, reduced immunity, and dangerous driving. A good night sleep is essential for functioning and performance. It also influences mood, cognition, concentration, fatigue, and healing. Insomnia may be related to medical and psychiatric disorders, shift work, stimulants, travel, anxiety, pain, and other problems (e.g., poor sleep environment). People with insomnia (e.g., difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings and daytime drowsiness) tend to rely on alcohol, drugs, and other remedies. Insomnia may reflect sleep apnea or other medical or mental health disorders that require evaluation as well as poor sleep hygiene. Insomnia can be brief, episodic or chronic. Unfortunately, many people assume that insomnia is normal and do not report it to the nurse or seek treatment. Sleep deprivation impairs the person's physical, mental, and cardiac functioning. Often insomnia is treated with medications which may have side effectives or be habit forming. Individuals with insomnia need evaluation of the precipitants of insomnia, education about sleep hygiene, and information about non-pharmacological treatments. In clinic and hospital settings, nurses are in a pivotal position to identify sleep problems, educate patients, and refer them for follow up.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

Subcortical dementia occurs in degenerative extrapyramidal disorders and has also been identified in inflammatory, infectious, and vascular conditions. Histologic, metabolic, and neurochemical investigations implicate dysfunction primarily of subcortical neurotransmitter systems and subcortical structures or subcortical-frontal connections in the genesis of the syndrome. Subcortical dementia contrasts neuropsychologically and anatomically with disorders such as dementia of the Alzheimer type that affect primarily the cerebral cortex. The clinical characteristics of subcortical dementia reflect the interruption of fundamental functions (motivation, mood, timing, arousal) mediated by phylogenetically and ontogenetically early maturing structures.",

Poor metacognition prevents correct appraisal of a range of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms and facilitates anosognosia, which has important clinical implications for individuals (e.g., diminished treatment adherence, increased engagement in high-risk situations) and caregivers (e.g., higher burden). However, the neural correlates of metacognitive disturbance are still debated in the literature, partly because of the subjective nature of traditional awareness measures.",

This chapter focuses on memory and depression and the effects of other mood states such as anxiety, and of positive emotions, such as happiness. In the memory and depression literature two clear research themes can be identified. The first is concerned with the effects of depressed mood on general memory performance. The second focuses on the effects of depressed mood on memory for emotional material which is either positive or negative in its hedonic tone. There are clear general memory deficits associated with depression. The association is stronger for self-reports of memory difficulties but remains substantial even on objective memory tests with stronger effects being found in younger depressed subjects and in inpatients relative to outpatients.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

      "abstract": "Basic and Clinical Endocrinology Up-to-Date 136 Single benign sporadic insulinomas 2.1 Diagnosis of hypoglycaemia related to endogenous hyperinsulinism 2.1.1 Clinical symptoms of insulinomasThe clinical symptoms of insulinomas are heterogeneous and may differ among the patients.There is no specific clinical symptom.Hypoglycaemia results in autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms.Autonomic symptoms comprise adrenergic symptoms, such as palpitations and tremor, and cholinergic symptoms, with sweating, hunger, sometimes paresthesias.Neuroglycopenic symptoms comprise severe weakness, and many psychiatric and neurological manifestations, the most commonly reported being behavioural changes, confusion, agitation or slow reaction patterns, blurred vision, and finally seizures, transient loss of consciousness or hypoglycaemic coma.Hypoglycaemic coma is typically sudden, with agitation, sometimes pyramidal signs, and hypothermia; it may be profound and prolonged and therefore may be a cause of neurologic and cognitive sequelae and may occasionally lead to brain death.The combination of autonomic and moderate neuroglycopenic symptoms strongly suggests the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia.However, in insulinoma patients, autonomic symptoms may often be lacking.Neuroglycopenic symptoms are more specific of hypoglycemia related to insulinoma, but may be mild, or more often misleading.Therefore measurement of plasma glucose concentrations should be recommended in all patients with such symptoms, either in a patient without any known neurological or psychiatric disorder, or in a patient in whom such disorder had been previously controlled.Hypoglycaemic spells typically occur suddenly after a period of fast, several hours after the last meal, or after physical exercise.Some of them have been reported to occur within the hours following a meal or without any relationship with meal time, so that symptoms occurring in non fasting patients cannot rule out the diagnosis of insulinoma.In a series of 214 insulinoma patients with a reliable clinical history, symptoms of hypoglycaemia were reported exclusively in the fasting state in 73%, postprandial state in 6%, and both fasting and postprandial state in 21% (Placzkowski et al. 2009).Weight gain is found only in 25% of patients.Rapid (or rarely delayed) resolution of symptoms after glucose administration is part of Whipple's triad, which makes the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia when it has been assessed reliably; the triad comprises clinical symptoms of hypoglycaemia, the finding of a low plasma glucose concentration at the time of clinical symptoms, and subsiding of clinical symptoms after glucose administration.In rare pregnant patients with insulinoma, symptoms may resemble those of emesis in early pregnancy and may subside in late pregnancy as a consequence of insulin resistance, then are unmasked after delivery (Diaz et al. 2008), as reported in a patient who presented with coma and clonic seizures 14 hours after delivery (Christiansen & Vestergaard 2008). Biological diagnosis of insulinomas Plasma glucose concentrationsSince the clinical symptoms lack diagnostic specificity, measurement of plasma concentration of glucose is mandatory (ideally at the time of occurrence of clinical symptoms) and must be performed in venous blood samples with a reliable laboratory method.In order to avoid pseudohypoglycaemia, i.e. a consequence of glucose metabolism by blood cells in the tube containing the blood sample, the blood sample should be collected in a tube with a glycolysis inhibitor (NaF).Glucose concentrations are measured using reference method with hexokinase.",

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

This is to a great extent due to a decreased brain plasticity affecting the formation of memory traces for different sensory stimuli essential for different cognitive operations of the brain. Furthermore, MMN can serve as a measure of recovery or neural reorganization in different neurological disorders. For example, the recovery from aphasic symptoms after stroke was associated with the enhancement of MMN. MMN has also been useful in determining neural plastic changes of the auditory system associated with cochlear implantation.",

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

      "abstract": "Hunger und andere Formen der Mangelernahrung konnen verschiedene Konsequenzen fur den Organismus nach sich ziehen, wie zum Beispiel eine Herzinsuffizienz, eine Fettleber, Formen der Protein-Energie-Malnutrition wie Kwashiorkor und Marasmus und schlimmstenfalls den Tod. Bisher weniger grundlich untersucht sind die Folgen extremer Unterernahrung fur die Psyche. Menschen, die unter Hunger leiden, wirken antriebs- und kraftlos und lethargisch. Man konnte vermuten, dass sie depressiv sind. Aber erfullen sie wirklich die Diagnosekriterien einer klinischen Depression? Die Beantwortung dieser Frage konnte wichtige Hinweise darauf bergen, welche langfristigen Konsequenzen etwa auf eine Hungersnot oder ein weiteres Ansteigen der Pravalenz der Anorexia Nervosa folgen konnten. Dies konnte sowohl relevant fur die Arbeit von Arzten, Oecotrophologen, Psychologen und anderen therapeutischen Berufsgruppen sein als auch, auf einer globalen Ebene, bedeutsame Informationen fur die okonomischen Folgen beinhalten, die auf eine von Mangelernahrung betroffene Gesellschaft zukommen. So konnte eine durch Hunger induzierte erhohte Depressionspravalenz weitere Kosten fur das wahrscheinlich ohnehin gebeutelte Gesundheitssystem eines betroffenen Staats nach sich ziehen. Zudem ist es fur Menschen, die zusatzlich zu den korperlichen Entbehrungen des Hungers unter Symptomen der Antriebslosigkeit, Hoffnungslosigkeit, Interesse- und Freudlosigkeit leiden, um einiges schwerer, Kraft und Motivation fur den Wiederaufbau eines Landes zu finden. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschaftigt sich daher damit, ob Mangelernahrung zum Entstehen einer Depression fuhrt und welcher Art die gefundenen Symptome sind. Mangelernahrung ist ein weltweit verbreitetes Phanomen, das verschiedene Ursachen haben kann. Wahrend Hunger ein groses Problem in armeren Landern darstellt, entwickeln vor allem in den industrialisierten Landern immer mehr Menschen Essstorungen. Die in dieser Arbeit formulierten Hypothesen wurden anhand einer Zusammenfassung der Literatur und der wichtigsten Studien uberpruft. Es wurde gefunden, dass Mangelernahrung nicht zu einer klinisch diagnostizierbaren Depression, aber dennoch zu ausgepragten depressiven Symptomen fuhrt, die sich nach einer Normalisierung der Nahrungsaufnahme zuruckbilden. Diese Auswirkungen beschranken sich nicht auf einen somatischen Symptombereich, sondern finden sich ebenso in psychischen und kognitiven Gebieten. Weitere insbesondere experimentelle Forschungsarbeiten zur Kontrolle dieser Ergebnisse waren wertvoll fur die Weiterentwicklung des Verstandnisses der Interaktion von Mangelernahrung und Symptomen psychischer Erkrankungen.",

Diese können auch ohne den Nachweis einer substanziellen Hirnschädigung in der neuropsychologisch zu erwartenden Region auftreten. Als Ursache für diese Diskrepanz gelten neuroinflammatorische Prozesse und oxidativer Stress. Am häufigsten sind das verbale Gedächtnis, visuell-räumliche Fähigkeiten, das Gedächtnis für visuelle Inhalte, Aufmerksamkeit, Arbeitsgedächtnis, Exekutivfunktionen (Planung, Kontrolle, Problemlösung, Aufmerksamkeit, Entscheidungsfindung), die allgemeine kognitive Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit und die sprachliche Domäne betroffen. Es zeigt sich, dass das Vorhandensein kognitiver Beeinträchtigungen einen wesentlichen Risikofaktor darstellt, nicht mehr beruflich reintegriert werden zu können. Zusätzlich zu den kognitiven Symptomen treten nach einer aSAB auch gehäuft psychiatrische Symptome wie Angst, Depression und Fatigue auf. Diese wirken sich zusätzlich zu den körperlichen und kognitiven Beeinträchtigungen negativ auf die Teilhabe am beruflichen und sozialen Leben aus, was wiederum zu einer schlechteren Lebensqualität beiträgt.",

One of the most common causes of these symptoms are vascular pathologies, including inflammatory and thrombotic, immunologic and atherosclerotic changes. Neuropsychiatric complications may present as a single symptom or might form a syndrome. In a particular patient, a syndrome might change its form in time, presenting itself as a different syndrome. Quite a lot of these symptoms are not a result of a disease itself but its treatment, metabolic abnormalities, arterial hypertension or infection. Steroids play a particular role in the induction of these complications. The role of increasingly used biological agents is uncertain. The most frequent psychiatric manifestations of the connective tissue diseases are: benign behavioural changes, emotional instability and sleep impairment. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are most frequently seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (up to 80% of these patients), particularly with the co-existent antiphospholipidsyndrome. Psychoses with or without seizures are included in the diagnostic criteria of the disease. A separate clinical problem is an induction of a synthesis of autoantiobodies by some drugs, including psychiatric drugs. These antibodies induce clinical symptoms of an autoimmune disease only in some patients, most frequently the symptoms of lupus erythematous, co called: drug induced lupus, including arthralgia, myalgia, fever, skin lesions and serositis. The diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric complications of autoimmune diseases is quite complicated. It is extremely important to distinguish whether a particular symptom is primary to the disease itself or secondary to its treatment. The most important recommendations are treatment of the underlying disease, its exacerbations and chronic phase, and prevention and treatment of vascular problems.",

      "abstract": "One of frequent presentations of multiple sclerosis (MS) is chronic fatigue that may be determined as a subjective decrease of the physic and/or psychic energy level. Fatigue can be divided into asthenia (fatigue in resting state), pathological fatigability (exhaustion during physical loading) and fatigue concomitant with other symptoms (MS exacerbation). There are central as well as peripheral mechanisms of fatigue formation. Frequent is a combination of fatigue and affective disorders in MS, in particular depression, as well as sleep disturbances (insomnia, restless legs syndrome) that may indicate the common origin of their mechanisms, i.e. reduction of serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems activity. Endocrinal and autoimmune components are considered as important in fatigue syndrome formation, the latter exerting more influence on asthenia than on pathological fatigability. Further investigation into pathogenetic mechanisms of asthenia (fatigue in resting state), pathological fatigability (fatigue in active state) and specification of their differential diagnostic features allow not only to understand the essence of this syndrome but to choose an adequate individualized therapy.",

      "title": "Hyperglycaemic Dissociative Fugue in an Elderly- A Rare Case Report",
      "abstract": "This case report highlights the role of hyperglycaemia in a dissociative syndrome that may be overlooked by physicians, until it results in significant consequences. Traditionally dissociation is considered as an escape from overwhelming distress with partial or complete loss of control on voluntary actions or alienation of oneself or external world [6]. Possible biological factors implicated in pathogenesis include reduced perfusion in inferior prefrontal and anterior temporal regions in the right hemisphere and abnormal functioning of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal dysfunction, Glutamate/N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor, Serotonin (5-HT2a, 5-HT2c), Gama-Amino Butyric Acid (GABA), and Opioid receptors[7, 8].\r\nThough diabetes may impair attention, speed of information processing, motor skills, working memory, the mechanism involved in the occurrence of dissociative fugue is unknown [9]. NMDA receptor that plays important role in cognitive impairment in other disorder (e.g. Alzheimer dementia) appears to play a role in causation of dissociative symptoms. Diabetes can induce NMDA receptor subunit composition resulting in cognitive impairment, and NMDA-receptor antagonists have shown to improves cognitive in over activation [10,11].On other hand activation of NMDA receptors in the dorsal vagal complex lowers glucose production, and it involved in glucose stimulated insulin secretion from beta cells [12]. Role of GABA and 5HT2 is unclear. The activation of GABA (A) receptors decreased insulin secretion and GABA (B) receptor antagonist increase insulin release in islets type 2 diabetic[13] .GABA synthesis is impaired in hyperglycaemic state [14,7].GABA-A antagonism and 5-HT2a/2c agonism can induce dissociative-like symptoms [15]. 5-HT2A receptors are implicated in the molecular mechanisms of anti-diabetic medication16.Hyper activation of the HPA axis is also reported in diabetes [5].Thus in isolation or in combination of above pathophysiology, hyperglycaemic state may result in dissociative symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Objective: This review focuses on syncope in diabetic patients who suffer from hypoglycemia. Clinically, transient loss of consciousness during hypoglycemia appears similar to vasovagal syncope. Research Design and Methods: Current understanding of this problem is based on physicians’ personal experiences as well as on published case reports. It is difficult to explain a temporary loss of consciousness as a result of hypoglycemia. Demonstration that hypoglycemia can be transient, with the patient suffering from neuroglycopenia without autonomic symptoms due to delayed counterregulation, might be a first step in confirming that a diabetic patient suffered from a transient loss of consciousness with spontaneous recovery. Results: Hypoglycemic syncope is uncommon, affecting 1.9% of diabetic patients using insulin therapy. It is characterized clinically by brief periods of unconsciousness with slow recovery and without loss of postural muscle tone. The difficulty in correlating loss of consciousness to hypoglycemia arises from mismatching symptoms, that is, there may be mental symptoms such as confusion, loss of memory or consciousness, in the absence of autonomic manifestations such as sweating or blurred vision. There are currently no established glucose values that define the level of hypoglycemia that causes loss of consciousness. Conclusion: Hypoglycemic syncope should be suspected in older diabetic patients with preserved postural tone, usually but not always using insulin therapy, who show a slow recovery from transient loss of consciousness with persisting neurological impairment and low blood glucose levels.",

      "abstract": "Muscle weakness has a multitude of causes. Some involve genetic or metabolic disturbances affecting the muscle directly, some are caused by interruptions to the transmission of impulses at the neuromuscular junction, still others by abnormalities in the muscle nerve supply. Disuse atrophy with profound weakness may be seen in advanced arthritis or in any other condition where chronic pain enforces immobility. There are numerous uncommon syndromes in which muscle weakness is an important component; many of these will come to a specialist neurologist for elucidation. Some weakness is temporary, recovery of strength often occurs in stroke or very commonly in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Cranial motor and peripheral muscular dysfunction in myasthenia gravis may respond to steroids, immuno-suppressants and either plasma exchange or immunoglobulin infusions as well as thymectomy and the use of pyridostigmine. There are presentations of ‘functional’ weakness (often unilateral and sometimes accompanied by sensory symptoms) commonly of prolonged duration, that are little altered by treatment of any kind, but are not readily assigned to any recognizable neurological diagnosis. This group of disorders reminds us that weakness is a subjective as well an objective and measurable symptom.",

Cerebral palsy affects two to three children per 1,000 live-born. Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life. Methods used, based on clinical kinesiology, and appropriate exercise and modification, kinesitherapy has positive effects in treating the condition of people with cerebral palsy",

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is defined as difficulties of initiating and maintaining sleep, early awakening and poor subjective sleep quality despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep with impairment of daytime performance. These components of insomnia – namely persistent sleep difficulties despite of adequate sleep opportunity resulting in daytime dysfunction - appear secondary or co-morbid to neurological diseases. Comorbid insomnia originates from neurodegenerative, inflammatory, traumatic or ischemic changes in sleep regulating brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei with consecutive changes of neurotransmitters. Symptoms of neurological disorders (i.e motor deficits), co-morbidities (i.e. pain, depression, anxiety) and some disease-specific pharmaceuticals may cause insomnia and/or other sleep problems. This guideline focuses on insomnias in headaches, neurodegenerative movement disorders, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, epilepsies, stroke, neuromuscular disease and dementia. The most important new recommendations are: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBTi) is recommended to treat acute and chronic insomnia in headache patients. Insomnia is one of the most frequent sleep complaints in neurodegenerative movement disorders. Patients may benefit from CBTi, antidepressants (trazodone, doxepin), melatonin and gaba-agonists. Insomnia is a frequent precursor of MS symptoms by up to 10 years. CBTi is recommended in patients with MS, traumatic brain injury and. Melatonin may improve insomnia symptoms in children with epilepsies. Patients with insomnia after stroke can be treated with benzodiazepine receptor agonists and sedating antidepressants. For patients with dementia suffering from insomnia trazodone, light therapy and physical exercise are recommended.",

The relationship of anosognosia to other behavioral disorders is complex. Many authorities view the phenomenon as part of the spectrum of the neglect syndrome. Others emphasize the parallels between anosognosia and confabulatory behavior. Anosognosia also bears some resemblance to disorders of body schema such as asomatognosia or autotopagnosia. Several descriptions of anosognosia were published before Babinski coined the term in 1914 (Babinski, 1914). As introduced, anosognosia referred only to lack of awareness or recognition of a specific neurologic disturbance (i.e., hemiparesis). Subsequently, the term has been applied more broadly to describe unawareness of any neurological or neuropsychological deficit (Fisher, 1989). A wide variety of clinical syndromes have been associated with anosognosia, including visual loss (hemianopia or cortical blindness), amnesia, dementia, aphasia, cortical deafness, movement disorders (hemiballismus, chorea, tardive dyskinesia), apraxia, and thought disorders associated with schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Motivation – the capacity to experience enthusiasm for achieving a goal, which helps to initiate, guide and maintain behaviour – is a fundamental psychological process that serves to enable both survival and thriving in the face of challenge. Loss of motivation can have a debilitating impact on everyday function, resulting in difficulty working, studying and taking care of responsibilities at home; and, in extreme cases, a total loss of motivation results in the absence of any behaviour at all. Disrupted motivation can be expressed through a variety of clinical symptoms, including apathy, anhedonia and fatigue, which tend to cluster together. These motivational symptoms are very common, occurring across a broad range of neuropsychiatric conditions, for example depression, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease, but as yet we have no specific treatments for them. This chapter provides an introduction into research into the neuroscientific and psychological mechanisms underlying motivation, which has yielded important information regarding the key brain circuity and cognitive operations involved. There are several key messages. (i) Motivation is a multifactorial construct, comprising several distinct cognitive operations, and dysfunction in any one of these has the potential to result in motivational symptoms.",

Depressive Disorders, according to the DSM-5 Classification by the American Psychiatric Association, include, among others: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, and Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. The occurrence of Depressive Disorders causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning across various areas of life (personal, familial, social, and occupational). Therefore, depression in old age should not be analyzed without considering the individual and social aspects of an elderly person’s functioning. However, it is important to remember to consider its symptoms as a disease and not to misinterpret them as symptoms of the aging process. Bipolar and Related Disorders occur relatively rarely in old age; however, mild depression or depression with symptoms that do not form a complete syndrome is observed more frequently. Such diagnoses justify prioritizing psychotherapeutic interventions or potentially combining them with pharmacotherapy. CBT therapy is an effective way to support older people with depressive disorders in their recovery.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by delusion, hallucination, formal thought disorder, disorganized or catatonic behavior, negative symptoms (e.g. emotional blunting, decreased initiative, impoverished speech etc.) and cognitive dysfunction. Though not described as diagnostic criteria, cognitive dysfunction is the strongest determinant of functional recovery as it has a gradual deteriorating effect on social and occupational functioning. It precedes coincides and outlasts positive symptoms. Among different cognitive abilities it affects attention, memory, processing speed, social cognition and executive function most. Recent studies are showing schizophrenia affects those who have compromised cognitive function or low IQ. Moreover different brain imaging techniques have shown structural and functional abnormality in certain areas. This article has tried to answer few questions like, are cognitive dysfunctions inevitable in schizophrenic patients and if it is then what are the areas what is the nature of affection. It is also important to know how and why they affect the long term outcome of this disorder.",

      "title": "Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",
      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

      "abstract": "La discapacidad intelectual (DI) o trastorno del desarrollo intelectual (TDI) es uno de los principales trastornos del neurodesarrollo y afecta al 2% de la poblacion, es decir, a mas de un millon de personas en Francia. Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica. La evaluacion periodica y multidimensional de las competencias cognitivas, escolares, socioemocionales y adaptativas a lo largo de la vida permite comprender mejor el funcionamiento de las personas con una DI y prever estrategias adecuadas de aprendizaje, tratamiento, acompanamiento y apoyo para una mejor calidad de vida y participacion en la vida de la sociedad.",

      "abstract": "Background: In some medical cases, psychotic symptoms can be part of the clinical picture, and sometimes it can even be the only clinical appearance of the medical condition. Psychotic disorders secondary to organic pathologies affecting the central nervous system are called psychotic disorders due to a general medical condition. While some of these secondary causes can easily be detected by laboratory and imaging methods, anamnesis or neurological examination (substance use, trauma, and tumors), others are often overlooked in the presence of rare medical conditions (autoimmune disease and viral encephalitis), when laboratory and examination findings are not clear and psychiatric symptoms are in the foreground. Case Presentation: In this case, we tried to reveal the differential diagnosis and treatment processes of a patient who was admitted to the emergency department with psychotic symptoms, such as agitation, aggression, and paranoid delusions, and was admitted to the psychiatry clinic after an urgent medical evaluation. After his admission to the psychiatry clinic, the medical evaluation of the patient was re-evaluated in detail due to memory and orientation deterioration, and as a result, clinical pictures such as Hashimoto’s encephalopathy, herpes encephalitis, and epileptic seizures were found to be together in the patient. As a matter of fact, both general medical and psychiatric statuses of the patient improved with the application of low doses and short-term antipsychotic treatment for psychiatric symptoms together with the treatment for this underlying general medical condition. Conclusion: Since the treatment of psychiatric symptoms caused by secondary medical factors is quite different from the treatment of primary psychiatric disorders, it is important to make full medical evaluations, especially in patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms for the first time or presenting with emergency psychiatric symptoms.",

A combination of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors could be traced in depression etiology. Depression affects various parts of the brain, becoming hypoactive and/or hyperactive. Various functions are impaired in depression due to the deregulated secretion of brain neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors. Moreover, it leads to immune system dysfunction and structural brain alterations. Therefore, administering proper and effective treatment for depression requires comprehensive knowledge of its underlying causes. All in all, the overview of the role of different brain areas and some of their influencing factors could be beneficial for the treatment of depression.",

Coma is a severe state of cerebral dysfunction resulting from either structural, chemical, electric, or toxic disorders of the brain. Coma is potentially reversible and life threatening and should be treated as a medical emergency. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is often used to describe a person's level of consciousness after injury or medical event. Brain death is the determination of death by neurological criteria. Components of the brain death determination process include a clinical exam documenting the complete absence of all brain stem reflexes and an apea test documenting absent respirations in the setting of hypercarbia. The emotional and psychosocial impact of death is always stressful for those who survive the patient; this can be even more difficult in the setting of brain death.",

Emotional hypersensitivity might be linked with: a history of neglect, rejection and abuse; insult; changes which are forced or not under control of the psychopath; obstacles that prevent the psychopath to do what he or she wants to do; narcissistic injury; broken friendships or relationship. Normal emotional functioning might be associate with grief, warm relationship, adequate attention, disease, academic and/or occupational success, impressive events, confrontations, contemplation and maturation, hidden suffering (also as a result of neurobiological determination).",

Imbalance of neurotransmitters, particularly of the dopaminergic system, accounting for the often dramatic clinical features, has been uncovered and is successfully repressed by dopamine antagonists [5, 26].

Imbalance is caused by profound neuronal dysfunction due to neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative dysregulation and is also detectable in less spectacular and therefore initially often ignored symptoms [36, 38]. In fact, a remarkable worsening of cognitive/mental performance can be observed during early episodes of the psychosis [20, 36], supporting the concept of a major neuronal damage occurring at that time.",

The most common findings in patients with spinal emergencies are pain, motor deficits, sensory deficits, abnormal reflexes, and urinary dysfunction. Acute back pain is the only symptom of catastrophic spinal emergencies such as spinal hemorrhage or infection. Sudden paralysis can result from trauma, cord infarction, or hemorrhage. Even though a thorough sensory examination in the emergency department is often difficult and unreliable, complexes of sensory and motor abnormalities are helpful. As a result of the anatomical distribution of upper and lower motor neurons, acute spinal cord lesions almost always present with hyperreflexia. The mechanism of urinary incontinence depends on the type of lesion. Spinal cord emergencies frequently go unrecognized initially or are misdiagnosed even with such obvious symptoms as the inability to walk or bladder function failure.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a natural phenomenon of giving adequate rest to the body and mind. Insomnia is the inability to fall asleep at night for many hours or inability to have a sound sleep, which deprives one of natural rest and interferes with activities during the day. Each of us has suffered a restless night at some point in our lives. We’ve all occasionally sacrificed sleep for a cram session before an exam, or an important deadline. Many of us also know the feeling of losing sleep due to an intense emotional upset or the accumulation of stress or anxiety. For some of us, loss of sleep is short-lived; for others, it is chronic and we’ve come to anticipate losing sleep on a regular basis. Insomnia can be caused by elevated or chronic stress, illness, physical discomfort, environmental factors, changes in our schedules, side effects from prescribed medications, depression, anxiety, and…",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring in patients with acute or chronic liver diseases are usually summarized as hepatic encephalopathy. Encephalopathy that occurs in the patients with acute hepatic insufficiency or in the terrain of cirrhosis Is defined as acute hepatic encephalopathy. Degree of alteration in mental functions is highly variable. Minor deficits could be measured and detected by sophisticated psychometric or electroencephalometric tests (subclinical encephalopathy). As well as in other organic psychosyndromes hallucinations and confabulations can be present in the same time deficits of attention, emotions, psychomotor behavior, memory, or inversion of sleep wake cycle, which can lead to hepatic coma. In the early stages of hepatic encephalopathy behavior disturbances are usually present, therefore are treated with tranquillizers, especially benzodiazepine anxiolitycs which could precipitate cerebral dysfunction. It is of importance to stress that patients with hepatic encephalopathy are highly susceptible to exogenous and endogenous benzodiazepines, which Is one of the factors of disability of neurotransmission balance. Therefore use of benzodiazepines with long half life in plasma and active metabolites, is contraindicated in the patients with, liver cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy, because of the possibility of progression toward hepatic coma. On the basis of gabaergic hypothesis of pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, benzodiazepine antagonists could be useful in the treatment. Flumazenil which posses high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors and is used for that purpose. Severe behavioral disturbances and delirium induced by hepatic encepahlopathy have been successfully treated by our clinical experience with chlormethiazole.",

      "title": "Cell-based therapies for neural replacement strategies in stroke-related neurodegeneration: neurophysiological insights into stem progenitor cell neurogenesis within a host environment",
      "abstract": "The restricted neurogenesis limits the brain ability to overcome neuronal cell death following ischemic lesion: Failure of the damaged brain to regenerate following cerebral ischemia results in functional deficits those are most often irreversible and can further deteriorate, causing mortality and severe disability, progressive memory loss and cognitive impairments, known as dementia. This is caused by massive neuronal cell death and neurotoxicity following limited blood supply to the brain. Ischemic death of brain neurons (acute or delayed after lesion) has been the etiology of vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Multiple types of vascular dementia exist, common in cognitive decline that gradually worsens and variable in where strokes happen (subcortical dementia) or how severe lesions are (e.g., major stroke, series of small strokes or brief transient ischemic attacks). It has emerged a synergistic combination of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease that often comes (mixed dementia). For over the last three decades after the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death had been discovered, intense research has been focused on withdrawing or, at least, attenuating neurodegeneration to improve restoring function in experimental models of post-stroke cognitive impairments while mimicking focal ischemia, permanent or transient brain lesions, hypertension or reproducing Alzheimer's disease combined with vascular pathology [for review (Hainsworth et al., 2017)]. Long-standing perspectives that ischemic neuronal death might be potentially suspended through activation of endogenous neuroprotection stay with genomic reprogramming and/or gene activation for de novo protein synthesis, relied on the hypoxia-activated signaling pathways (Dirnagl et al., 2009). On the other hands, pre-clinical studies, including our own works (Kopach et al., 2016; Rybachuk et al., 2017), have reported functional impairments at the later times (weeks) post-ischemia (as in principal neurons as within network), with controversial effectiveness of pharmacological therapeutics utilized after lesion. Unfulfilled regeneration convinces experimental neuroscientists to focus on cell-based therapies for neuronal replacement strategies used to overcome massive neuronal loss in the brain tissue subjected to ischemia. The major issue, however, remains how this therapy should be utilized in order to promote beneficial effects timely, namely via engraftment of neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) or already differentiated stem cell-derived neurons into the damaged brain. From that, the other conceptual question arises regarding the regulatory role of a host environment in either NSPC neurogenesis or functional integration of the grafted stem cell-derived cells. If choose the latter, what 'proper' proportion of the entirely different phenotypes needs to be grafted to possibly succeed? More insights into this are essential when considering cell therapy while aiming at remodeling of the damaged post-stroke brain from mixed stem cell-derived cells for restoring the broken functionality of such a complex tissue as the brain. NSPC grafts mature neuronal phenotype within a host tissue in a weeks' time: The survival rate of differentiated stem cell-derived cells grafted into the organized brain tissue has been routinely low – this suggests a strong regulatory role of the host environment in the viability of stem cells. As an alternative, grafting NSPCs could potentially promote the multipotent stem cell differentiation and subsequent maturation of the entirely different phenotypes, regulated by endogenous environment, to pave the way towards 'self-repair' of damaged tissue while engaging the endogenous mechanisms of self-renewal. However, discoveries in this field are hampered by technical challenges and controversy in clinically translatable advances. Eventually, the enormous potential of stem cell therapy has been evidenced for post-stroke recovery (Tornero et al., 2017) while its neurophysiological basis has been much less learned thus far. Repeatedly reported common patterns of firing and synaptic activity have been recorded from the stem cell-derived neurons at the very end time-points – typically few months after transplantation – that fosters underestimation of the time-dependent neurophysiological integration of differentiated cells into the host tissue. In our recent study, we have traced the time courses of maturation and integration of the NSPC-derived neurons into the host circuits, demonstrating their matured excitability and synaptogenesis (to the level of endogenous principal neurons – CA1 pyramidal neurons) within 3 weeks or less in situ (Kopach et al., 2018). To neurophysiological point of view, biophysical properties (Na+/K+ conductance, capability for high-frequency firing, characteristic excitatory transmission) make these cells physiologically credible those are capable to constitute specified relationships with other cells, providing functional impact. This also points out the accelerated rate of neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts in situ when compared with much longer time required to achieve similar patterns of activity by stem cell-derived neurons in vitro (Morgan et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2012; Telezhkin et al., 2016). For restorative neuroscience, a query remains to precisely define the timing of NSPC-derived phenotypes mature and set the appropriate activity within the damaged, pathophysiological environment. Establishing this is primary to enabling the assessment of timing for emerging beneficial effects, to design and rationale further reaching perspectives for accelerating stem cell neurogenesis while considering replacement strategies for various post-stroke brain regions (subpopulations of neurons, other neural cell types). Post-ischemic environment regulates neurogenesis of NSPC grafts: An in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia provides technological advantages for feasibly exploring the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death together with managing therapeutic approaches for targeted interventions in the organized brain tissue. In translational neuroscience, this methodology benefits with a meaningful consideration of variable experimental modifications utilized to mimic ischemic insult and onset of cell therapy (depending on how severe and complex the ischemic impairments are, diverse stem cell origin, etc.). In our study of an in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia optimized for a delayed death of principal neurons [within 2 weeks instead of acute CA1 neuronal death (Rybachuk et al., 2017)], we have traced the functional properties of NSPC grafts over the time in the hippocampal tissue subjected to ischemia (Figure 1; Kopach et al., 2018). The post-ischemic environment influenced neurogenesis of NSPC grafts in different ways. Neuronal maturation has been delayed, both excitability and synaptogenesis, at each time points tested (for over 3 weeks in total; Figure 1). Instead, multipotent NSPC differentiation has been prompted towards the non-neuronal phenotype – we have identified the NSPC-derived glial cells as fast as within a week in the post-ischemic tissue. Such principal difference in the stem cell fate between control and post-ischemic environments implies the determinant, yet underestimated, regulatory role of the host tissue in neurogenesis of NSPCs, both differentiation profile (neuronal vs. non-neuronal) and neurophysiological maturation.Figure 1: The experimental scheme of neural stem progenitor cell (NSPC) administration in an in situ model of stroke.A carton shows the time course for functional assessment of the NSPC-derived neural maturation in a host tissue (organotypic hippocampal tissue subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation of 10 minutes duration, with onset of the therapy after 2 hours (h) of re-oxygenation). W: Week(s).Endogenous facilitators of stem cell fate: Ischemic cell damage results in the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity followed by massive neuronal death and overwhelmed neurotoxicity. Ultimately, different signaling molecules and mediators are released those levels became dramatically heightened, overloading the extracellular matrix and activating a vast majority of signaling pathways, with an immense variety of molecular mechanisms being involved. Moreover, during neuronal cell death, necrotic, pro-apoptotic factors and mediators of inflammation activate pro-inflammatory signaling, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and others, pertinent to overactivated astrocytic response featuring the post-ischemic brain. Numerous signaling cascades can, thus, contribute to how the ischemia-subjected environment governs the fate of NSPC grafts. The notable regulatory roles in stem cell differentiation have been evidenced for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), Ca2+-dependent Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), and Wnt signaling pathways in in vitro and in vivo studies, among the involved cAMP, protein kinase C (PKC) and CaMK pathways, and phospholipase C and D signaling activation (Le Belle et al., 2011; Telezhkin et al., 2016). Therefore, pharmacological or genetic manipulations modulating presently dissecting signaling pathways, providing multiple growth facilitators, such as neurotrophins, to support intrinsic growth capacity of differentiating neurons, neutralizing high levels of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the post-ischemic tissue can accelerate neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts. Further, the supposed beneficial effects may include neurogenesis of the resident neural stem cells of the brain for activating endogenous self-renewal. By contrast, the non-neural (glial) NSPC differentiation, prompted up in the post-ischemic tissue, assumes the ROS-mediated regulation of NSPCs. The activated Notch signaling eliciting the latent neurogenic program in astrocytes after stoke (Magnusson et al., 2014) may have a synergistic effect on the post-ischemic NSPC differentiation to astrocytes. Functional restoration via multipotent NSPC function: Outcome after cell therapy is mediated by diverse mechanisms underlying functional improvements in the post-stroke recovery. Our study implies that NSPC therapy comprised primarily of promoted neurogenesis to a glial lineage that emerges shortly after initiating the therapy in the ischemia-subjected brain tissue (Kopach et al., 2018). This initial stage includes supplying the damaged tissue with the NSPC-derived astrocytes and oligodendrocytes – the output assuming the glia-related neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. The stem cell-derived astrocytes enhance the viability of brain cells by secreting various neurotrophic factors and supporting cell regeneration, evidenced for improving neurological function of post-stroke brain (Jiang et al., 2013), whereas oligodendrocytes' role has been proven in re-myelination and axon regeneration, both essential to synaptic networking (Figure 2). Such glial-directed differentiation of NSPC grafts, driven by overactivated master regulators that heavily burden the post-ischemic tissue, may mirror endogenous mechanism of boosting the glia-mediated tissue clearance following ischemic neuronal cell death. As the cellular debris became cleared and pro-apoptotic and inflammatory mediators recede, multipotent NSPC neurogenesis towards neuronal maturation takes place, which is the longer lasting process. Indeed, the ability of multipotent stem cells to mature with higher efficacy to neurons in astrocyte co-cultures had been evidenced. Other roles of glial cells have included the active astrocytic contribution to synapse formation, plasticity and remodeling that should facilitate network remodeling in the post-stroke tissue.Figure 2: The current concept of NSPC-therapy in stroke-related neurodegeneration encompasses the multipotent differentiation of NSPC grafts in a host tissue for replacement of various neural phenotypes after ischemia-induced cell loss for restoring the function in multiple ways.Conclusions and future perspectives: Ischemia-induced neuronal cell death is one of the leading causes of the brain damage that results in high rate of mortality and severe disability in patients after stroke (series of strokes). The stroke-related neurodegeneration gives rise to numerous neurological disorders, including cognitive decline (vascular dementia), motor disability (paralysis), and others associated with a wide range of impairments. Massive neuronal death after stroke could be barely overcame only by pharmacological interventions, but requires also implementation of cell therapies for replacement strategies. Although the long history of stem cell research had provided conceptual advances and clinical relevance of cell-based therapy, it has been less understood the neurophysiological basis of such tremendous effects of stem cells on the post-stroke recovery of brain function. Because recovery of the brain is not a single process, it is essential to clearly define the precise timing required for maturing of neurophysiological activity, ranging from intrinsic excitability to network function, for the entirely different stem cell-derived phenotypes. Dissecting this will expand the knowledge about stem cell therapy to find how best to use multiple routes of the therapy (induced pluripotent or embryonic stem cells) for the stroke-related neurodegeneration. More work is needed on defining the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell neurogenesis to provide the field with a meaningful consideration of cell therapy in context of promoting 'self-repair' of the post-stroke brain by engaging endogenous brain recovery mechanisms to power self-renewal. The perspective remains in accelerating neurophysiological maturation of neuronal phenotypes in the post-ischemic tissue tailored to enhancing the functional influence and, thereby, maximizing beneficial effects. Understanding the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell grafts will foster cell therapy use to augment therapeutic interventions in stroke-related neurodegeneration and to improve ultimate outcome.",

      "title": "Dysautonomias: Clinical Disorders of the Autonomic Nervous System",
      "abstract": "The term dysautonomia refers to a change in autonomic nervous system function that adversely affects health. The changes range from transient, occasional episodes of neurally mediated hypotension to progressive neurodegenerative diseases; from disorders in which altered autonomic function plays a primary pathophysiologic role to disorders in which it worsens an independent pathologic state; and from mechanistically straightforward to mysterious and controversial entities. In chronic autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson disease), orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure from sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after “patchy” autonomic impairment or blood volume depletion or, as highlighted in this discussion, from a primary abnormality that augments delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart. Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys seems to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm that is associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, which rationalizes treatment with β-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between the chronic fatigue syndrome and orthostatic intolerance; however, treatment with the salt-retaining steroid fludrocortisone, which is usually beneficial in primary chronic autonomic failure, does not seem to be beneficial in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Dysautonomias are an important subject in clinical neurocardiology.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a broad term, usually referring to any psychiatric disorder in which there is a loss of reality testing, which is generally reflected by the presence of delusions, hallucinations, and/or severe thought disorder and may entail serious behavioral disturbances. In individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), reports of psychosis have included cases that would meet criteria for delirium, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, or major depression. The greatest interest, however, has been generated by the association between TBI and schizophrenia-like psychosis (Krafft-Ebing 1868), and this is the focus of this chapter. The most important question is whether TBI predisposes an individual to schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis. If this association can be unequivocally established, a number of other issues become relevant, such as the prevalence of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI, its clinical features, risk factors, and prognosis. An important corollary is whether the study of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI can advance the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.",

It is more difficult to offer a comprehensive clinical definition of epileptic seizures and epilepsy because of the varied clinical manifestations produced by cerebral neuronal discharge. However, an epileptic seizure can be defined as an intermittent and stereotyped disturbance of consciousness, behaviour, emotion, motor function, or sensation that on clinical grounds is believed to result from cortical neuronal discharge. Epilepsy can then be defined as a condition in which seizures recur, usually spontaneously. The differential diagnosis of epilepsy is large because of the enormous range of symptoms that can occur during seizures. Inevitably, the differential diagnosis for tonic-clonic seizures is very different from that for simple partial seizures with autonomic symptoms. The most common clinical problem is the differential diagnosis from other causes of transient loss of consciousness associated with collapse, the commonest cause of which is syncope.",

      "title": "Transient epileptic amnesia",
      "abstract": "Transient epileptic amnesia is an adult onset form of temporal epilepsy which is characterised by recurrent acute seizure-induced amnesia often accompanied by ongoing memory disturbances of autobiographical, topographical amnesia and accelerated long-term forgetting. The first case report of transient epileptic amnesia was described more than a hundred years ago. However, more extensively investigations of this type of epilepsy were started not long ago. In 1998 diagnostic criteria were formulated: 1) history of recurrent witnessed episodes of transient amnesia; 2) cognitive functions other than memory are judged to be intact during typical episodes by a reliable witness; 3) evidence for a diagnosis of epilepsy, provided by one or more of the following: (a) wake or sleep electroencephalography; (b) the co-occurrence of other seizure types (if their roughly concurrent onset and/or close association with episodes of transient amnesia suggested a connection); (c) a clear-cut response to anticonvulsant therapy. From case reports that are analysed in literature it is not difficult to summarise clinical characteristics: transient epileptic amnesia usually starts later in life, more often in men than in women; amnestic episodes are brief, recurrent and often occur upon waking; memory loss is usually mixed type with anterograde and retrograde amnesia; in 65% of patients amnesia is associated with gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, déjà vu, a brief period of unresponsiveness, automatisms; epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography were seen in 43% cases; although transient epileptic amnesia has an excellent response rate to anticonvulsant therapy, between episodes patients still suffer from accelerated long-term forgetting, remote memory impairment and topographical amnesia. Differential diagnostic of transient epileptic amnesia is diverse and diagnosis is usually inaccurate and overdue. Treatment with monotherapy often helps totally prevent recurrence of attacks. In the paper we review two case reports of patients with transient epileptic amnesia.",

The clinic is different according to the antineuronal Ac involved. Objectives To make a correct differential diagnosis between autoimmune encephalitis and primary psychiatric pathologies that may be similar in symptoms through a complete study of the patient including anamnesis, physical examination, imaging tests, cerebrospinal fluid and serum studies. Methods Description of a clinical case. A 31-year-old female patient, with no previous history of interest, was brought to the emergency department for a suspected seizure. The previous days she had presented emotional lability, difficulty in concentration and reading, blurred vision, confusion and hemicranial headache. Two days later she returned to the emergency room for insomnia, dysarthria, difficulty in reading, comprehension, naming, and excessive rumination of her problems. Incoherent and repetitive language. The Emergency service requested to rule out a conversive disorder. Results Neuropsychiatric manifestations (anxiety, depression, behavioral disturbances, insomnia, memory deficits, psychomotor agitation, mania, auditory and visual hallucinations, delusions) are the first symptom in 70% of autoimmune encephalitis due to anti-NMDA antibodies and usually respond poorly to psychiatric treatment, making the treatment of the primary cause necessary for the remission of these symptoms. Conclusions Given their increasing recognition and prevalence, autoimmune causes should always be taken into account in behavioral changes, cognitive or consciousness impairment of subacute installation, especially in young patients and once infectious, metabolic and vascular causes have been ruled out with an appropriate complementary study.

The clinical features of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion often show the symptoms of cognitive impairment and organic psychosyndromes.

Each therapy has an influence on the biochemical and pathophysiological alterations caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion can be used with reason in these disorders. The mechanism of action of vinpocetine is interfering on many aspects with the biochemical and pathophysiological processes attributable to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, independently of the original alteration responsible for hypoperfusion. This fact might give an explanation on the beneficial effect of vinpocetine on clinical signs and symptoms of chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency.",

Survivors often face lifelong impairments affecting functional status, cognition, and mood. Depression, the most common mood disorder affecting TBI survivors, most likely is underdiagnosed and presents differently than primary depression or depression after other brain insults. Unfortunately, few studies have been reported that advance theoretical perspectives on post-TBI depression. Currently, there is some evidence that neurochemical and anatomical changes contribute to post-TBI depression. Interpersonal factors, such as sense of belonging and social support, may contribute to the incidence of post-TBI depression. Because of limited theoretical viewpoints, advances have not been made in cost-effective and efficient interventions for this mood disorder, which prolongs rehabilitation and contributes to family suffering.",

Though the underlying mechanism still remains unclear, there are two assumptions explaining the associations between somatic symptoms and depression. One is that depression itself causes several somatic symptoms. That is, people with depression may express their mental conflicts in various somatic symptoms. This hypothesis could apply especially to those who have a vague feeling of stigma or prejudice against mental disorders, and who are reluctant to frankly express their mental symptoms. From another point of view, this might mean that some chronic somatic symptoms are magnified due to the person’s depressive state. Another possible hypothesis is that those who have had chronic somatic symptoms of unknown origin, in other words, functional somatic symptoms, are likely to be depressed since they cannot always receive effective medical treatment for such symptoms.",

      "title": "Physiological Basis of Memory Dysfunction in Alzheimer’s Disease – An Overview",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neuro-degenerative disease, causing gradual decline in memory function in the affected patients. The loss of memory makes their existence miserable. It is first noticed and reported by the patient’s care takers. The clinicians objectively assess the type and degree of the memory loss by a specific battery of tests, specially designed for the purpose (like Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test., Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE etc.)). Understanding the symptoms of AD, arising out of memory loss, requires deeper insights into what initiates the memory (the sensory inputs from the five sense organs), the different types of memories (explicit, implicit memories, their sub types and associative memory etc.), how the memory signals are modified at the level of the neuron, (analog to digital signals) and the synapse (sensitization, habituation and Long term potentiation / depression etc.), the processing that the inputs received , undergo (encoding, consolidation /organization, storage and retrieval) in higher brain centres (amygdala, hippocampus prefrontal vortex etc.) and also the role played by the various receptors (NMDA, AMPA and the kinase receptors), the neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, Norepineprine, Gama aminobutic acid, serotonin etc.), the central network systems involved (central executive network, salience network, and the default mode network). In short, it is the study all about, of the physiology of memory. The next step is to integrate this knowledge to interpret symptoms of patients with AD. Accordingly, the subject under discussion is dealt with in two parts. Firstly, how the memory is affected in AD and secondly the physiology behind these changes.",

      "abstract": "Alexithymia is a tendency to experience psychological distress in the form of somatic symptoms. Alexithymia is a syndrome that is defined by the inability to recognize and express emotions. It is a common feature in patients with psychoactive abuse disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and psychosomatic disorders such as gastrointestinal complaints, migraine, dermatological symptoms, and irritable bowel syndrome. Alexithymia is associated with a failure to use adaptive affect regulation such as modulating arousal, appropriately expressing or suppressing emotions, tolerating painful emotions and cognitive assimilation. Alexithymia is presumed to play a very important role in the pathogenesis of medically unexplained physical symptoms and it is a risk factor for a psychosomatic condition. It is of clinical importance that the majority of patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms are able to recognize that their physical symptoms may be related to their depression or anxiety disorder which are the most common mental disorders.",

Depending on the presenting and early symptoms, patients with these disorders are often referred to psychiatrists or general, movement disorder and/or behavioral neurologists. Clinicians need to be aware of these conditions in order to know when to consider and test for them, as many are treatable if not reversible. Improved awareness and understanding of these disorders will help with early identification and prompt treatment, thereby reducing long-term morbidity and mortality. This chapter will focus on the most common autoimmune, especially antibody-mediated, syndromes associated with psychiatric and movement disorders. Many of the autoimmune-mediated movement disorders discussed in this chapter are often associated with other features, including psychiatric/behavioral disorders, limbic encephalitis, and other symptoms. Autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE) is a syndrome in which parts of the limbic system are involved and classically presents with features including short-term memory loss, irritability, depression, hallucinations, sleep disturbances, and/or seizures.",

      "title": "The Morbidity of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is one of the most significant of human behaviors, occupying roughly one-third of human life. Sleep disorders are one of the most common clinical problems encountered in outpatient settings and inpatient settings. Lack of sleep can lead to the inability to concentrate, memory complaints, and deficits in neuropsychological testing. Additionally, sleep disorders can have serious consequences, including fatal accidents related to sleepiness. Disturbed sleep can be a primary diagnosis itself or a component of another medical or psychiatric disorder. Narcolepsy is plausibly caused by an abnormality of REM-inhibiting mechanisms, and recent research involving hypocretin, a neurotransmitter, suggests that hypocretin is significantly reduced in narcolepsy patients. Patients with delayed and advanced sleep phase insomnia can be treated with proper timing of bright light and behavioral changes. Hypersomnia related to a mental disorder is usually found in a variety of conditions such as the early stages of mild depressive disorder, grief, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and somatoform disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In contrast to many clinical pain syndromes, wherein a medical history and physical examination usually lead to the diagnosis of a structural lesion or biochemical alteration, the functional pain syndromes are without fixed organic peripheral changes. The functional pain disorders include fibromyalgia (FM), atypical facial pain (also termed idiopathic facial pain), non-specific low-back pain (NSLBP), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and are characterized by their persistence, intractability, and apparent absence of peripheral disease. Various psychiatric designations have been applied to pain disorders that are characterized by medically unexplained symptoms: somatization, somatoform disorders, psychogenic disease, chronic multisymptom illness, affective spectrum disorders, and central sensitization syndromes as well as functional disorders (Barsky &amp; Borus, 1999; Clauw &amp; Chrousos, 1997; Clauw et al.,1997; Hudson et al.,1992; Hudson &amp; Pope, 1989; Wessely et al.,1999). A functional disorder is one that, after appropriate medical assessment, cannot be explained in terms of a conventionally defined medical disease based on biochemical or structural abnormalities (Derbyshire et al.,2004; Wessely et al.,1999; Drossman et al.,2000).Although these disorders are routinely assessed and viewed as separate clinical entities, combining these systemic and regional conditions in a review is justified by several observations: (1) there is considerable overlap in the case definitions of specific syndromes, (2) the disorders co-aggregate in individuals, (3) patients with different syndromes share non-symptom characteristics, (4) the functional syndromes all respond to similar therapies, (5) the syndromes share common neurobiological mechanisms, such as abnormal sensory processing, neuroendocrine, and autonomic dysfunction (Wessely et al.,1999),",

However, the study of how anesthetic drugs cause amnesia, and importantly how they fail, has received less attention than the other cardinal properties of anesthesia. There is no reliable biomarker to determine the adequacy of pharmacologic amnesia in real time. Anesthetic drugs can influence all stages of memory formation and recall, and their amnestic effects are dissociable from their hypnotic effects; for example, propofol has potent specific amnestic potential, whereas dexmedetomidine is a pure hypnotic. Post-traumatic stress disorder cluster symptoms, which constitute a disorder of amygdala-centered memory systems, are commonly related to surgical memories under both general anesthesia and procedural sedation and need to be better understood and managed.",

      "title": "Orthorexia nervosa – a different lifestyle or a specific eating disorder?",
      "abstract": "Orthorexia nervosa (ON) is considered an obsession with healthy eating, a phenomenon that includes excessive dietary restrictions, which in turn can lead to metabolic dysfunctions. Although the nosological status of this pathology is currently insufficiently determined, ON attracts the interest of mental health specialists due to the possible harmful psychological and biological consequences, its high prevalence in the general population and the difficulty of adequate therapeutic management (low level of insight and lack of evidence-based treatments). Orthorexia nervosa should be distinguished from other mental disorders with which it has a high degree of clinical overlap (obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, restrictive/avoidant eating disorder etc.), but also from “healthy orthorexia” (this being considered part of a lifestyle focused on eliminating foods labeled as “impure”, “toxic” or “artificial”). The analysis of risk factors for ON highlights the importance of several obsessive-compulsive personality traits (perfectionism, rigidity, self-control), executive dysfunctions, internalization of social models (thinness or perfect health, for example), media pressure, parental and social group influences, belonging to certain professional categories (nutritionists, medical students, athletes) or practicing yoga. Several psychometric instruments for measuring the severity of ON have been developed over the last two decades, but they should be used with caution because not all of them have well-established validity. Also, several sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed in order to identify the clinical features of orthorexia nervosa and to differentiate these patients from those diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, somatoform disorders or nonpathological orthorexic behaviors. Finally, some therapeutic suggestions are presented, mainly psychotherapies, but it should be mentioned that they are based on case studies or on the extrapolation of data from trials dedicated to pathologies considered to be related to orthorexia nervosa. In conclusion, because ON is a nosological entity that has only recently been cornered, there is an urgent need to explore psychometric tools with higher specificity and to find more widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Also, no clear, evidence-based therapeutic recommendations could yet be formulated, because no clinical trial focused on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with orthorexia nervosa has been conducted.",

The validity of the diagnoses is defended by (a) pointing to the for centuries existing tradition of the disease conditions, (b) their likely aetiology in the context of (repeated) situations of learned helplessness, stress, and trauma, and (c) and a downregulation of emotional reactivity. Dissociative amnesia is defined as a memory blockade, usually induced by an adverse environment for which appropriate coping strategies are lacking. The influence of a lack of psychic wellbeing on the brain is worked out by pointing to results from structural and functional brain imaging and by using the examples of Takotsubo‐cardiomyopathy and transient global amnesia. Concomitant psychiatric disease conditions and specific personality traits of patients with dissociative amnesia are discussed. It is concluded that dissociative amnesia is a valid concept with distinct neural correlates that withstands the criticisms of a few experimental psychologists.",

      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia afflicts millions of people in the United States. It is associated with decreased quality of life, accidents, several comorbid conditions, increased morbidity, and substantial direct and indirect costs. Chronic insomnia is a multifactorial and individualized disorder. Its etiology may be cognitive or physiologic in nature (or both), and is more often than not associated with a comorbid condition, complicating its recognition, evaluation, and treatment. Effective nonpharmacotherapeutic (cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia) and pharmacotherapeutic (hypnotic medications) treatment modalities are available. Treatment of chronic insomnia can make a significant improvement in quality of life, and may also be associated with an improvement in comorbid conditions.",

      "title": "[Suggestion of a new diagnostic category: posttraumatic embitterment disorder].",
      "abstract": "Psychological reactions to negative life events have been among the most interesting subjects to researchers for a long time. In recent years post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies. This disorder is defined as a reaction to an event that is accepted as traumatic by almost everyone, to an extraordinary life-threatening event, or to a disaster. Psychological reaction to events, which are not directly life threatening, is classified as adjustment disorder and is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice. As a result of experiencing such non-life threatening events, PTSD is claimed to be an adjustment disorder as well. Immigrants frequently report a depressive state in which physical symptoms are in the foreground accompanied by social withdrawal and diminished energy. Negative life events, which are not life threatening and are not experienced everyday, can impair mental health so that the above state may worsen and an immigrant may have a reduction in his performance at work. This state, which is accompanied by such symptoms as embitterment, feelings of injustice, repeated intrusive memories of critical events (injustice at work place, loss of a job, discrimination in a public office, etc.), phobic symptoms, and avoidance behavior towards the place or persons related to the event, might best be described by the term, posttraumatic embitterment disorder (PTED). This disorder, which was initially described in immigrants from East Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall, and which does not exactly match the diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder or PTSD, is presented in a case vignette and its differential diagnosis is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Delirium, also called as organic brain syndrome, acute brain syndrome, acute brain failure, acute confusional episode and reversible or masked dementia, as a concept, stretches back to the age of Hypocrates (Burns et al., 2004).Delirium is described as a condition characterized by a disturbance of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Classification of M e n t a l D i s o r d e r s , F o u r t h E d i t i o n , T e x t R e v i s i o n ( D S M -I V -T R ) c r i t e r i a ( A m e r i c a n Psychiatric Association, 2000).Also, delirium involves a change in cognition (such as memory deficit, disorientation, language disturbance) or the development of a perceptual disturbance that is not better accounted for by a preexisting, established, or evolving dementia (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).In addition to these, impairment in the brain's ability to integrate perceptions correctly, coupled with memory deficits and confusion may result in psychotic symptoms in delirium.Hallucinations (especially visual and tactile), delusions, paranoia, illusions, and bizarre behavior are the commonly encountered psychotic symptoms in delirium (Leigh, 2008).Delirium is associated with longer hospital stay, poorer functional outcome, and cognitive decline in addition to an elevated morbidity and mortality.Despite these adverse outcomes, delirium recognition rates are low (12-43%) and its management remains inadequate in up to 80% of patients (Morrison et al., 2003).These findings suggest lack of preventive and screening activities, missed diagnoses, and inappropriate management of diagnosed delirium (Michaud et al., 2007). Epidemiology PrevalenceThe prevalence of delirium varies with the population that is being studied (Fong et al., 2009).Delirium is a relatively common disorder, especially in older people with physical illness (Saxena & Lawley, 2009).Community rates of delirium are reported to vary from 0.4% to 2% (Saxena & Lawley, 2009, Fong et al., 2009).In general hospital setting prevalence of delirium has been reported to range from 11% to 33% on admission (Lindesay et al.,",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a sleep disorder in which you having trouble in falling and/or staying asleep. The condition can be short-term (acute) or can last a long time (chronic). Acute insomnia lasts from 1 night to a few weeks. Chronic Insomnia - it happens at least 3 nights a week for 3 months or more. Insomnia may be a contributory factor in the development of a wide range of mental health problems. Primary causes of insomnia include stress due to a job loss or change in bad habits. A secondary cause of insomnia includes mental health issues like depression and anxiety, Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. Psychotic experiences commonly occur in mild forms and have been linked to disrupted sleep. Chronic insomnia higher rates in patients with comorbid conditions (e.g., hypertension, 44%; cardiac disease, 44.1%; breathing problems, 41.5%) it is glopally. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapeutic treatment; CBT for insomnia (CBTI) targets those behaviours, cognitions, and associations and is effective across a variety of populations, including those with medical and psychological comorbidities. CBT-I is a collaborative process and the skills learned in sessions require practice. The Society of Behavioural Sleep Medicine (www.behavioralsleep.org) and the American Board of Sleep Medicine also approved this type of treatment for Insomnia.",

Neurohospitalists are often asked to determine the etiology of the patient's altered state and to provide prognostic information and treatment recommendations. This review addresses the common syndromes associated with consciousness disorders, including coma, vegetative and minimally conscious states and syncope. A comatose patient, by definition, has eyes closed with no response to voice or pain and no comprehensible speech or awareness of self and surroundings. Patients typically evolve into a chronic disorder of consciousness, often initially a vegetative state and then potentially into a minimally conscious state. Syncope is a rapid-onset and self-limited loss of consciousness which is typically accompanied by loss of postural tone. Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a clinically defined condition with abrupt onset of anterograde and variable retrograde amnesia lasting up to 24 hours.",

Als alterstypische psychische Stoerungen koennen am ehesten diejenigen Erkrankungen angesehen werden, die auf einer organischen Stoerung der Hirnfunktion beruhen. Bei den akuten Stoerungen stehen das Delir und das akute amnestische Syndrom im Vordergrund, die wichtigste Krankheitsgruppe bei Aelteren stellen jedoch die dementiellen Entwicklungen mit einer vielgestaltigen Symptomatik dar. Charakteristisch fuer eine dementielle Entwicklung sind unter anderem Beeintraechtigungen des Gedaechtnisses und des Denkvermoegens sowie Veraenderungen der Persoenlichkeit. Zur Diagnostik ist neben der psychiatrischen Exploration und der koerperlichen Untersuchung eine testpsychologische Quantifizierung des kognitiven Leistungsvermoegens erforderlich. Haeufigste Ursache dementieller Erkrankungen sind degenerative Prozesse, insbesondere die Alzheimer-Demenz. Der psychiatrische Sachverstaendige hat zur Beurteilung der strafrechtlichen Verantwortlichkeit zunaechst zu untersuchen, welche konkreten Auswirkungen die Diagnose auf die Funktionsfaehigkeit des Betroffenen hat. Erst dann erfolgt die Uebersetzung psychiatrischer Befunde und Diagnosen in ein System juristischer Begrifflichkeiten auf der Grundlageder Paragraphen 20/21 des Strafgesetzbuches (StGB).

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

Erkrankungen des autonomen Nervensystems können im peripheren oder zentralen Nervensystem primär (z. B. Primär autonomes Versagen) oder sekundär im Rahmen einer systemischen Erkrankung (z. B. Diabetes mellitus, Morbus Parkinson) entstehen. Die häufigsten autonomen Störungen sind Kreislaufregulationsstörungen und stehen oft im Mittelpunkt der Diagnostik. Diese betreffen primär oder in ihren Auswirkungen fast alle medizinischen Disziplinen. Im neurologischen Krankheitsspektrum stehen insbesondere die Parkinsonsyndrome, die Multisystematrophie und die Small fibre Neuropathien im Focus der Aufmerksamkeit hinsichtlich der Veränderungen der Kreislaufregulation mit orthostatischer Hypotonie oder dem zusätzlichen Vorkommen einer Liegendhypertonie. Sorgfältige Anamnese und apparative Diagnostik sind neben der klinischen Untersuchung unabdingbar. Die weiterführende Diagnostik umfasst neben bedside tests wie den Schellong-Test verschiedene standardisierte Untersuchungsmethoden im autonomen Funktionslabor wie die Kipptischuntersuchung oder die Analyse der Herzfrequenzvariabilität. Die hohe Variabilität des autonomen Nervensystems aber auch der angewandten diagnostischen Methoden und Messplätze macht eine Standardisierung dieser Techniken notwendig. Hierfür stellen Leitlinien, Konsensusempfehlungen, SOPs usw. eine besondere Hilfe dar. In der Therapie werden bei hypotonen Kreislaufregulationsstörungen neben physikalischen Maßnahmen verschiedene Pharmaka erfolgreich eingesetzt, die jedoch nur unzureichend erstattungsfähig sind.",

This disorder, known as autotopagnosia, is often accompanied by other cognitive deficits, such as a general difficulty in naming things, known as an anomia, or a difficulty understanding any words that refer to concrete as opposed to abstract concepts. If autotopagnosia is accompanied by these kinds of problem, then it is possible to argue that it is caused by a general difficulty with word names or an inability to understand the meaning of concrete words. There are cases, however, in which patients can name body parts on their own bodies when these parts are pointed to by the examiner, although they cannot point to their own body parts on command or point to their own body part that corresponds to a numbered part on a picture of a body. These autotopagnosias cannot be caused by verbal deficits, but some patients with this pattern of disorder also have difficulty pointing, on verbal command, to parts of inanimate objects. As such patients are also unable to relate a well-known story in logical sequence, it has been argued that autotopagnosia is caused by a general inability to analyse a whole into its component parts.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that result from progressive damage to cells and nervous system connections that are essential for mobility, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognition. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Neurological disorders are disorders that involve the brain, spinal cord or nerve and muscle. Children with neurological disorders may have disorders such as epilepsy, developmental delay, cerebral palsy, meningitis, genetic/metabolic diseases or diseases of muscle or nerve such as muscular dystrophy or peripheral neuropathy. These illnesses are frequently severe and potentially have long lasting consequences for the affected children. The pathologies most frequently responsible for psycho-physical disorders can be summarized into three groups: collaboration difficulties (autism spectrum disorders, intellectual impairment, phobia); motor dysfunction (cerebral palsy, epilepsy, other brain pathologies, neuromuscular disorders), and craniofacial anomalies (Down syndrome, other genetic syndromes). Due to their clinical history, and the lack of collaboration, in pediatric non-cooperative patients with Special Needs (SN), the anesthesiological risk may result difficult to assess, despite the fact that they meet the criteria of the outpatient management applied for the patient without disabilities. The perioperative management of pediatric patients with psycho-physical disorders with related relational and cognitive problems must be carefully planned, in order to make the entire hospitalization process as comfortable and as less traumatic as possible. General anesthesia is the most suitable type of anesthesia in pediatric patients with Special Needs (SN), although anesthetic complications are more frequent in these patients, mainly due to comorbidities, taken drugs and anatomical peculiarities. Some studies observed no correlation between multiple anesthesia exposures and neurodevelopmental deficits, while others reported that even a single exposure could increase the risk of deficits. An increased risk of developmental or behavioral disorders as the consequence of surgeries requiring general anesthesia was observed. Based on current studies, it is necessary to endeavor to limit the duration and numbers of anesthesia and the dose of anesthetic agents. The evaluation must include history and physical examination pertaining to the conditions requiring special anaesthetic considerations. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing these neurological disorders in pediatric patients to improve overall quality of life and long-term outcomes.",

      "title": "AGMATINE AMELIORATES SOCIAL ISOLATION INDUCED OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR IN MICE",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is defined as recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses (obsession) and/or repetitive purposeful behaviors (compulsions). 13% of children and adults are suffering from this condition. There are evidences that increased OCD symptom severity has been linked with diminished quality of life [3] and also increased functional impairment. Social isolation is defined as a state in which the individual lacks a sense of belonging socially, lacks engagement with others, has a minimal number of social contacts and they are deficient in fulfilling and quality relationships.Social isolation (SI) causes a variety of behavioral changes like hyper-locomotion, anxiety, impulsivity, aggression. These behavioral abnormalities in rodents may be related to the symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, schizophrenia, depression. In addition, Social isolation and OCD are associated with similar neurochemical changes like hypofunction of serotonin, dopamine and glutamate hyperfunction.These changes might be one of the causes for exacerbation of OCB in social isolation. Agmatine [4(amino butyl) guanidine] is an endogenous amine, widely present in mammalian brain and proposed as a novel neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.It is a metabolite of L-arginine via arginine decarboxylase and hydrolyzed to putrescine and urea by agmatinase. Recently, Agmatine is evidenced for anti-compulsive like effect . It has also been reported for its effectiveness in schizophrenia , addictive behavior , stress,anxiety [11] and depression . Besides this, Agmatine is evidenced for modulating levels of serotonin [13] as well as dopamine and glutamate levels .Incidentally, these neurotransmitters levels are altered in social isolation and OCD. [14] Hence, in the present study, the effect of agmatine was investigated in social isolation induced OCD in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Animals Adult male albino Swiss mice (22–25 g) were group housed (n=6) under a standard 12 h light/dark cycle and controlled conditions of temperature (23 ± 2C) and humidity (55 ± 10%). Mice were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 7 days before carrying out the experiments. The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) (SCOP/IAEC/2013/14/151). Drugs Agmatine sulfate was purchased from SigmaAldrich Ltd., USA. Drug solutions were prepared fresh and doses are expressed in terms of their free bases. Isolation condition Mice were housed singly in cages (21 x 38 x 14 cm) under a controlled 12-hour/12-hour light-dark cycle, Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts (obsessions), repetitive ritualistic behaviors (compulsions) and excessive anxiety. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is classified as an anxiety disorder under DSM-IV-TR guidelines. In OCD, the levels of serotonin and nitric oxide decreased; whereas levels of dopamine and glutamate increased in brain. Environmental conditions such as isolation from social surroundings lead to anxiety and increased level of aggression. The present study was designed to examine the effect of agmatine in social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior on marble burying behavior and locomotor activity. Agmatine (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered in different groups of mice; activity was observed 30 min after dosing. Acute treatment of agmatine (40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced marble burying behavior. Moreover, hyperlocomotion was observed in socially isolated animals and agmatine was found to attenuate the same without affecting basal locomotions. In conclusion, agmatine effectively decreases social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior in mice.",

Initial brain bioelectrical activity characterized by the first developing symptoms of drowsiness or passive awaking condition promotes the reaction development. But emotional tension or somatic activation interfere this process. This dependence could be remedied by increasing of biological significance of low intensity EMF and changing of the analyzed physiological parameter.",

Typically this is manifested by amnesia and either the development of alternate identities or an estrangement from one's own identity. Spontaneous and self-generated dissociative states and phenomena sharing much in common with those that can be induced with hypnosis are thought to play a major role in their development, symptomatology, and perpetuation. Medical heterohypnosis offers a powerful tool to reestablish a functional continuity of memory and identity in many such cases. The application of hypnotic interventions in the treatment of such conditions will be discussed, explored, and illustrated with clinical vignettes.",

      "abstract": "There is reason to presume the existence of an epileptological disease entity called 'common generalized epilepsy' (CGE) with generalized-synchronous seizure discharges and strictly nonfocal seizures (petit mal, grand mal, myoclonus) occurring chiefly in the age range from 4 to 16 years. There is no evidence of causative pathology. The basic functional disturbance is likely to involve arousal mechanisms ('dyshormia') and/or photosensitivity. The genetic factor is highly complex. This entity must be differentiated from electrically or epileptologically very similar conditions. Among 300 epileptics with predominantly generalized seizure discharges in the EEG, only 20% (61 patients) fell into the category or 'pure' CGE; another 24% (72 patients) were listed as atypical CGE and showed additional minimal focal abnormalities or evidence of insult to the brain in the history. Other conditions giving rise to generalized seizure discharges are hereditary essential myoclonus epilepsy (Lafora-Unverricht-Lundborg), deep seated lesions (hypothalamus, mesencephalon) and metabolic disturbances; this group amounted to no more than 4% (12 patients). A primary cortical epileptogenic focus giving rise to 'secondary bilateral synchrony' was presumed in 9% (26 patients). A large group of 125 patients (42%) were characterized by slow spike-wave complexes and mental retardation (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome). The 4 remaining patients (1%) had slow spike-wave complexes but represented an unusual type of post-traumatic epilepsy without the ictal-clinical symptomatology of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The physiopathogenesis of CGE and its generalized seizure patterns is discussed.",

      "abstract": "The development of psychotropic chemotherapy with widespread use in the psychiatric clinic for its anxiolytic, hypnotic, antidepressant, psychostimulant or psycho-destructive sedative effects has given rise to a new pathology secondary to increased abuse and accessibility. Their neurotropism is generally exerted on the central nervous system at the level of the complex meso-diencephalo-striate structures, influencing the elementary psychic functions, but also the activity of the whole organism through the neuro-humoral system. The clinical investigation of the patient must be interdisciplinary in nature, as human beings are characterized by a bio-psycho-social unit, in which the various biological and psychological components, influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the social environment, are involved in a special way, which gives an original personality to everyone. There are five fundamental axes, which are usually evaluated: thinking, memory, attention, emotion and behavior. A disorder in any of these axes, intense enough to interrupt the normal activity in more than one operating field over a sufficiently long period of time, is diagnosable as a mental disorder. There is an indication borrowed from internal medicine regarding the acute character (weeks), subacute character (months) and chronic character (years), which is attached to the diagnosis. A small part of the entire psychiatric population suffers from severe conditions, which involve intermittent episodes of severe disinhibition, aggressive behavior and self- or hetero-directed violence. In most cases, we talk about conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders (panic disorder, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder), which do not make him a social predator, although they cause enormous suffering to the individual. This study includes 67 patients with mental illness. While conducting the study, we took into account that the first contact with the patient is essential for the results of the anamnesis, oral examination, risk assessment and provisional treatment plan. In the 67 cases there were performed mycological analyses. It is necessary that dentists have certain knowledge of psychology and psychopathology, in order to understand the mechanism of psychopathological reactions and avoid them.",

      "abstract": "Systemic infection is often revealed by or associated with brain dysfunction, which is characterized by alteration of consciousness, ranging from delirium to coma, seizure or focal neurological signs. Its pathophysiology involves an ischemic process, secondary to impairment of cerebral perfusion and its determinants and a neuroinflammatory process that includes endothelial activation, alteration of the blood–brain barrier and passage of neurotoxic mediators. Microcirculatory dysfunction is common to these two processes. This brain dysfunction is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and long-term cognitive disability. Its diagnosis relies essentially on neurological examination that can lead to specific investigations, including electrophysiological testing or neuroimaging. In practice, cerebrospinal fluid analysis is indisputably required when meningitis is suspected. Hepatic, uremic or respiratory encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, drug overdose, sedative or opioid withdrawal, alcohol withdrawal delirium or Wernicke's encephalopathy are the main differential diagnoses. Currently, treatment consists mainly of controlling sepsis. The effects of insulin therapy and steroids need to be assessed. Various drugs acting on sepsis-induced blood–brain barrier dysfunction, brain oxidative stress and inflammation have been tested in septic animals but not yet in patients.",

      "abstract": "There are many patients with chronic pain who are referred from each of the clinical fields to the department of psychosomatic medicine. Various psychosocial stress factors participate in the onset of chronic pain. Psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, anger, depression, hypersensitivity, or irritation, are often related to the onset of chronic pain and change the state of illness. Chronic pain of the musculoskeletal system is often a pathologic reaction against the stress. Because a correlation between physical symptoms and psychological stress factors has been observed, chronic pain can be regarded as a representative form of psychosomatic disease. To improve efficacy in the medical treatment or psychotherapy, it is important to understand the psychosocial condition of chronic pain through sufficient history taking or appropriate psychological tests. For the pharmacological treatment of such chronic pain modified with psychosomatic factors, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be more effective than general analgesics or physical therapy. Holistic and specialized approaches, such as cognitive therapy or behavioral therapy, may be necessary for the treatment of chronic pain related to improper recognition, obsessive ideas or misunderstanding of the problems.",

      "abstract": "Online dictionaries provide a suggestive translation for the burnout concept: \"The tubes burned out easily and had to be constantly replaced...\".This is the sequence of events that leads to the syndrome: the depletion of one's own intellectual energy, usually directly tied to the profession one has, presumably exerted with great passion and dedication, after a long lasting effort.The most accurate definition, including the eventual prophylactic actions to be taken, is based on the context in which this syndrome manifests: the surpassing of one's resistance to professional effort and of one's capability to recuperate (1,17).Its manifestation, perceived by others and by the affected individual consists of behaviors and feelings, more or less subjective, noticed by the individual and/or those around him/her.The most common symptoms overlap those found in various types of depression: fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood, lack of pleasure and motivation for daily activities concerning -surprisinglythose linked to professional activity.Other symptoms are included in the psychosomatic category: headaches, lumbago, gastrointestinal problems, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, various cenesthetic complaints.If we use the word symptoms we must include our description in the biological model, which is not necessary the case here.Official psychiatric classifications do not recognize burnout as a form of depression.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10, 1992) (2) includes this syndrome in the last chapter (amongst \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" codes Z00-Z99, in \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" code Z73.0 together with other \"problems\", such as \"Accentuation of personality traits\" including type A behavior pattern, \"Lack of relaxation and leisure\", \" Stress, not elsewhere classified\", \"Inadequate social skills, not elsewhere classified\", \"Social role conflict, not elsewhere classified\", ranging from Z73.1 to Z73.5), all of which do not refer to nosological entities, but to particularities varying with context and eventually with the individual's psycho-social vulnerability.We can thus define burnout as a cumulation of psychological symptoms, more or less interchangeable with the psychiatric equivalents, already indexed among the diagnostic criteria of some psychiatric disorders (exhaustion depression, stress disorders etc.) (3).It is true that, given time, these psychological symptoms and disfunctions can translate to actual depressive symptoms.Because burnout is, in fact, a surpassed work-related state, it is wise to be aware that the onset of the symptoms might show a change in the individual's professional life.This means that the professional act, which one performs with a",

Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination.

Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them.

      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

      "title": "Aphasia from a Neurolinguistic Perspective",
      "abstract": "Aphasia is an acquired language disorder subsequent to brain damage in the left hemisphere. It is characterized by diminished abilities to produce and understand both spoken and written language compared with the speaker’s presumed ability pre-cerebral damage. The type and severity of the aphasia depends not only on the location and extent of the cerebral damage but also the effect the lesion has on connecting areas of the brain. Type and severity of aphasia is diagnosed in comparison with assumed normal adult language. Language changes associated with normal aging are not classed as aphasia. The diagnosis and assessment of aphasia in children, which is unusual, takes account of age norms. The most common cause of aphasia is a <italic>cerebral vascular</italic> <italic>accident</italic> (CVA) commonly referred to as a <italic>stroke</italic>, but brain damage following traumatic head injury such as road accidents or gunshot wounds can also cause aphasia. Aphasia following such traumatic events is non-progressive in contrast to aphasia arising from brain tumor, some types of infection, or language disturbances in progressive conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, where the language disturbance increases as the disease progresses. The diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia (as opposed to non-progressive aphasia, the main focus of this article) is based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria by M. Marsel Mesulam, in 2001. Inclusion criteria are as follows: Difficulty with language that interferes with activities of daily living and aphasia is the most prominent symptom. Exclusion criteria are as follows: Other non-degenerative disease or medical disorder, psychiatric diagnosis, episodic memory, visual memory, and visuo-perceptual impairment, and, finally, initial behavioral disturbance. Aphasia involves one or more of the building blocks of language, phonemes, morphology, lexis, syntax, and semantics; and the deficits occur in various clusters or patterns across the spectrum. The degree of impairment varies across modalities, with written language often, but not always, more affected than spoken language. In some cases, understanding of language is relatively preserved, in others both production and understanding are affected. In addition to varied degrees of impairment in spoken and written language, any or more than one component of language can be affected. At the most severe end of the spectrum, a person with aphasia may be unable to communicate by either speech or writing and may be able to understand virtually nothing or only very limited social greetings. At the least severe end of the spectrum, the aphasic speaker may experience occasional word finding difficulties, often difficulties involving nouns; but unlike difficulties in recalling proper nouns in normal aging, word retrieval problems in mild aphasia includes other word classes. Descriptions of different clusters of language deficits have led to the notion of syndromes. Despite great variations in the condition, patterns of language deficits associated with different areas of brain damage have been influential in understanding language-brain relationships. Increasing sophistication in language assessment and neurological investigations are contributing to a greater, yet still incomplete understanding of language-brain relationships.",

Poststroke dementia or post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSD/PSCI) is a form of cognitive disturbance caused by cerebrovascular disease that can manifest at different times after a stroke, including during the acute phase of stroke, during the recovery phase (while motor stroke symptoms improve), or months and years later. The onset of cognitive impairment depends on the location of infarct. Infarct in certain locations have cognitive impairment as a sole presentation from the outset. Infarcts in the left frontotemporal lobes, right parietal lobe, and left thalamus are notably correlated with cognitive impairment following a stroke. In the former, patients present with complains of motor difculties as the main complain. In addition to these locations, vascular lesions in the thalamo-perforating area of the PCAmay cause dementia and other forms of severe memory loss. Abaseline (pre-morbid) and early post-stroke (early post-morbid) cognitive status should be evaluated and a protocol for the same is needed in regular clinical and ICU care facilities. MoCA assessment is commonly used for cognitive assessment. Its role in strategic infarcts is undermined as it leaves out the evaluation of symptoms corresponding to common strategic infarct locations such as the medial temporal lobe and thalami. There is a need for dedicated neuropsychological assessment score based on education level, and native-language for PSCI.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is characterized by chronic widespread pain, unrefreshing sleep and mental/physical fatigue. Most patients report additional somatic and psychological symptoms. Fibromyalgia is a heterogeneous condition. The definite aetiology of this syndrome remains unknown. A model of interacting biological and psychosocial variables in the predisposition, triggering, and development of the chronicity of fibromyalgia symptoms has been suggested. Depression, genetics, obesity combined with physical inactivity, physical and sexual abuse in childhood, sleep problems, and smoking predict future development of fibromyalgia. Psychosocial stress (working place and family conflicts) and physical stress (infections, surgery, accidents) might trigger the onset of chronic widespread pain and fatigue. Mental disorders have a negative impact on the clinical outcome. Several factors are associated with the pathophysiology such as alteration of sensory processing in the brain, reduced reactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis to stress, increased pro-inflammatory and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokine profiles, disturbances in neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, and small fiber pathology. Prolonged exposure to stress, as outlined above, may contribute to these functional changes in predisposed individuals. The prevalence in the general German population is about 2 %. The clinical diagnosis is established by the history of the key symptoms and the exclusion of somatic diseases sufficiently explaining chronic widespread pain. For management, the German evidence and consensus based guideline recommends a stepwise approach according to the severity of FMS. All patients should receive adequate education about the disorder and its management. Non-pharmacological therapies such as low intensity aerobic exercise and meditative movement therapies such as Qi-Gong and Yoga are highly recommended for long-term self-management. Drug therapy is not mandatory. Recommended drugs are the antidepressants amitriptyline and duloxetine and the anticonvulsant pregabalin which act as pain modulators.",

Causal pathologies are either cerebral or general. The most common is the stroke, especially if it is haemorrhagic. If the seizure is delayed in relation to stroke, it defines vascular epilepsy and is an indication for long-term antiepileptic therapy. Neurodegenerative diseases, primarily Alzheimer's disease, are associated with epilepsy, but the pathophysiological links between the two are poorly understood. The clinical presentation of seizures is often atypical and the existence of memory disorders complicates the diagnosis because they make it difficult to reconstruct the anamnesis. Cranial trauma and tumours are the other classic brain causes of epilepsy. The general causes include metabolic and hydroelectrolytic disorders (especially hypoglycaemia and hyponatremia), drugs (either by their toxicity or by a withdrawal syndrome), and uraemic encephalopathy of renal failure. Finally, alcohol is a common cause not to be neglected, including among institutionalised patients.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Neuropathic pain, or pain associated with disease or injury to the peripheral or central nervous system, is a common symptom of a heterogeneous group of conditions, including diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, postherpetic neuralgia and spinal cord injury. Chronic neuropathic pain should not be thought of as a symptom. It should truly be thought of as a disease with a very complicated pathophysiology. Pathophysiology. The mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain are complex and involve both peripheral and central pathophysiologic phenomenon. The underlying dysfunction may involve deafferentation within the peripheral nervous system (e.g. neuropathy), deafferentation within the central nervous system (e.g. post-thalamic stroke) or an imbalance between the two (e.g. phantom limb pain). Clinical characteristics. Neuropathic pain is non-nociceptive, in contrast to acute nociceptive pain, and it can be described as ?burning?, ?electric?, ?tingling?, and ?shooting? in nature. Treatment. Rational polypharmacy is often necessary and actually it is almost always the rule. It would be an exception if a patient was completely satisfied with his treatment. Treatment goals should include understanding that our patients may need to be titrated and managed with more than one agent and one type of treatment. There should be the balance of safety, efficacy, and tolerability. Conclusion. There are many new agents and new applications of the existing agents being currently studied which will most certainly lead to even more improved ways of managing this very complicated set of disorders.",

      "title": "The Nature of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population.

      "abstract": "Abstract The differential diagnosis of optic neuropathy is broad. Ischemic vascular forms of optic neuropathy are more common in older patients. Pain generally accompanies the visual loss in cases of inflammatory optic neuritis. Compressive or infiltrative lesions that affect the optic nerve, such as optic glioma or optic nerve sheath meningioma, may present with painless unilateral visual loss. Neoplastic and non-neoplastic causes of compression of the intracranial optic nerve and optic chiasm frequently present with visual field defects. Slowly progressive, symmetric, central visual loss suggests a possible toxic or nutritional cause. Hereditary optic neuropathies generally are classified by their mode of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or mitochondrial (maternal) inheritance. Symptoms may be confined to the visual system or be accompanied by other neurologic or systemic signs and symptoms. Optic neuropathy can also be a manifestation of inherited metabolic and degenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Caracterització farmacològica de moduladors gabaèrgics per al tractament de l’insomni primari",
      "abstract": "L’insomni es un trastorn caracteritzat per la insatisfaccio en la qualitat i/o quantitat del son, que persisteix durant un considerable periode de temps. Es un son no reparador, amb consequencies diurnes com la fatiga, la irritabilitat o la disminucio de l’alerta, que afecta tant la vida social com laboral de l’individu. Dels diferents trastorns primaris del son, l’etiologia dels quals no es deguda a una malaltia mental, medica o a cap substancia, l’insomni primari te una prevalenca mitjana a la poblacio del 30%. Historicament el tractament farmacologic de l’insomni ha tingut com a principal diana el receptor GABA(A). L’evolucio dels hipnotics que actuen sobre aquest receptor, ha aportat una millora en la seva eficacia i seguretat. Tot i aixi, encara tenen efectes no desitjats com l’insomni de rebot, la dependencia, l’amnesia anterograda o la tolerancia. El nostre objectiu es trobar un candidat que millori els inconvenients dels hipnotics actuals. Seguint una estrategia de cribratge, seleccionar un compost amb: 1) major selectivitat in vitro per la subunitat ?1 del receptor GABA(A), implicada en el son, 2) activitat hipnotica in vivo que no alteri l’arquitectura del son i 3) una absorcio oral rapida i vida mitjana adequada. Dels 1214 compostos que es van cribrar en total, dos van presentar una elevada selectivitat in vitro per la subunitat alfa-1 del receptor GABA(A) major que la del zolpidem, el farmac de referencia mes selectiu que hi ha actualment al mercat. Aquesta selectivitat in vitro dels compostos, es correlaciona amb la selectivitat in vivo, de manera que els compostos mes selectius per la subunitat alfa-1 in vitro, son tambe els que indueixen sedacio in vivo sense efectes no desitjats com la relaxacio muscular associada a la subunitat alfa-2 del receptor GABA(A) Pero l’efecte in vivo no depen nomes de l’afinitat del compost pel receptor, sino tambe del nombre de receptors que el compost ocupa al teixit diana i de la seva eficacia intrinseca per activar-los i generar una resposta biologica. L’ocupacio de receptors s’ha analitzat en estudis ex-vivo i s’ha relacionat amb l’efecte observat en els assaigs de comportament in vivo. Quan es determina l’ocupacio ex-vivo del receptor GABA(A) per part dels compostos en determinades arees del cervell, on predomina una determinada subunitat del receptor, els compostos amb mes afinitat per la subunitat alfa-1 que indueixen sedacio a dosi mes baixa, tambe son els que per norma general requereixen menys dosi per assolir el 50% d’ocupacio ex-vivo dels receptors a cerebel (on predomina la subunitat alfa-1 implicada en sedacio). En el mateix sentit, els compostos menys afins per alfa-2 que requereixen una dosi mes alta per induir relaxacio muscular, son tambe els que per norma general assoleixen el 50% d’ocupacio ex-vivo a medul•la (on predomina la subunitat alfa-2) a una dosi mes gran. Les dades d’ocupacio ex-vivo a cerebel corroboren l’afinitat dels compostos in vitro per la subunitat alfa-1 del receptor GABA(A). En base als resultats presentats en la present Tesi Doctoral, es conclou que s’ha generat i seleccionat un candidat que podria millorar els inconvenients dels hipnotics actuals en els estudis preclinics.",

These impairments of time perception are more important in the psychopathological field. Except during organic brain disease disturbances of time experience are observed especially during endogenous psychoses. Depressed men usually feel an unpleasant extension of subjective time experience. In schizophrenia there is a specific distorsion of time, characterized by troubles of the biographic orientation, by magic connexion-thinking with regard to time, or by a \"collapse\" of the chronological order. Somatic as well as psychological conditions seem to cause these disturbances.",

This common operation involves many cognitive processes from the more elementary levels (touch, pressure, proprioception, etc.) to higher levels, allowing us to build up a complete object image. The complexity of the somatosensory neural system justifies the large variability of symptoms presented by subjects suffering from tactile recognition disorders. At the clinical level, it is possible to distinguish between low, elementary defects such as hemianaesthesia, which is typically related to a lesion in the contralateral somatosensory cortex, and higher, more \"cognitive\" disorders such as tactile agnosia, that is, a deficit in recognizing the meaning of a tactually explored object.",

Based on the discrepancy, the somatic symptoms with medically unexplained origins maintains, prolonged chronically, and grow up to FSS owing to various factors; physiological pathways, mood disturbance such as anxiety or depression, doctor-patient relationship, psychosocial stresses, alexithymia and alexisomia, and lack of support systems. As the pathology becomes more and more complicated, the psychosocial stresses, mood disturbance, and physiological dysfunction become more significant. Thus, the pathology falls into a vicious circle. Patients with FSS have common problems or characteristics, and have several overlapped diagnoses. FSS should be treated from aspects of both the similarity and the difference.",

In the latter case, the symptoms may be genuine side effects of drugs (hypotension, pathologic gambling, etc.) or they may be secondary either to the pathoplastic effect they have on the natural course of the disease (nonmotor fluctuations) or to the lack of dopamine (apathy, depression, dopamine withdrawal syndrome, etc.). In all these cases, dopaminergic treatment can be helpful. However, many other nonmotor (and motor) symptoms will have no correlation with dopamine; therefore, they require different treatments, very often with little efficacy, as in apathy or cognitive decline.",

Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations. Indeed, it is possible to argue that a cognitive impairment is the primary presenting feature of pathological anxiety, with the characteristic syndrome of somatic symptoms as secondary or necessary consequences of such cognitive disorder.",

      "abstract": "Stress is a continually growing concern in our society. The impact of stress on mental health and physical illness can be significant and a major factor in healthcare costs in the United States. A large percentage of Americans report feeling moderate-to-high stress levels on a daily basis [1]. When stress extends to include family and social aspects of one's life, complexities can exist beyond just individual coping of a situation or event. Stress has been seen by both patients and physicians as influencing health outcomes. However, stress is often difficult to define and study, in relation to both physical symptoms and external causes [2]. Family stress can be viewed as a disturbance in the ongoing state of a family system. This disturbance can occur both outside of the system (e.g., war, unemployment, natural disaster) and inside the family system (e.g., death, divorce, chronic illness). This systemic stress creates a change in the family's routine functioning [3]. Normative stressors (e.g., birth of a child, job transition, loss of an older adult) in families are considered to be common and predictable sources of stress. Nonnormative family stressors (e.g., early widowhood, job loss, natural disaster) are uncommon and unexpected and may occur at times other than those expected in the life cycle of the family or its members [4, 5]. How well the family unit copes with these two types of stressors largely impacts both the short-term and long-term adjustments and well-being of both the unit and the individuals in it.",

Despite extensive study, however, the extent, nature and underlying mechanisms of depression's influence on cognition remain relatively poorly understood. If one views the effects of depression on cognition as falling on a continuum, it is generally evident that individuals with dysthymia or only mild-to-moderate depressive symptomatology, despite their subjective complaints of memory impairment, demonstrate little, if any, objectively verifiable cognitive impairment. At the other extreme of the continuum, major depression can lead to such pervasive cognitive dysfunction, accompanied by impairments in occupational and social functioning, that an individual is diagnosed as having a dementia syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neglect is the failure to report, respond, or orient to novel or meaningful stimuli presented to the side opposite a brain lesion, when this failure cannot be attributed to either sensory or motor defects (Heilman, 1979). Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness). The first section of this chapter will define specific disorders and describe clinical tests that may be used to assess them.",

      "abstract": "A learning disability (LD) is a neurobiological disorder that presents as a serious difficulty with reading, arithmetic, and/or written expression that is unexpected, given the individual's intellectual ability. A learning disability is not an emotional disorder nor is it caused by an emotional disorder. If inadequately or improperly evaluated, a learning disability has the potential to impact an individual's functioning adversely and produce functional impairment in multiple life domains. When a learning disability is suspected, an evaluation of neuropsychological abilities is necessary to determine the source of the difficulty as well as the areas of neurocognitive strength that can serve as a foundation for compensatory strategies and treatment options.",

      "abstract": "The progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) are a devastating group of rare disorders(1) that manifest with increasing action myoclonus, which is also present at rest but activates with stimuli such as noise, light, or touch. Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

      "title": "Prolonged coma after anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Anesthesiologists are pretty much the only doctors who induce controlled and reversible coma medically in their daily practice. The word “coma” derived from a Greek word “Koma” signifies a state of sleep. In medical terms it is defined as a state of unresponsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused.[1] Therefore any delayed recovery is viewed as anesthetic problem. Delayed recovery from anesthesia or coma after anesthesia is a major anesthetic complication. The causes for delayed recovery from anesthesia are many. They are patient, surgical, anesthetic, and pharmacological factors. The pharmacological factors include the use of various anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and their interactions with other drugs, known or unknown. This depends upon the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, context sensitive half-lives, amount of drug administered, accidental administration, co-administration with other drugs etc. The patient factors such as the extremes of age, obesity, and various co-morbidities like the cardiovascular, renal, liver or other major organ dysfunction can potentiate the effects of the drug used. Some of the rare causes are myxoedema coma, drug toxicity and Addison's disease. However the delayed recovery due to anesthetic causes, excluding hypoxia, usually lasts for a few hours to days.[1] In the case report published in this issue, the coma lasted for >4 weeks. The authors have eliminated most of the causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia. However the hypoglycemia was detected in the postoperative period when the patient did not recover from anesthesia. The history obtained later revealed that the patient had taken long acting insulin in the preoperative period. The blood sugar level on the morning of surgery was borderline. No blood sugar was estimated during the entire surgical procedure. These factors could have led to profound and prolonged undetected hypoglycemia, which could have led to delayed recovery. Hypoglycemia of prolonged duration (>30 min) leads to neuroglycopenia and brain damage.[2] The symptoms depend on level of blood glucose and also on time taken to detect and correct hypoglycemia. Even after correcting hypoglycemia, prolonged coma is observed in critical care units. It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects, but the principal problem arising from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain is impairment of function (neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from mild dysphoria to more serious issues such as seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage and death.[3] Plasma glucose levels are maintained between 4 and 8 mmol/L (72–144 mg/dl) throughout the 24 hours. 3.3-3.9 mmol/L (60-70 mg/dl) is cited as lower limit of blood glucose. However hypoglycemic symptoms do not occur till 2.8-3.0 mmol/L (50-54 mg/dl) of plasma glucose. Under anesthesia hypoglycemic symptoms are not detected. In the case presented the blood glucose level 5 h after preoperative value was 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dl). To detect hypoglycemia causing brain damage electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion-weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful, both in detection and prognostication. EEG shows theta waves and lambda waves with definite slowing, flat and burst suppression patterns. In this case the EEG changes observed point to hypoglycemia as the factor leading to delayed recovery. There have been reports of hyper-intense signal intensities in diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in hypoglycemia.[4] Recently different patterns of DW MRI findings involving the internal capsules, corona radiata and frontoparietal cortex in a patient who recovered from prolonged hypoglycemic coma without neurological deficit have been observed. Therefore, this particular modality might have been useful in diagnosis and prognostication.[5] Volatile anesthetics have been found to produce neuroprotection in various paradigms. The preconditioning by these agents partially protects perirhinal cortex and striatal dependent functions against moderate to severe neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.[6] Although previous morphological data have suggested that cells die by necrosis, experimental research showed neuronal damage after hypoglycemia has features of apoptosis.[7] After exclusion of organic and pharmacological causes, coma may be attributed to a dissociative stupor. Reported delays in return to consciousness span time periods from 2 to 30 h, and longer periods of amnesia thereafter. There are four reports in the literature; each excluded other pathology with extensive examination, laboratory tests and radiological imaging. One individual experienced this phenomenon on three separate occasions after tracheal stenosis repairs.[89] Conclusion Delayed recovery is usually multifactorial. In the present case report, it looks more like prolonged hypoglycemia leading to delayed recovery. A differential diagnosis of dissociative stupor can be considered when other causes are excluded. The lesson one has to learn as a perioperative physician is to assess the patient thoroughly and investigate according to the need and evidence. An arterial blood gas and blood sugar estimation are needed in prolonged surgeries with multiple co-morbidities particularly in obese individuals.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a common comorbidity. Low academic performance must not be attributable to a more general condition such as intellectual disability, lack of educational opportunity, or low language proficiency. The learning difficulties are present from the early school years. The diagnostic assessment includes standardized academic achievement testing, review of academic records, and cognitive testing to rule out intellectual disability. Treatment includes specialized multimodal educational interventions in conjunction with academic accommodations. Pharmacologic treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders may provide indirect benefit by helping the child better access educational interventions.",

Insomnia can be the presenting symptom for several common sleep disorders, but it also often occurs comorbidly with mental and physical health conditions. Evaluating the symptom of insomnia requires assessing-largely by history-whether an underlying condition explains it. Insomnia disorder is the diagnostic term for the symptom of insomnia that merits specific attention. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is the preferred treatment approach because of its efficacy, safety, and durability of benefit, but pharmaceutical treatments are widely used for insomnia symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is seen by the insurance industry and many health care providers as an \"event.\" Once treated and provided with a brief period of rehabilitation, the perception exists that patients with a TBI require little further treatment and face no lasting effects on the central nervous system or other organ systems. In fact, TBI is a chronic disease process, one that fits the World Health Organization definition as having one or more of the following characteristics: it is permanent, caused by non-reversible pathological alterations, requires special training of the patient for rehabilitation, and/or may require a long period of observation, supervision, or care. TBI increases long-term mortality and reduces life expectancy. It is associated with increased incidences of seizures, sleep disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, neuroendocrine dysregulation, and psychiatric diseases, as well as non-neurological disorders such as sexual dysfunction, bladder and bowel incontinence, and systemic metabolic dysregulation that may arise and/or persist for months to years post-injury. The purpose of this article is to encourage the classification of TBI as the beginning of an ongoing, perhaps lifelong process, that impacts multiple organ systems and may be disease causative and accelerative. Our intent is not to discourage patients with TBI or their families and caregivers, but rather to emphasize that TBI should be managed as a chronic disease and defined as such by health care and insurance providers. Furthermore, if the chronic nature of TBI is recognized by government and private funding agencies, research can be directed at discovering therapies that may interrupt the disease processes months or even years after the initiating event.",

      "abstract": "Delirium oppstår oftest etter kirurgi og under intensivbehandling, og er en akutt forvirringstilstand på grunn av forstyrrelser i hjernens funksjoner. Patofysiologien er uklar, men delirium har en identifiserbar organisk årsak. Forløpet er fluktuerende og kan utvikle seg over tid. Symptomene kan være desorientering, hukommelsessvikt, hallusinasjoner og persepsjonsforstyrrelser (1). Pasientene blir svært sårbare fordi de har redusert evne til å ta del i, påvirke, eller kontrollere egen situasjon (2). Intensivmiljøet inneholder fysiske, psykiske og miljømessige faktorer som kan utløse et delirium, for eksempel respiratorbehandling, sedasjon, alvorlighetsgrad av kritisk sykdom, mangel på døgnrytme og farmakologisk påvirkning. Predisponerende faktorer som demens eller kognitiv dysfunksjon, depresjon, alvorlig sykdom eller komorbiditet er også tilstede hos pasienten før sykehusinnleggelse (3, 4). Det er rapportert om delirium hos nær 87% av alle respiratorbehandlede pasienter. Ubehandlet delirium kan påvirke pasientens kliniske tilstand, og føre til redusert kontinuitet i behandlingen, lengre behandlingstid, økte kostnader og i verste fall økt mortalitet (5). Pasientens adferd deles inn i hyperaktivt og hypoaktivt delirium, eller en kombinasjon av begge tilstandene. Hyperaktivt delirium er klassisk beskrevet som at pasienten er aggressive og utagerende, og ute av stand til å samarbeide. Hypoaktivt delirium viser seg ved svekket oppmerksomhet og bevissthet, og nedsatt psykomotorisk aktivitet. Det er høyest forekomst av pasienter i hypoaktivt delirium. På grunn av vage symptomer er det vanskeligere å avdekke. Dette fører til at langtidsprognosen for pasienter med hypoaktivt delirium er dårlig (5, 6). Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) er et validert kartleggingsverktøy som benyttes for å avdekke tilstanden hos intuberte pasienter som ikke kan kommunisere verbalt (4, 7, 8). Rutinemessig screening med et slikt kartleggingsverktøy for å avdekke delirium er anbefalt. Likevel viser forskning at tilstanden er underdiagnostisert (9, 10).",

Chronic dystonia can occur either locally (eg, writer's cramp, blepharospasm) or systemically as part of CP or other neurological syndromes.\n\nThe management of spasticity and chronic dystonia in children requires multidisciplinary management including neurologists, paediatricians, surgeons, GPs, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and pharmacists. Pharmacotherapy forms one aspect of this management and will be the focus of this review article, but other interventions, such as physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery and procedures, such as selective dorsal rhizotomy, play a major role too. Fundamental knowledge of pharmacologic properties and toxicities of these medications is required for safe and appropriate use, and should be part of an integrated therapeutic approach in which patients, carers, therapists, physicians and surgeons have open and clear communication about the overall rehabilitation process of the patient.\n\n### Oral/enteral drugs\n\nOral, or enteral medication, can provide systemic treatment for the relief of generalised spasticity via different pharmacological mechanisms.

      "title": "Stress and insomnia – A vicious circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterised by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school and social settings. The common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood, irritability, general discomfort and cognitive difficulties. On the other hand, stress results from emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can make a person feel frustrated, angry or anxious. Stress is the body’s response to a challenge or demand, accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stress depends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual’s characteristics, their neuroendocrine system and the combination of these elements, collectively determining how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include cognitive behavioural therapy, improving sleep hygiene and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than address its underlying cause. In the context of homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual’s unique structure, composition, nature and physical makeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualise each case and administer a simillimum remedy, the remedy most likely to restore health, and achieve complete healing according to homoeopathic principles. This review explores the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur due to the interplay between stress and the development of insomnia.",

Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses).

Symptoms of fibromyalgia may not only include pain, but also sleep disorder, fatigue, melancholia, and other mood disorders. Pain is one of the major symptoms of many diseases and may greatly impede the quality and functionof an individual's life. Yet many clinicians have trouble treating chronic pain in part because they focus on the pain itself, which is merely one of the causes, and not on the evaluation and treatment of problems incidental to pain. It is noted that pain may be accompanied by not only physical suffering, but also emotional problems, such as melancholia and other secondary problems. The causes for fibromyalgia syndrome have not yet been clearly revealed but it is known that mental factors contribute to the occurrence and progress of the symptoms, and that the evaluation of or therapeutic interventions for the mental causes may be due to physical effects. Therefore, based on ad-equate psychiatric knowledge, clinicians should under-stand and treat the patients accordingly. It may be that more effective medical services are needed through in-tensive treatments in multidisciplinary teams for the patients. This article is aimed at investigating the psychological issues that fibromyalgia patients encounter. It also considers the psychiatric drugs and psychosocial treatment that are applied to the disease.",

It is the most frequent reason for referring children to mental health services. Core symptoms of AD/HD (inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) present behaviors that parents may rate in standardized questionnaires (e.g., does not study, memory problems, cannot concentrate, cannot stay still, has no motives, etc.), are also present in other developmental or psychiatric disorders (e.g., specific learning difficulties, sensory modulation disorder, mood or anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders). This may cause errors in the differential diagnosis if clinicians do not add objective measures of cognitive deficits associated with each disorder. AD/HD presents neuropsychological deficits (compared to non-clinical populations) that are also present in other disorders, like deficient working memory, whereas other neuropsychological deficits are unique characteristics of AD/HD, such as sustained attention, response inhibition, and variability of response time. Likewise, anxiety disorders present neuropsychological deficits in autobiographical memory, mood disorders present neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and verbal memory. Neuropsychological tests such as the Continuous Performance Test, tests of reading phonetic decoding, and others, may improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis, differentiating AD/HD from other disorders, or revealing the comorbidity of AD/HD with other disorders.",

      "title": "Antihypertensive treatment and cognitive function: another tempest in a P pot?",
      "abstract": "Dementia is a major public health concern, due to its growing prevalence in the aging population, and hypertension is recognized as a risk factor for both of the most common forms of dementia, vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease. Vascular dementia results from ischemic, hypoperfusive, or hemorrhagic brain lesions and is characterized by damage of attentive and executive function and by noncognitive features such as depression, apathy and psychosis [1]. Alzheimer-type dementia is characterized by severe memory deficit, and its clinical expression is influenced by vascular damage in the brain, even if its pathogenesis involves primarily neurodegenerative processes [2]. Hypertension accelerates the cognitive decline through the vascular consequences of the blood pressure load, including accelerated atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, microangiopathy, and chronic subclinical ischemia of the cerebral white matter (clinically measurable as white matter alterations on neuroimaging). These processes cause basal ganglia dysfunction and cortical deafferentation. The vascular alterations also disrupt cerebral blood flow autoregulation and make the brain more susceptible to hypoperfusion during occasional hypotension that may be caused by inappropriate antihypertensive therapy. The effect of antihypertensive therapy in preventing or slowing down cognitive dysfunction has been investigated in several studies, but the results have been inconsistent [3]. The reasons of the inconsistency include the use of diagnostic tests, which are not sufficiently sensitive and specific to detect a slowly progressing clinical condition, such as the cognitive decline, in a relatively short time span, the heterogeneous impact of antihypertensive drugs on the brain and its vasculature, and the failure to recognize the impact of hypertension-induced brain damage on different cognitive domains due to the use of global cognitive function tests (as suggested by Birns et al.[4] in this journal). Another possible explanation is the nonlinear relationship of hypertension with cognitive decline [5]. Present evidence shows that hypertension in midlife, especially if not well treated, negatively affects cognition and contributes to the development of dementia later in life [6]. However, low blood pressure in the elderly is also associated with high prevalence of dementia. Some studies suggest a J-shaped or U-shaped relationship of blood pressure and cognitive performance in the elderly [5]. Therefore, still much is needed to clarify the role of antihypertensive therapy as such, and individual antihypertensive drugs, in the course of brain aging. In this issue of the journal, Hanon et al.[7] describe the effect of eprosartan-based therapy on blood pressure and cognition in a large group of hypertensive patients (>25000) older than 50 years (mean 64). Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini Mental State examination (MMSE) at baseline and after 6-month treatment. They show that eprosartan therapy is associated with a slight (less than one) but significant (P < 0.0001) improvement in the MMSE score. The extent of improvement is related with the magnitude of blood pressure lowering and is larger in the elderly. The strength of this study is in the large number of patients, as studies addressing cognitive function during the course of antihypertensive therapy in a large population are few. However, we are left with more questions than answers. The main questions are as follows: Is such a small change in MMSE score clinically significant? Is the change in the MMSE score due to blood pressure reduction or eprosartan-based therapy? The average MMSE score changed from 27.1 to 27.9 after follow-up, a statistically significant but small increase that is unlikely to have any clinical meaning. The increase in MMSE score was greater than two points in 22% of the patients. These patients were those with the worst baseline cognitive performance, and the largest on treatment blood pressure reduction, and were taking the largest number of antihypertensive drugs. The large study population provides strong support to the findings, but it has to be noted that, as the small change in global cognitive function was detectable after only 6-month treatment, it could be accounted for by regression toward the mean or getting used to MMSE and not to antihypertensive treatment. The lack of a control group makes it impossible to resolve the doubt. Therefore, we should regard these results only as an evidence of protective effect of therapy on cognitive decline rather than true improvement. We regret that MMSE was the only cognitive test, which is reasonable in a population setting but precludes any conclusion on the effects of blood pressure lowering on different cognitive domains. As for the second question, whether the effects on MMSE are specifically due to eprosartan or the blood pressure lowering per se, the observation that the greatest cognitive benefit was correlated with the baseline performance and the extent of blood pressure lowering, which was larger in the elderly who, presumably, were treated with the greatest number of antihypertensive drugs, casts doubts on the drug specificity of the effect. Again, it has to be noted that, as the elderly are susceptible to the adverse cerebral effects of blood pressure lowering due to microangiopathy and impairment of cerebral blood flow autoregulation, these findings clearly demonstrate the safety of antihypertensive treatment on cognitive function. In conclusion, an early reversal of some aspects of cerebral vascular remodeling by angiotensin receptor blockade can be foreseen from the results of Hanon et al.[7], but further investigations and a more comprehensive approach is needed to study the impact of blood pressure and antihypertensive drugs on brain anatomy and function [8]. By now, we are stuck to a P, which is conventionally significant but of little clinical significance after a 6-month follow-up. The evidence that a long-lasting treatment makes it significant also on clinical grounds is still awaited.",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)).

In volunteer subjects, they have been known to produce a variety of intense and unusual psychic effects. These include bizarre visual phenomena, ranging from a heightening of the apparent brightness or beauty of colored objects in the environment, through distortions in the perceived nature or meaning of real objects (illusions) to true visual hallucinations of colors, shapes, or even of complex scenes or events. These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions. Subjects describe changes in body image, the body or its parts appearing larger or smaller, intense feelings of depersonalization, including states in which the subject believes he is",

During mood swings, there may be features of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) that are mood-congruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

Memory impairment after stroke results from the cumulative effects of stroke and preclinical Alzheimer's disease or to unrecognized preexisting dementia. Mild memory complaints are frequent in stroke survivors. Confusion and memory loss can also result from infarction of the inferior genu of the internal capsule. This syndrome features fluctuating alertness, inattention, memory loss, apathy, abulia, psychomotor retardation, and severe memory loss. Concerning the influence of treatment modalities on memory defects, there are no differences between early and late aneurysmal surgery.

The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To describe the concept of memory impairment in schizophrenia and the clinical implications of this concept in terms of patient assessment and neuroleptic drug use. Method: Narrative literature review. Results: Individuals suffering from schizophrenia normally exhibit some degree of memory impairment. Recent work in psychopathology indicates that the impairment is comprehensive, involving the sensory, short-term, and long-term memory stores. Memory impairment appears to be a primary symptom of the disease, and its underlying causes are likely organic. A number of medications, however (for example, traditional neuroleptics and drugs that have pronounced anticholinergic activity), may cause or exacerbate impairment. In particular, anticholinergic agents used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms, a common complication of neuroleptic drugs, appear to have a deleterious effect on memory. Conclusions: Memory impairment is an important consideration in the clinical assessment and management of patients with schizophrenia. The use of atypical antipsychotics like risperidone appears to have no impact on memory function; because risperidone is associated with a low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects, it can obviate the need for anticholinergic medications—thus offering greater hope of nondebilitative intervention. The advent of medications that are safer (on cognition) could also lead to generally better outcomes by facilitating compliance with drug regimens and rehabilitation programs.",

One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "title": "Role of Sertraline in insomnia associated with post traumatic brain injury (TBI) depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability (1, 2). Sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, are very common following traumatic brain injury and have been reported in frequencies from 40% (3) to as high as 84% (4). Sleep disruption can be related to the TBI itself but may also be secondary to neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression) or neuromuscular (e.g., pain) conditions associated with TBI or to the pharmacological management of the injury and its consequences. Post-TBI insomnia has been associated with numerous negative outcomes including daytime fatigue, tiredness, difficulty functioning: impaired performance at work, memory problems, mood problems, greater functional disability, reduced participation in activities of daily living, less social and recreational activity, less employment potential, increased caregiver burden, greater sexual dysfunction, and also lower ratings of health, poor subjective wellbeing. These negative consequences can hamper the person’s reintegration into the community, adjustment after injury, and overall QOL. (5) The connection between depression and insomnia has not been investigated within the post TBI population to a great extent. For the general population, clinically significant insomnia is often associated with the presence of an emotional disorder (6). Fichtenberg et al. (2002) (7), in his study established that the strongest relationship with the diagnosis of insomnia belonged to depression. Given the high prevalence of depression during the first 2 years following TBI (8), a link between depression and insomnia among TBI patients makes innate sense. The present study aims at assessing role of sertralline in post TBI insomnia associated with depression.",

      "abstract": "The onset of disorders such as stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often sudden but is frequently followed by persistent and disabling long-term neuropsychiatric consequences. Few posttraumatic neuropsychiatric symptoms and syndromes are more disruptive to interpersonal familial, societal, educational, and occupational functioning and activities than agitation, aggression, and violent behaviors. Agitation and irritability that occur in a patient during the acute stages of recovery from TBI not only endanger the safety of the patient and his or her caregivers but also predict increased lengths of hospital stay and impaired cognition (Bogner et al. 2001). As recovery continues, low frustration tolerance and explosive behavior may develop in response to minimal provocation or sometimes may occur without any warning at all. These behaviors may be limited to irritability or may include violent outbursts resulting in damage to property or assaults on others. In severe cases, it may be unsafe for individuals with aggressive disorders to remain in the community or with their families, and referral to long-term psychiatric or neurobehavioral facilities is sometimes required. All clinicians, and especially mental health professionals, need to be knowledgeable about and able to evaluate and treat neurologically induced agitation, irritability, aggression, and violence among their patients with TBI.",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Following Intraoperative Awareness",
      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

It is consistently agreed that cognitive impairment is an important risk factor for developing functional disabilities in patients with dementia. Functional status can be conceptualized as the ability to perform self-care, self- maintenance and physical activity. A person with dementia usually requires help with more complex tasks, such as managing bills and finances, or simply maintaining a household. Good functional performance is fundamental for elderly people to maintain independency and avoid institutionalization. The purpose of this review is to describe functional changes in demented patients, evaluating the variability in subgroups of dementias.Demência é caracterizada por declínio na memória, linguagem, resolução de problemas e de outros domínios cognitivos que afetam a capacidade de realização de atividades cotidianas e atividades sociais. É consensual que o comprometimento cognitivo é um importante fator de risco para o desenvolvimento de incapacidades funcionais em pacientes com demência. O status funcional pode ser conceituado como a capacidade de realizar autocuidado, automanutenção e atividade física. Uma pessoa com demência geralmente requer ajuda para tarefas mais complexas, como gerenciar contas e finanças, ou simplesmente realizar atividades domésticas. Um bom desempenho funcional é fundamental para que os idosos mantenham a independência e evitem a institucionalização. O objetivo desta revisão é delinear alterações funcionais em pacientes com demência, valorizando os subgrupos variados de demências.",

An important clinical consideration for IEED is that of distinguishing mood from affect. IEED describes a syndrome of relatively stereotypical episodes of uncontrollable crying and/or laughing, resulting from lesions of multiple types, in multiple brain regions, without an apparent stimulus to trigger such responses. This syndrome is common among a number of neurological diseases like patients with a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as dementias such as Alzheimer;s disease (AD), and motor disorders such as Parkinson;s disease (PD). The neuropathological cause and neurochemistry of the disorder remains unclear. There is general agreement that IEED is the result of an injury to the neurological pathways that control the expression of emotions. Adequate treatment can reduce the frequency and improve the quality of life of patients and caregivers.",

Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime \"profile\" and \"signature\" is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, \"kindling,\" which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with \"criminal acts\" is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

They are the most common cause of orofacial pain of non-dental origin, their etiology is multifactorial and they have been associated to diverse factors such as depression, stress, anxiety and trauma. Trauma, from a psychological perspective, is a perceptual and direct experience that develops in relation to one of the following events: experience or witnessed threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to the physical integrity or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other significant person. This article explores the relationship within temporomandibular disorders, traumatic experiences and their psychopathophysiological impact.",

      "title": "The nature of neuroendocrine abnormalities in depression: a controversial issue in contemporary psychiatry.",
      "abstract": "Neuroendocrine abnormalities in depression have been regarded, by many authors, as relatively specific markers of nosological subtypes of the disorder, e.g. primary vs. secondary, endogenous vs. non-endogenous or unipolar vs. bipolar depression. They should reflect the same changes in central neurotransmitters (e.g. noradrenergic insufficiency and/or cholinergic hyperactivity) that were hypothesized as the cause of clinical symptoms. This view is challenged on the basis of our own neuroendocrine investigations in 317 psychiatric patients and 103 normal controls. According to these studies the abnormalities are nosologically rather unspecific. They are induced by a large variety of factors, e.g. emotional stress associated with the clinical symptomatology, weight loss due to malnutrition as a consequence of reduced appetite, medication and drug withdrawal. Stress-induced hypercortisolism appears to be the most common abnormality that may trigger other neuroendocrine dysfunctions, such as a blunted TSH response to TRH. Differences in neuroendocrine abnormalities of depressives are probably due to variations in the manifold factors influencing the hormonal axes involved, to temporal changes in hormonal patterns (e.g. one abnormality triggering another) and to individual differences in the basic activity and the responsiveness of the various axes.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

      "abstract": "Episodic-autobiographical memory (EAM) is the highest ontogenetic human achievement and is defined as the conjunction of subjective time, autonoetic consciousness and the experiencing self. The EAM system is more susceptible to insults than other memory systems and is predominantly affected in amnesic disorders. Dissociative amnesia is triggered by psychological stress and usually presents with retrograde memory impairment in the EAM domain. This work's objectives are establishing greater recognition of the changes in the area of personality dimensions, self and autonoetic consciousness, accompanying dissociative amnesia. We review data from own patients with dissociative amnesia or fugue Patients were investigated medically, neuropsychologically and neuroradiologically. We found impairments of self and self-referential processing in patients with dissociative amnesia, such as profound loss of personal identity, decreased ability for self-reflection and self projection and anomalous self-face processing. We also identified changes in personality dimensions involving affectivity, perception, cognition (e.g. social cognition) and behavior. The observed changes in self and autonoetic consciousness may represent a consequence of amnesia. Studies indicate a right hemispheric bias for higher forms of self awareness. In retrograde dissociative amnesia, we found a hypometabolism in right fronto-temporal areas, suggesting a defective synchronization during retrieval between processing of affectively-loaded personal events and fact-based processing. This synchronization abnormality in our opinion not only leads to a memory blockade, but also to a shrinkage of self and loss of autonoetic consciousness in dissociative amnesic conditions.",

      "abstract": "As it is well known, all living humans are subject to daily effects of stress; the stress response varies among individuals depending on the experience that has endowed each person to learn how to deal with stress. Stress relief may be obtained by procedures that lead the subject to “forget” the bad situation or to relax, for instance physical exercise, talking the problem to someone else, drinking alcoholic beverages or using drugs of abuse. Drug addiction develops in persons voluntarily seeking relief from a depressive situation, usually linked to personal catastrophic event, death of a dear family member or a valuable loss of personal belonging, or else also voluntarily aiming to a novel mood enhancing experience, in spite of being conscious of the unwanted effects – dependence – arising from repetitive drug taking, the most serious being addiction, a persistent state in which compulsive drug use escapes control. Addictive drugs besides providing a pleasant rewarding experience also generate reinforcing behaviors of the drug effects leading to tolerance, dependency compulsion, persistence, chronicity with multiple relapses and withdrawal syndrome. The compulsion and persistence are based on pathological molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in memory. Studies done both in humans and rodent models of addiction indicate that key behavior abnormalities associated with addiction are related to changes in the brain, both at molecular and cellular levels. The plastic changes in the dopaminergic VTA NAc pathway and the interconnected structures, also include changes in the gene transcription, RNA and protein processing and in synaptic structure. All the specific changes so far identified are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the behaviors associated with addiction.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a symptom complex that may include hallucinations, delusions, disorders of thought, and disorganized speech or behavior. Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive system is structured from sets of schema, patterns of neural activity that allow the assimilation or accommodation of new experiences and so, by a process of consolidation, the gradual development of knowledge and understanding. As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

Unipolar depression is commonly (about 75% of cases) non-familial, clearly associated with stressful life-events and accompanied by symptoms of anxiety and agitation; this type is sometimes termed reactive depression. Other patients (about 25%, sometimes termed endogenous depression) show a familial pattern, unrelated to external stresses, and with a somewhat different symptomatology.

Coma is a medical emergency, because a comatose patient is at high risk of permanent brain injury or death, caused either by the underlying disorder or the secondary effects of coma. Stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation, and exclusion of hypoglycaemia are the first priorities, before diagnosis is explored further.

Then, you experience violent muscle contractions in which the muscles move in quick, random spasms. You lose consciousness, or black out, so that you are no longer aware of what’s happen ing.",

Die wichtigste Differenzialdiagnose ist die Schizophrenie, aber auch das Alkoholdelir sowie drogeninduzierte Psychosen. Die Prognose ist in den meisten Fällen gut, zur Akuttherapie werden Neuroleptika eingesetzt. Selten sind paranoide Störungen, speziell der alkoholische Eifersuchtswahn, der manchmal als Residuum einer chronischen Alkoholhalluzinose persistiert und monosymptomatisch bleibt. Gefürchtet sind die resultierenden Gewaltdelikte. Die Therapie ist meist schwierig, Neuroleptika nur begrenzt wirksam.",

A detailed knowledge of such symptoms and their possible causes is invaluable to confidently approach the problem in a systematic manner. Evaluation should begin with careful history taking and physical examination for intercurrent illness and a baseline set of tests. Investigation usually includes computed tomography of the brain and often magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and/or electroencephalography as well.

Anksioznost kao psihicki poremecaj ukljucuje i specificne simptome koji dovode do neurobioloske disfunkcije, te zahtijevaju posebne terapijske procedure, a smanjuju socijalnu i radnu sposobnost. Simptomi karakteristicni za anksioznost dijele se na psiholoske i tjelesne simptome. Psiholoski simptomi su: pretjerana plasljivost i strahovanje, osjecaj unutarnje napetosti i nemira, smetnje koncentacije, pojacana osjetljivost na buku, smetnje spavanja, smetnje u pamcenju. Tjelesni se simptomi mogu ocitovati na gotovo svim organskim sustavima. Karakteristicni su : kardiovaskularni, respiratorni, gastrointestinalni, genito-urinarni, neuroloski. Anksiozni poremecaji praceni su visokom stopom suicidalnosti, a predisponiraju i za razvoj raznovrsnih psihosomatskih bolesti.\r\n Psiholoske teorije anksioznost objasnjavaju kao premjestanje intrapsihickog konflikta (psihodinamski model), te kao fenomen uvjetovanja (kognitivno bihevioralni model).\r\n Psihodinamska teorija anksioznost objasnjava kao konflikt između ida i ega.\r\n Kognitivna teorija anksioznost objasnjava kao tendenciju prekomjerne procjene potencijala za opasnost.\r\n Dijagnoza se temelji na pažljivo prikupljenoj anamnezi, procjeni psihickog i somatskog statusa te ucinjenih somatskih pregleda i pretraga.\r\n Najcesci anksiozni poremecaji su:\r\n *generalizirani anksiozni poremecaj\r\n *panicni poremecaj\r\n *fobije\r\n *anksiozno depresivni poremecaj\r\n *opsesivno kompulzivni poremecaj\r\n *anksioznost u organskih bolesnika\r\n *posttraumatski stresni poremecaj\r\n Lijecenje se sastoji od kombinacije farmakoterapije i psihoterapije.\r\n Provodi se ambulantno i bolnicki.

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

Partial seizures are focal—they involve only circumscribed areas of the brain—and may occur in a fully conscious state (simple partial seizures or focal seizures without dyscognitive features) or may produce altered states of consciousness (complex partial seizures or focal seizures with dyscognitive features). Patients who have alterations of consciousness during a seizure (complex partial seizures) may be amnestic or partially amnestic for some of the seizure episode. Seizures may induce cardiac arrthymias. This may be a cause of death. Partial seizures often begin in childhood but may not be diagnosed until the individual is an adult.

Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

Grief is emotional, is often an unknown reaction, and it does not always make sense. As an individual experiences grief, dwelling on what has been lost is part of the normal process. The individual is faced with their loss on a daily basis and for some, moving through this process may be very difficult. This is an assessment conducted by a neuropsychologist or a trained skill psychometrist.

      "title": "STRESS COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION PREVENTS COCAINE RELAPSE BY DISRUPTING MEMORY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug addiction is a chronic and recurrent brain disease. Addictive substances can cause changes in brain circuits and may be integrated into the memory system. Drug addiction consists of different phases, beginning when recreational use escalates to compulsive use and then cycles through withdrawal, and relapse. A relapse is a return to drinking or drug use after attempts have previously been made to stop. The prevention of relapses is perhaps the most fundamental task in addiction recovery. Repeated retrieval by the cue without reward stimulant reduces the behavioral response through a process called extinction. This learning is the fundamental principle underlying many cognitive- behavioral psychotherapeutic treatments. Yet behavioral change may be difficult to sustain, and relapse is not uncommon, even after successful treatment. Memory updating was applied to substance use problems by weakening the ability of drug-associated triggers to elicit substance use[1]. Stress can potentially affect all cognitive phases involved in memory function such as the process of memory storage, retrieval or/and consolidation. Stress prior to extinction might not only enhance the consolidation of extinction memory, like post-extinction stress does, but also make it less context- dependent[2]. Aims &amp; Objectives 1) Whether stress combined with extinction learning disrupts consolidated memory to suppress cocaine relapse. 2) What is the mechanism of stress combined with extinction learning suppressing drug seeking behavior. Method The self-administration of cocaine was used as an animal model for addictive memory. A combination of techniques, including immunofluorescence, fiber optic recording, brain slice patch-clamp recordings, and Golgi staining, was employed to explore the mechanism of stress combined with extinction in addictive memory. Results (1) The drug-priming test following self-administration extinction training suggested that rats exposed to footshock before extinction training (FE group) had a lower number of active nosepokes compared to extinction group (E group). Interestingly, in conditioned place avoidance test, footshock did not elicit an aversive response. (2) Fiber optic recording results showed excitatory neuron in LHb were more active in FE group during drug-priming test. Electrophysiological in vitro results suggested a significant increase in action potential firing and reduction of the threshold of the injected current to trigger the action potential in LHb. (3) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb combined with extinction training effectively facilitated the elimination of cocaine addiction memory and reduced psychological craving. (4) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb increased cfos expression in RMTg. Activation of LHb-RMTg also facilitated extinction and inhibited relapse. Activation of LHb-RMTg circuit could mimic the effect of stress combined with extinction in inhibiting relapse. Discussion &amp; Conclusion This study demonstrateed that stress combination with extinction training may promote the extinction of addictive memory and inhibit relapse by reshaping activity of neurons in the LHb-RMTg circuit.

Understand the usual range of symptoms and associated behaviors that are seen after a person has a significant loss, including psychological symptoms, health behavior, and use of alcohol and medications. 2. Learn the course of “normal” symptoms of bereavement in the first year after the death of a loved one. 3. Distinguish between the similarities and differences in ‘normal’ bereavement symptoms and the syndrome of depression and its course, as compared to the symptoms and course of the psychiatric disorder, major depression. Bereavement is a universal human experience that most people endure with minimal morbidity. However, for some, losing a loved one can lead to the development of a psychiatric illness like chronic depression, the exacerbation of a substance use disorder or persistent complex bereavement disorder or to increased general medical morbidity or mortality. Thus, it is important to recognize the clinical features and time course of “normal” bereavement so that ordinary grief isn’t pathologized and to facilitate recognition of these important complications.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) accounts for approximately 80% of the estimated 373000 traumatic brain injuries that occur annually in the United States. MTBI typically occurs in males 15 to 24 years of age, and postconcussional sequelae may impede physical, emotional, social, marital, vocational, and avocational functioning. Usually the severity of the initial neurologic injury is defined according to the Glasgow Coma Score, the presence and duration of amnesia (retrograde and anterograde), and the alteration of loss of consciousness and its duration. MTBI is a traumatically induced physiological disruption of cerebral function manifested by at least one of the following: loss of consciousness no longer than 20 minutes; any loss of memory; any alteration in mental status at the time of the accident; physical symptoms that potentially are related to the brain; and development of posttraumatic cognitive deficits not accounted for by emotional factors. When a patient presents with multisystem trauma, impairments may involve several parts of the body, including the nervous system. Individual impairments of other systems should be calculated separately and their whole person values combined using the Combined Values Chart in AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment . At present, no ideal system can rate impairment following MTBI, and physicians must thoroughly understand both the underlying disease process and the associated injuries.",

      "title": "Assisting Veterans with mTBI/PTSD",
      "abstract": "Concussion, also called mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is a diffuse non-penetrating head injury caused by a sudden external force, such as during contact sports or a blast in combat.1 When a sudden force moves the brain rapidly inside the close confines of the skull, it creates chemical changes, inflammation, stretching and shearing of axons, improper cell function, and cell death. This injury is often not visible on medical imaging, but it disrupts micro-second temporal computations critical for signal decoding and speech processing. Common symptoms of concussion/mTBI include cognitive impairment, attention deficits, difficulty concentrating, headaches, visual problems, anxiety, depression, irritability, and sleep disturbances. Loss of consciousness is not required for the diagnosis of concussion. However, repeated concussive or sub-concussive events, especially with loss of consciousness, can result in greater severity of the symptoms.PTSD, mental health, hearing lossFigure 1: Audiograms of veterans with mTBI and/or PTSD.Table 1: Counseling Strategies for Veterans with mTBI and/or PTSDGenerally, the symptoms resolve within three months. Some individuals, however, may continue to experience symptoms for a year or more.2 About 50 percent of individuals with a single mTBI exposure demonstrate long-term cognitive impairment and other symptoms that can interfere with returning to work or school.3, 4 Concussions, especially from blast injuries, can also damage the auditory system. The human ear is designed to be sensitive to changes in pressure; therefore, it is the organ most susceptible to pressure changes created by a blast wave. Auditory symptoms reported with mTBI or concussion include difficulty understanding speech in quiet and in noise, difficulty attending to sounds or ignoring distracting sounds, tinnitus, hyperacusis, and balance problems.1 Events that cause mTBI may result in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a psychiatric disorder that can occur in people who have difficulty recovering from experiencing/witnessing a traumatic physical or emotional event. The persistent mental and emotional distress can last over a month.5 Individuals who experienced a traumatic event that did not trigger PTSD are at an increased risk for PTSD in the future.6 Many military veterans experience multiple episodes of mTBI, which set them at a higher risk for PTSD. Between 2000 and 2018, roughly 315,897 cases of mTBI, many of which caused by blast-related injury, were confirmed across all branches of the U.S. military.7 About 20 percent of U.S. military veterans are affected by PTSD.5 Veterans with combined mTBI and PTSD show exacerbated symptoms of decreased attention, working memory/memory deficits, executive function deficits, and hypervigilance.8 It is important to raise awareness of common behaviors and test discrepancies observed in veterans with mTBI and/or PTSD so hearing health professionals can better diagnose and counsel these patients. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Many veterans receive audiologic care outside of the Veteran's Administration Medical Center (VAMC). Our university clinic is under a contractual agreement with different veteran service groups to provide compensation and pension audiologic assessments. A subset of the veterans assessed in our clinic exhibited normal or mild pure-tone thresholds while self-reporting a much more significant hearing loss. These findings were consistent with a recent study that found that among 87 percent of veteran participants with mTBI who reported hearing loss, nearly two-thirds fell within the “normal hearing” range.9 Comorbid hyperacusis with mTBI and PTSD was common in our clinic population, which created practical problems during assessments. In some cases, when assessing acoustic reflex thresholds (ARTs), results were either inaccurate, or the test could not be completed when the louder reflex tones elicited significant physical discomfort and/or anxiety resulting in muscle tension. Clinicians need to be vigilant in recognizing these behaviors because veterans often do not disclose hyperacusis or report any discomfort. Conversely, some veterans appeared to tolerate the ART assessment, but demonstrated sound sensitivity during pure tone evaluation to levels below those used to assess ARTs. Other issues confounding diagnosis were incomplete or unavailable medical history at the time of the appointment and veterans not always reporting combat-related injuries, mTBI, and/or PTSD. CASE STUDIES These three cases exemplify the type of case histories, behaviors, and audiometric test results observed in the veteran population in our clinic. These three veteran patients men between 22 and 55 years old. Audiometric evaluations were performed according to the test procedures required by VAMC and using insert earphones in a sound booth. The veterans’ middle ear status was normal as determined via tympanometry and ARTs. Word recognition scores (WRS) were determined at 40 dB SL re: speech recognition threshold (SRT) in quiet. The Stenger test was performed as needed according to the VAMC protocol. Veteran A reported a history of blast exposure, multiple concussions (>6), with reported loss of consciousness on several occasions. He reported having hearing difficulty, needing closed captioning for TV, and requesting frequent repetitions from communication partners. Figure 1A shows veteran A's audiogram. His WRS were excellent at 92 percent for the right ear and 100 percent for the left. These results were not consistent with Veteran A's subjective hearing loss. He was previously diagnosed with PTSD. Veteran B reported a history of blast exposure and concussion. He reported having constant bilateral tinnitus, as well as difficulty communicating in noise and understanding his wife. He tolerated the ART assessment, but had anxiety and sensory overload during the hearing evaluation, which increased the test administration time. He needed the lights to be dimmed in the sound booth and test suite during the test. He also needed a water break to recuperate. Figure 1B shows his audiogram. The WRS were excellent at 92 percent for the right ear and 96 percent for the left, which were not consistent with Veteran B's subjective hearing loss. He denied having PTSD. Veteran C reported a history of blast injury and head injury from a service-related fall. He reported requiring multiple repetitions of verbal information and missing information because of an inability to notice that he was being spoken to. He demonstrated high anxiety levels during the hearing evaluation. He denied having hyperacusis repeatedly, but became increasingly anxious as the stimulus levels for the ART assessment increased to >90 dB HL. Contralateral acoustic reflex thresholds for the higher frequencies could not be determined because the test had to be discontinued due to patient discomfort. The WRS were good at 84 percent for the right ear and 80 percent for the left. Figure 1C shows Veteran C's audiogram. The WRS were lower than expected based on age and pure tone thresholds. The veteran believed that he had PTSD, but had yet to be diagnosed. COUNSELING VETERANS WITH MTBI/PTSD Simply validating perceptual hearing problems can be significant for some veterans. Emphasizing counseling during and after the audiometric evaluation can provide a gateway to a veteran's whole-person health care and encourage the patient to seek additional services for mTBI and/or PTSD. Unless clinicians ask the appropriate questions, it is easy to overlook mTBI/PTSD as an underlying cause of a veteran's problems. Useful counseling strategies are shown in Table 1. Audiologists need to be aware that the hearing complaints of veterans with mTBI or PTSD may actually be non-auditory behavioral, emotional, and cognitive/attention issues that can confound diagnosis and raise suspicion of non-compliant behaviors or non-organic hearing loss. Comprehensive assessment of the peripheral and central auditory and vestibular systems, including speech-in-noise testing, and tinnitus assessment may be necessary. Guiding veterans’ understanding that hearing goes beyond the peripheral auditory system is important to validating any perceived hearing problem. This will also help them be more responsive to counseling and other intervention services. Thoughts on something you read here? Write to us at [email protected]",

This exposes an inherent flaw in our nosological system, which requires a manic or hypomanic episode for diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Treatment of a depressive episode in undiagnosed bipolar disorder can entail the use of medications that were developed to treat a different disorder (major depressive illness) and that may have mood-destabilizing or activating properties.",

Myotonic dystrophy is characterized neither by intellect outside the range of normal (except in those infrequent cases of neonatal myotonic dystrophy) nor by intellectual deterioration. Apparent cognitive deficits more likely result from reversible neuroamine dysfunction associated with a biological depressive illness that may be an intrinsic part of the disorder of myotonic dystrophy. Much of the purported emotional problems, “personality disturbances and social deterioration”, represent symptomatology of this biological depressive illness. This depressive component seems to be responsive to tricyclic antidepressant treatment; such pharmacotherapy also provides additional benefit to other symptoms including gastrointestinal dysfunction, hypersomnia, myotonia, and muscular weakness. It seems probable that the basic genetic defect (possibly involving membrane structure) in myotonic dystrophy results in abnormal aminergic and peptidergic receptors and that dysfunction of the limbic system of the brain is only one of many disturbances caused by the receptor abnormalities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Illness behavior refers to the ways in which symptoms are perceived, understood, acted upon, and communicated and include facial grimacing, holding or supporting the affected body part, limping, using a cane, and stooping while walking. Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

Findings were inconsistent but suggest that physical symptoms are common after severe or recurrent traumatic stress and/or if there were physical sensations at the time of the stressor (for example, rape), irrespective of whether there was permanent tissue damage. Somatic symptoms after traumatic experiences may result from: a) tissue damage, including the brain; b) physioslogic hyperactivity; and/or c) somatization. Psychologic symptoms that am typical of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be masked by somatization. Somatization is more likely to occur when, as a result of younger age or cultural mores, there is an impaired capacity to communicate psychologic experiences. Prospective studies to investigate the relationship of trauma to somatic symptoms an needed.",

The depth of mental disorders is relatively low in neuroses - there are no deep disturbances of thinking, cognition and consciousness, and a critical attitude to others and one's own state is preserved.

La presencia conduce a deterioro fisico y cognitivo del paciente, en relacion al componete cognitivo los factores mas reportadas son deficits en funciones ejecutivas, atencion, velocidad de procesamiento, habilidades visoespaciales y memoria, pocos estudios han reportado las alteraciones que presentan los pacientes con EM en aspectos del lenguaje, especificamente en el componente pragmatico, referido como la comprension de aspectos del significado de enunciados emitidos de los cuales no se puede obtener informacion de la intencion del hablante por una referencia directa o el lenguaje literal. En la literatura ha sugerido que las fallas en el componente pragmatico subyacen a la interaccion de otros dominios cognitivos. Existen 2 modelos que intentan explicar esta hipotesis identificando por un lado a las Funciones Ejecutivas (FE) y por otro a las Habilidades Visoespaciales (HV) en otras poblaciones como demencia tipo Alzheimer, siendo estas funciones tipicamente alteradas en EM. El objetivo del trabajo es examinar el rol de los componentes cognitivos involucrados en el deficit del funcionamiento pragmatico de pacientes con EM. Se realizara un estudio transversal correlacional, participaran 30 pacientes con EM remitente recurrente, se evaluara su desempeno en tareas de FE, HV y pragmatica utilizando la Bateria Neuropsicologica de Screening en Esclerosis Multiple y el Protocolo para la Evaluacion de la Comunicacion de Montreal. Los resultados de las dos evaluaciones se correlacionaran con el objetivo de identificar la relacion entre FE, HV y el componente de pragmatica para determinar si las alteraciones presentadas por los pacientes podrian estar permeadas por la funcion de otros dominios cognitivos.",

One or the other is not enough. You need both. You do not need a scan or lab test to make the diagnosis. No scan or test can “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event.

Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is frequently associated with different medical disorders. This may be due to a variety of reasons: repercussions on sleep of the symptoms pertaining to these illnesses, e.g. pain, dyspnoea, nycturia, reduced motility, pruritus; anxiety or even depressive moods induced by the handicap, a failure to understand the course of illness, sometimes the risk to life itself; the adverse effects of certain medications used. This chapter will deal with the sleep disorders encountered in heart, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, renal, rheumatic, endocrine and metabolic conditions. For insomnias related to neurological diseases, the reader should refer to chapter 57 \"Sleep and lesions in the CNS\" and for insomnia within a framework of fibromyalgia, to chapter 60 \"Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of sleep disturbances\". As a general rule, the treatment of sleep disturbances associated with medical disorders comes under the treatment of the diseases themselves. Nevertheless it is important to take account of the associated psychological factors, such as anxiety brought on by the illness, stress provoked by a stay in hospital, the possible pain involved in explorations, a scheduled surgical operation, which quite naturally lead to proposing anxiolytic or hypnotic treatment. But there may be drawbacks to prescribing such treatment: it may have a detrimental effect on the immediate course of illness, as in the effect of benzodiazepines on respiratory failure, for example; a risk of tolerance or dependency due to the chronic nature of the underlying illness, not to mention a lack of understanding of the hypnotic effects or non-effects on the sleep of subjects affected by various types of illness.",

Dysarthria is a disorder that occurs as a result of a brain condition that often makes it very difficult to articulate sounds and pronounce words, leading to impairments in the intelligibility, audibility, naturalness and efficiency of vocal communication. There are many potential causes of dysarthria. These include toxic, metabolic, degenerative diseases, traumatic brain injury, or thrombotic or embolic stroke. Central or peripheral neurological lesions can lead to paralysis or a lack of coordination of the verbo-motor system, producing severe speech disorders, which in turn prevent control over the tongue, throat, lips or lungs; for example, swallowing (dysphagia) and mastication problems. Dysarthria is different from verbal apraxia, it does not include speech disorders generated by structural anomalies (malformations). The symptomatology is very diverse, depending on the intensity of the neuronal damage, which is correlated with the etiology, which includes toxic, metabolic, degenerative diseases, traumatic brain injuries or thrombotic or embolic stroke. From the perspective of the location of the lesion on the brain, the classification of dysarthria is presented, and the forms are described.",

      "abstract": "Die urämische Enzephalopathie (UE) ist ein hirnorganisches Psychosyndrom mit fokalen oder generalisierten neurologischen Ausfällen, das in der Regel bei Patienten mit akutem Nierenversagen stärker ausgeprägt und schneller progredient ist als bei Patienten mit chronischem Nierenversagen. Frühe Symptome sind Müdigkeit, Apathie, Ungeschicklichkeit sowie Konzentrationsstörungen, die sich bis hin zu einem deliranten Syndrom mit generalisierten Anfällen, Bewusstseinstrübung und Koma fortentwickeln können. Pathophysiologisch liegt der UE wahrscheinlich eine parathormonabhängige Beeinträchtigung synaptischer Funktionen im ZNS zugrunde. Bildgebende Verfahren dienen im Wesentlichen dem Ausschluss anderer neurologischer Erkrankungen, im EEG zeigen sich die unspezifischen Veränderungen einer metabolischen Enzephalopathie. Die Behandlung der UE besteht in einer Normalisierung der metabolischen Entgleisung, die in der Regel zu einer vollständigen Remission der neuropsychiatrischen Symptome führt. Bei effektiver Therapie (gegebenenfalls mit Dialyse) und schneller Restitution der Nierenfunktion sind residuelle neurologische Defizite ungewöhnlich. Bei permanentem Nierenversagen ist die Nierentransplantation Therapie der Wahl. Die urämische Neuropathie (UNP) ist eine distal betonte, axonale, sensible mehr als motorische Neuropathie mit brennenden Dysästhesien. Häufig sind Mononeuropathien, v. a. das Karpaltunnelsyndrom, als Folge einer vermehrten Anfälligkeit für Druckläsionen. Eine Beteiligung des autonomen Nervensystems in bis zu 50 % der Patienten ist beschrieben. Elektrophysiologisch findet sich eine Verlangsamung der Nervenleitgeschwindigkeiten und distalen motorischen Latenzen mit reduzierten Amplituden sowie im Verlauf Denervierungszeichen im Elektromyogramm als Kennzeichen einer vorwiegend axonalen Neuropathie. Die Therapie der UNP besteht in einer effektiven Dialyse. Leichte UNP können sich klinisch durchaus zurückbilden, wobei Veränderungen der neurophysiologischen Parameter in der Regel bestehen bleiben. Schwere UNP bilden sich klinisch trotz adäquater Dialysetherapie allenfalls leicht zurück. Die erfolgreiche Nierentransplantation führt zu einer Verbesserung bei praktisch allen Patienten mit UNP außer bei weit fortgeschrittenen Fällen. Wichtige dialyseassoziierte Komplikationen sind das Dialysedysäquilibriumsyndrom (DDS) und die Dialyseenzephalopathie (DE). Ersteres manifestiert sich mit Unruhe, Muskelkrämpfen, Übelkeit und migräneartigen Kopfschmerzen bedingt durch einen plötzlichen Abfall der Serumosmolalität unter Dialyse mit zytotoxischem Hirnödem. Letztere ist durch Aluminiumtoxizität verursacht und vor allem durch progressive Sprech- und Sprachstörungen, Depression, Myoklonien und Anfälle gekennzeichnet. Präterminal sind die Patienten immobil und mutistisch. Das DDS wird durch eine langsame Dialyse verhindert, die DE durch aluminiumfreie Diät und Dialyse sowie mit Chelatbildnern (Desferrioxamin) behandelt. Bis zu 70 % aller DE-Patienten verbessern sich darunter.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that continued excessive alcohol consumption can lead to the development of physiological dependence. When drinking is abruptly terminated or substantially reduced in the dependent individual, a characteristic withdrawal syndrome ensues. As with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of chronic alcohol use are opposite in nature to the effects of intoxication. Thus, clinical features of alcohol withdrawal include signs of heightened autonomic nervous system activation (e.g., tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, diaphoresis, tremor), CNS hyperexcitability that may culminate in motor seizures, and, in its most severe form, hallucinosis and delerium tremens (1–3). In addition to physical signs of withdrawal, a constellation of symptoms contributing to psychological discomfort (e.g., irritability, agitation, anxiety, dysphoria) constitute a significant component of the withdrawal syndrome (4–7). The overall intensity of the withdrawal syndrome is presumed to reflect the degree of physiological dependence developed during the course of chronic alcohol use/abuse.",

This chapter describes the mental phenomena prior to their becoming part of the formulation of particular disorders, but for convenience and coherence some common syndromes, such as mania, are used to draw together the associated phenomena. A hierarchy moving from feelings through emotions, moods, and affective state to temperament involves increasing complexity in terms of state of mind and usually to an increasing duration of that state. Delusion involves abnormal beliefs that arise in the context of disturbed judgements and an altered experience of reality. Depersonalisation and derealisation are assumed to arise from a disruption in the functions of consciousness to create amnesia, dissociative identity disorder and depersonalisation disorder. Speech disorder is usually separated from language and thought disorder.",

      "abstract": "A síndrome da fibromialgia (SFM) é uma condição de dor crônica, generalizada e de difícil tratamento, com importante prevalência na população geral. A fibromialgia é mais do que um estado de dor musculoesquelética crônica, porque a maioria desses pacientes também experimenta fadiga, distúrbios de sono, dor visceral, intolerância a exercícios e sintomas neurológicos. É uma síndrome caracterizada mais por sintomas, sofrimento e incapacidades do que por alterações orgânicas estruturais demonstráveis, podendo fazer parte do grupo de síndromes funcionais. Muitas tentativas para elucidar a patogenia orgânica da SFM, como pesquisas em genética, aminas biogênicas, neurotransmissores, hormônios do eixo hipotálamo-hipófise-adrenal, estresse oxidativo, mecanismos de modulação da dor, sensibilização central e função autonômica na SFM, revelam várias anormalidades, indicando que múltiplos fatores e mecanismos podem estar envolvidos na patogênese dessa síndrome. A disautonomia pode ter um importante papel na fisiopatologia da SFM, embora não esteja claro se é causa ou efeito ou um componente deste mosaico. Pesquisas futuras devem ser encorajadas no sentido de se avaliar o papel do sistema nervoso autônomo ou sua disfunção na complexa fisiopatologia da SFM e a eficácia de intervenções terapêuticas por meio de ensaios controlados e randomizados. O desenvolvimento de terapias efetivas para a fibromialgia tem sido retardado pela falta de entendimento dos mecanismos fundamentais da etiologia da síndrome. Uma boa compreensão dos mecanismos é a base para o desenvolvimento e a comprovação de condutas terapêuticas adequadas. Esta revisão descreve os mais recentes artigos da literatura que demonstram haver uma desregulação no sistema nervoso autônomo na SFM e discute a disautonomia como um potencial mecanismo participante na gênese e manutenção da sintomatologia e comorbidades da SFM.",

Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is the most severe of the generalized types and exhibits major neocortical migration defects, less severe and non-inflammatory white matter lesions, and dysmorphic features. In adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) the major lesion again is in the CNS, but consists of extensive dysmyelination/inflammatory demyelination without neuronal migration defects or dysmorphism. In adrenomyeloneuropathy long tract degeneration of spinal cord, peripheral neuropathy, and variable CNS dysmyelinative to inflammatory demyelinative lesions are the dominant nervous system lesions. Saturated very long chain fatty acids, either free in the cytoplasm of affected endocrine cells or as components of membrane lipids (e.g. gangliosides, glycerophospholipids, and proteolipid protein) in axons or myelin, may be central to the pathogenesis of these neuronal migration defects, dysmyelination/inflammatory demyelination and spinal tract degeneration. Cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and delayed cellular hypersensitivity appear to be major secondary pathogenic factors in ALD.",

      "title": "A Review of Addiction",
      "abstract": "Addiction to drugs and alcohol is often undiagnosed and untreated. Physicians are often unaware or have negative attitudes regarding these patients, such as the perception that treatment is ineffective. Addiction--psychological dependence with or without tolerance and withdrawal--is essentially compulsive uncontrolled substance use despite physical, psychological, or social consequences. We now have an understanding of the 2 major neurological pathways involved in addiction. First, the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, which is essential for survival, can be physically altered by drug abuse to result in uncontrolled cravings. Second, the decision-making prefrontal cortex, which suppresses inappropriate reward response, can also be altered by drug abuse. Thus, accelerated \"go\" signals and impaired \"stop\" signals result in uncontrolled use despite severe consequences. Further, addicts can be predisposed to addiction by genetic defects in reward pathway neurotransmission and stress-related developmental brain abnormalities. Relapse to drug use can occur because of stress or cue-related reward pathway stimulation or even by a single drug dose. Individualized treatment of addiction, including pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions, can be as successful as treatment of other chronic diseases. Several pharmaceuticals are available or under study for these disorders. Waiting for the addict to \"be ready\" for treatment can be dangerous and detoxification alone is often ineffective. The physician's role in treating addiction includes prevention, diagnosis, brief intervention, motivational interviewing, referral, and follow-up care. An understanding of the biological reality of addiction allows physicians to understand addicts as having a brain disease. Further, the reality of effective pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments for addiction allows physicians to be more optimistic in treating addicts. The challenge to the physician is to embrace the reality of addictive disease and fulfill his or her role in its treatment.",

      "title": "Memory of Traumatic Stress",
      "abstract": "Extreme stress alters the coding of events in memory and may lead to disorders of the trauma spectrum, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In order to understand the physiological basis and the common thread underlying PTSD, the concept of memory as it is related to trauma must be understood. Autobiographic memory can be divided into cold memories, including knowledge about life-time periods and specific events and hot memories, comprising emotional and sensory memories. Cold memories (On September 18 at 20:30 I was still working in my office) are usually connected with hot sensory memories, (black-masked, dark night, shooting) as well as with cognitive (I can't do anything), emotional (fear, sadness) and physiological elements (heart racing, fast breathing, sweating). Through this string of hot memories a fear network is built. Physiological changes in the brain and body of the survivor of a life-threatening experience, such as a response of the stress-related messengers (e.g., of the HPA axis) or the functioning and even structure of the medial temporal lobe and connected limbic networks in the brain, have been shown to be affected by traumatic stressors and are linked to the organization of memory. When we drive the organism down the defense cascade, when flight is not possible, fight futile and only a startling freeze is left in our evolutionary repertoire, functioning of the structures in the medial temporal lobe that are the portal for autobiographic memory is altered such that hot and cold memories lose their interconnectivity. Our data from survivors of severe violence and torture demonstrate functional alteration of fronto-temporal regions. In over 100 victims of severe and repeated torture, we observed a 94% prevalence of PTSD. In these patients, generators of abnormal slow waves indicated dysfunctional networks in the frontal lobe. Abnormalities in left fronto-temporal regions were connected with dissociative states. In addition a hyper-responsive fear-network can be demonstrated by rapid visual presentation of emotional material. In torture victims but not in controls, rapid presentation of affective pictorial stimuli activates frontal cortex. We hypothesize that it is this disconnection between hot and cold memories, indicated by abnormal brain waves, that leaves those experiencing flashbacks entangled in fear and anxiety. The victim is unable to place the flashback in time and space because the hot memory is not connected to the autobiographical cold memory. If this connection can be restored, the horror of the memory might be alleviated.",

      "abstract": "Neurosyphilis presents a significant diagnostic challenge in psychiatric settings due to its highly variable neuropsychiatric manifestations, which can mimic a range of other psychiatric disorders. This case report describes a 36-year-old male admitted with acute psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior. His clinical history revealed previously treated syphilis, with no subsequent follow-up, and recent progressive cognitive and behavioral changes, ultimately leading to a diagnosis of neurosyphilis (specifically general paresis) following serological confirmation. This case highlights the complexities in diagnosing neurosyphilis, as its symptoms often overlap with common psychiatric conditions, making it easy to overlook in routine assessments. Importantly, the diagnosis required a high index of suspicion due to the patient’s psychiatric presentation combined with a background of untreated syphilis. Considering neurosyphilis in the differential diagnosis can be challenging, especially when psychiatric symptoms like depression, cognitive decline, and psychosis appear in the absence of clear neurological signs and when there is no follow-up on prior infections. The resurgence of syphilis and its neurological complications remains a concern, particularly in psychiatric populations where risk factors such as substance use disorders, socioeconomic challenges, and limited access to healthcare are prevalent. This case underscores the critical role of psychiatrists in screening for syphilis, especially in patients at risk or in areas with high syphilis prevalence. Early and accurate diagnosis, coupled with appropriate treatment using penicillin, can halt disease progression and mitigate severe neuropsychiatric outcomes. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis in psychiatric patients and considering neurosyphilis in cases of unexplained psychiatric symptoms.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Developmental delay can be associated with epilepsy. Epilepsy might be either the cause of the delay of acquisitions (epileptogenic encephalopathy) or only one additional manifestation, the consequence of the underlying neurological pathology (encephalopathy with epilepsy); it is therefore not the only factor responsible for delay. Within the framework of encephalopathies with epilepsy a rigorous diagnosis is necessary with, in particular a cutaneous examination (neuro‐cutaneous syndromes), a precise clinical examination (anoxo‐ischaemic sequelae of the perinatal period), an EEG, a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as the search for associated abnomalities (cardiac, renal…). There are also epileptogenic encephalopathies such as age‐related syndromes: Hemiconvulsions‐Hemiplegia‐Epilepsy syndrome; Rasmussen's syndrome; Dravet's syndrome; myoclono‐astatic epilepsy (Doose). Age at onset and type of seizures, as well as ictal and interictal EEG finding provide valuable hints for a specific diagnosis, while other investigation are usually not contributive. Developmental delay and epilepsy are frequently associated. One of the first steps to diagnosis consists in trying to establish the eventual causal role of the epilepsy. Answering this question may prove to be of primary importance for the choice of a therapeutic strategy and/or further etiological investigations.",

      "abstract": "Psychological traumas may occur during childhood in the form of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and/or emotional neglect. Trauma may be experienced when a person experiences serious loss or his/her life is under grave threat. If such traumatic event is neither dealt effectively nor resolved completely, it may predispose such a person to development of mental health issues such as drug dependence including alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS). Persons who experience or suffer from childhood psychological trauma tend to consume alcohol in order to cope with their trauma related experiences. Hence, generally, onset of alcohol dependence is preceded by the occurrence of childhood psychological trauma(s). Childhood psychological trauma especially emotional abuse acts as a risk factor for the development of alexithymia in later life among persons with alcohol dependence. Alexithymia is a state of emotional dysregulation, which is characterized by the triad of difficulty in identifying one's own feelings, difficulty in distinguishing between the physical sensation and emotional arousal, and difficulty in explaining one's own feelings to others, which is known as externally oriented style of thinking. Alexithymia is itself a risk factor for the development of ADS. Thus, both childhood psychological trauma(s) and alexithymia play a significant role in the development of ADS. Findings of the present study showed that childhood psychological trauma(s), alexithymia, and ADS are interconnected. The present study findings conclude that significant relationship exists between childhood psychological traumas, alexithymia, and ADS.",

This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "abstract": "Symptoms of traumatic brain injury (TBI) tend to be primarily related to cognitive deficits involving the frontal and temporal brain areas as a result of biomechanical forces involving the bone and soft tissue of the head. Motions of acceleration and/ or deceleration can result in tissue strain, leading to hematomas and diffuse axonal injury. Alterations in blood flow, metabolic dysfunction, disruption of the bloodbrain barrier, calcium dysregulation, free radical formation, excitotoxicity, axonal damage, apoptosis (neuronal cell death), cerebral edema or brain swelling, and ischemia are possible factors involved in the pathophysiological cascade that can be initiated by TBI (Jain 2006; Mendez and Ardila, 2006; Sinson and McIntosh, 2006; and Stein, 2006). Focal TBI results from either contusions, or bruising involving these two brain areas, coup-contrecoup contusions, or penetrating injuries. Contusions tend to be involved as part of a larger picture of deficits from diffuse TBI although they can occur independently. Delayed neurobehavioral deterioration can occur following brain injury as a result of changes that occur from intracranial hematomas, diffuse cerebral swelling, considerable axonal injury, and further cellular changes resulting from the brain's increased sensitivity to secondary ischemic insult. Molecular events, such as the elevation of cytokines and changes in neurotrophic factors resulting in increased oxidative stress, can occur in even mild TBI.",

Insomnia, fatigue, and sleepiness are the most frequent sleep complaints after traumatic brain injury. Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and parasomnias may also occur after a head injury. In addition, depression, anxiety, and pain are common brain injury comorbidities with significant influence on sleep quality. Two types of traumatic brain injury that may negatively impact sleep are acceleration/deceleration injuries causing generalized brain damage and contact injuries causing focal brain damage. Polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and/or actigraphy may be utilized to diagnose sleep disorders after a head injury. Depending on the disorder, treatment may include the use of medications, positive airway pressure, and/or behavioral modifications. Unfortunately, the treatment of sleep disorders associated with traumatic brain injury may not improve neuropsychological function or sleepiness.

      "title": "Delayed Neuronal Degeneration Results from Endogenous Glutamate Excess",
      "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes clinical neurological dysfunction that may be acute, fluctuating, or progressive.1,2 The molecular basis for neuronal injury has not been elucidated, although antineuronal antibodies have been identified in some patients. Immune-mediated injury to vessels or to coagulation cascades that cause inflammatory vasculopathies or embolic or hemorrhagic phenomena can produce ischemia and neuron death, as in stroke, seizures, and spinal cord and peripheral nervous system disease.3 Questions about the mechanism of chronic neurological disease in SLE, such as encephalopathy, and cognitive and behavioral disorders, arise when the autoantibody markers for active SLE fail to correlate with the neurological symptoms.1,4,5 (For an alternate opinion, see ref. 6.) Some will argue that this failure amounts to inadequate methodology either in detection of autoantibodies or in detection of a cytokine imbalance that mediates central nervous system injury independent of autoantibodies. Alternatively, chronic or progressive neurological symptoms in SLE may not depend on the activity of the systemic disease. For example, neurologic disease in SLE could depend on nonimmune-mediated factors like infection and toxic effects of medications. There is another possible mechanism that would account for the failure of chronic or progressive neurological disease to correlate with systemic disease. Recent experiments in several different animal models suggest that an initial insult to the brain may initiate a cascade of events that ultimately lead to distal progressive neuron loss. Based on these studies it is possible that an immune insult could initiate injury and become resolved, but the neuron injury could continue in an expanding cascade without the presence of serum markers of immunologic disease. Building on experimental evidence that had demonstrated that the increased excitatory effect of glutamate and calcium influx causes neuronal death, studies on different animal models suggest that after an initial injury, neurons distant from the region of the first injury may die as the excitatory and inhibitory tone changes on downstream glutamate neurons.7–15 One experimental model demonstrated that ischemic or neurotoxic damage to the striatum caused, days later, the degeneration of 50% of the GABA neurons in the substantia nigra,13–15 although the substantia nigra was not damaged by the initial striatal injury. Behavioral changes in the animals correlated with the development of delayed neuronal degeneration.16 One possible mechanism for the delayed degeneration of GABA neurons in the substantia nigra reticulata depended on glutamatergic overactivity. A brief review of the critical feature of the anatomy of the striatonigral system shows that the substantia nigra reticulata receives inhibitory afferents from the striatum (caudate-putamen and globus pallidus), and excitatory glutamatergic afferents from the subthalamic nucleus. In the next experiment, ablation of the subthalamic nucleus occurred prior to the striatal injury. The nigral GABA neurons were completely protected from the endogenous excitotoxicity.14 These results suggest a central role for alterations of glutamate activity in chronic progressive neurological disease and raise the question of whether SLE cytokines or antibodies may provoke similar delayed neuronal injury by altering glutamatergic activity. In this hypothesis SLE cytokines or antibodies might affect upstream neurons and initiate a cascade of events that would evolve over a longer time, and lead eventually to neuronal death through overexcitation; alternatively SLE cytokines or antibodies might acutely affect glutamate receptors. This hypothesis would be plausible if SLE determined brain injury-affected neurons with excitatory or inhibitory activity on glutamatergic neurons or if SLE cytokines or antibodies demonstrated an effect on glutamate receptors. In fact, it has been demonstrated in SLE that microinfarcts and larger vessel occlusions destroy cortical, striatal, or thalamic brain regions with afferents to downstream glutamatergic neurons. Also, in SLE, defective regulation and function of interleukin-4, -6, and -10 have been recorded,17,18 and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that interleukin-6 protects neurons against glutamate-induced death.19 Interleukin-1-receptor antagonist also protects against excitotoxin-induced neuron death in in vivo experiments.20 Furthermore, some studies have identified a lymphocytotoxic antibody that cross-reacts with brain tissue.21 The recent finding, however, of autoantibodies to the glutamate receptor in patients with encephalitis and paraneoplastic syndrome22,23 may set the stage for a discovery of an autoantibody in SLE to the glutamate receptor. These data suggest that the search for the pathogenesis of the chronic neurological symptoms in SLE should also include the possibility that delayed neuronal degeneration may occur after the initial injury and need not necessarily associate with active SLE. Delayed neuronal degeneration might help explain the progressive or fluctuating neurologic impairments in systemic lupus erythematosus.",

Some individuals have severe symptoms that cause repeated and prolonged awakenings. Others are aware of only mild symptoms at bedtime that prolong falling asleep. Patients may complain of insomnia, especially difficulty with sleep onset and repeated nighttime awakenings. Most characteristic of restless legs syndrome are reports of sensations deep in the muscles. This disorder may begin at any age, including during childhood.

Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS).

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

      "abstract": "Clinical manifestations of disease are in the final analysis the result of altered physiologic or biochemical relations. This is true whether one observes the direct evidence of abnormal function or the compensatory reactions invoked to counteract abnormal forces. The central nervous system is no exception to this principle. And this is no less true whether one deals with disease directly involving the central nervous system or with the effects on it of disease having its origin elsewhere. This report is concerned with secondary effects. Neuropsychiatric complications of underlying disease may vary widely from mild aberrations of normal mood and behavior to sweeping disturbances that dominate the entire clinical picture and may obscure the disease itself. The basis for these reactions depends primarily on the fundamental nature of brain metabolism. The central nervous system has the most exacting metabolic requirements in the body. Unlike other tissues, it is primarily aerobic in",

La presencia de dolor cronico se ha asociado con un deterioro cognitivo leve, sobre todo en los pacientes afectados por fibromialgia o dolor neuropatico, habiendose relacionado esto con la concurrencia en estos pacientes, de otros procesos, como la ansiedad, la depresion, los trastornos del sueno y el consumo de ciertos farmacos, todos ellos habituales en los pacientes con dolor cronico. En esta revision, hacemos un repaso del complejo proceso de la cognicion asi como de los distintos elementos que lo integran. Asimismo, revisamos los mecanismos mediante los que el dolor cronico puede afectar el proceso de la cognicion y el modo en el que este puede verse afectado por la concurrencia de otras patologias, o por los farmacos habitualmente utilizados para su tratamiento. Finalmente se plantea la necesidad de evaluar el deterioro cognitivo en los pacientes con dolor cronico, con el objetivo de evitar la progresion de la enfermedad cognitiva hacia un cuadro de deterioro mas grave, asi como de contribuir a mejorar la respuesta terapeutica al dolor y el aumento de la calidad de vida de los pacientes. EnglishChronic pain constitutes a serious public health problem due to its high prevalence and the social and personal consequences. The presence of chronic pain has been associated with mild cognitive impairment, especially in patients with fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, and it has been also related with other disease like anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and the use of certain drugs, usually taken on these patients. This document revises the complex issue of the cognitive process and the several elements that comprise it. Likewise, we review the different mechanisms by which pain affect cognitive process and the way it could be affected by other disease, or by drugs commonly used on treatment. It is necessary to assess mild cognitive impairment on chronic pain patients, in order to prevent the develop and the evolution of cognitive disease to a more severe impairment, as well as help to improve therapeutic response to pain and increase health related quality of life of patients.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

      "title": "Therapeutics for the Treatment of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

Both the type of pathology and the location of the brain lesion are significant to the clinicians caring for an aphasic patient. Techniques that demonstrate lesion type and site are crucial to the neuropathology of aphasia. Several generalizations can be offered (Benson, 1979a): Aphasia is produced lry damage to brain structures. Neuropathological pro cesses that involve nonbrain portions of the nervous system (e.g., cranial nerves) and secondary neurological dysfunctions such as systemic or psychogenic disorders do not produce aphasic language syndromes. Metabolic and toxic disorders (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy) produce a broad, overall disruption of brain function, not a focal aphasia. Also, because language loss, by definition, is a requirement for aphasia, congenital and developmental disorders in which language failed to develop cannot be considered sources of aphasia.",

      "title": "Familial Dysautonomia",
      "abstract": "Familial dysautonomia or the Riley-Day syndrome was first described in 1949 with a report of five cases (14). Dysautonomia refers to the characteristic dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system upon which are superimposed both motor and sensory abnormalities; familial refers to the genetic nature of the abnormality, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait occurring almost exclusively in Jewish families of East European extraction (12). The clinical features may be grouped into major categories resulting from apparent dysfunction of the dominantly involved systems: (a) episodic hypertension and postural hypotension, transient (erythematous) blotching of the skin, cool extremities, excessive perspiration, hypolacrimation, episodic unexplained fever, episodic vomiting; (b) disordered swallowing, dysarthria, motor inco-ordination; (c) marked diminution in sensory modalities (notably pain and taste), decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, corneal hypesthesia (leading to corneal scarring). Additional, almost constant features are emotional lability, recurrent pulmonic infection, kyphoscoliosis, and other bony changes. The occasional occurrence of convulsions is noted, but mental retardation is not thought to be an important primary feature of this syndrome. Recent communications have emphasized the probably pathognomonic absence of the fungiform papillae of the tongue with the presumed absence of the associated taste buds; frequently there is concomitant absence of the circumvallate papillae (4, 15). Pharmacologic investigations have revealed hypersensitivity to both norepinephrine and methacholine, absence of normal responses to intradermal histamine, and restoration of many of the abnormal sensory and parasympathetic findings with infused methacholine (4, 16). Despite the wide array of symptomatology and despite the fact that the radiologist is frequently involved with the initial diagnosis of this disease because of the chronic and recurrent pneumonic episodes that often mimic cystic fibrosis, there is a dearth of radiographic literature available concerning this syndrome. Kirkpatrick and Riley in 1957 discussed the general radiographic findings (10). They found that chronic bronchopneumonia was the most common and important radiographic feature. They also reported the skeletal changes of abnormal and retarded growth, of kyphoscoliosis, and of traumatic sequelae in a large percentage of their cases. Of their 7 patients who underwent examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract, none showed any major abnormality, although one patient had nonpersistent pylorospasm. Linde and Westover in 1962 discussed the esophageal and gastric changes seen in their 6 patients (11). Difficulty in swallowing was present in 2.",

Relatively common after unilateral lesions are anosognosia and anosodiaphoria—that is, the denial of, or unconcern about, a sensorimotor hemisyndrome. Less familiar forms of altered limb perception include asomatognosia (lack of awareness of a part of the body), somatoparaphrenia (lack of ownership of a paralysed limb), the experience of supernumerary phantom limbs (reduplication of limbs on the affected side of the body), personification (nicknaming a limb and giving it an identity of its own) and misoplegia. The term misoplegia was coined by Critchley1,2 and refers to the morbid dislike or hatred of paralysed limbs in patients with hemiplegia. Minor manifestations of this condition may be restricted to verbal aggression towards a limb, but commonly misoplegia includes physical acts such as striking and beating the hemiplegic extremity.1–3 Although these verbal or physical acts of self-directed aggression are impressive, detailed case reports are rare.

      "title": "Differing roles for parvalbumin neurons after nerve injury",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is abnormal, persistent pain that is caused by injury to the somatosensory system. It commonly involves damage to the peripheral nerves as a result of physical trauma, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, infections such as HIV or shingles, or toxicity induced neuropathies as a result of cancer treatments. Neuropathic pain is common, with epidemiological studies suggesting that around 18–30% of American, European and Australian adults suffer from chronic pain. This leads to significant disabilities and suffering. People with chronic pain complain of spontaneous pains that may be electric-shock like or continuous. Often coexisting with these are abnormal, evoked sensations such as tactile allodynia (pain in response to innocuous stimuli e.g., light brush or pressure) and cold allodynia (pain in response to innocuous cooling), or hyperalgesia (increase pain in response to an already noxious stimulus), as well as ataxia and proprioceptive deficits. The management of these conditions is often suboptimal for two main reasons: firstly, an incomplete knowledge of the mechanisms that are involved (and which of them are the most important). Secondly, patients often have compliance issues with pharmacological medications (Attal, 2012). Both peripheral and central neuronal mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology and since the turn of the century particular emphasis has focussed on the role of glial cells in pain (West et al., 2015). Primary sensory afferents convey information about peripheral stimuli to the central nervous system (CNS). Their cell bodies are located in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and constitute a heterogeneous population that has been classified in several ways. Initially, they were split into the small dark and large light groups based on neurofilament (and myelination) content that correlated well with conduction velocities. With the advent of immunohistochemistry, and the discovery of different trophic factors, these groups were further subdivided into peptide-rich and peptide-poor nociceptors, low threshold mechanoreceptor and proprioceptor subgroups (Scott, 1992). Moreover, it is now known that different DRG neurons can express in > 30 different neurotransmitters or receptors associated with a wide variety of stimuli and that they show considerable phenotypic plasticity associated with peripheral injury (Fukuoka and Noguchi, 2002; West et al., 2015). Most of the attention has focussed on the changes associated with small DRG cells that primarily innervate skin, since these are presumed to be responsible for evoked pain sensations after injury. However, less attention has been paid to the effects of injury on proprioceptors in general, and muscle afferents in particular. This is, in part, due to the paucity of histological markers associated with such fibres. The most commonly used marker of proprioceptive (muscle) afferents is parvalbumin (PV) (Medici and Shortland, 2015). PV is a calcium binding protein that is found in subsets of sensory neurons, inhibitory interneurons and motoneurons. Studies that have explored the effects of nerve injury on muscle afferents reported no changes in its staining patterns after injury. However, those early studies used nerve injury models where injured and non-injured cell bodies coexist within the same DRG. Therefore, plasticity could occur without changing the absolute number of positive cells (downregulation in injured and upregulation in spared neurons). Now there are neuronal markers, such as activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which can identify damaged afferents and nerve injury models where the injured and non-injured cell bodies are spatially segregated in adjacent spinal ganglia (Shortland et al., 2006). This prompted us to reinvestigate whether or not PV positive cells show phenotypic plasticity (Medici and Shortland, 2015). We first determined that around 25% of L4–5 DRG cells innervating the sciatic nerve express PV. Following axotomy of the sciatic nerve, this number did not significantly change over 1–28 days, confirming earlier studies. Co-expression with the neuronal injury marker ATF3 showed that approximately half the PV cells were axotomised suggesting that both injured and uninjured neurons express PV after sciatic nerve injury. However, around 50–60% of the L4 & L5 DRG neurons contribute axons to the sciatic nerve, so by itself this result did not really answer whether or not phenotypic plasticity was happening, since for switching to occur, one might predict that little or no colocalisation with ATF3 should occur. Therefore, we switched to the spinal nerve ligation model and selectively lesioned the L5 spinal nerve, whilst being careful not to injure the adjacent L4 spinal nerve. In this model, essentially all DRG neurons were injured and expressed ATF3 (Shortland et al., 2006). The percentage of PV staining in the axotomized L5 DRG was unchanged compared to the adjacent L4 DRG, the contralateral L5 DRG and naïve L5 DRG. On the other hand, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) staining, which is an accepted marker of peptidergic nociceptor afferents, including muscle afferents, was completely abolished in the ipsilateral L5 DRG. Thus, these results unequivocally showed that nerve injury did not produce a phenotypic change in PV positive afferents. They also highlighted a clear difference between phenotypic plasticity in proprioceptors versus nociceptors in response to nerve injury. There is now increasing knowledge of the molecular and biochemical repertoire of proprioceptors. Proprioceptors contain several calcium binding proteins such as calcineurin, calretinin and calbindin. They also contain metabolic markers such as carbonic anhydrase and cytochrome oxidase and the enzyme α3Na+/K+ ATPase. Several ion channels are associated with proprioceptors such as Piezo 2, acid sensing ion channel-3 (ASIC3), transient receptor potential V2 (TRPV2), vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (vglut1) and other markers such as the PDZ scaffold protein whirlin. Piezo2, α3Na+/K+ ATPase and whirlin are specific markers for muscle spindles. Following nerve injury, muscle afferents become spontaneously active and can change their neurotransmitter content. They can upregulate galanin, neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but many of the markers do not change e.g., TRPV2, ASIC3, carbonic anhydrase, whilst the response to others such as Piezo 2 or whirlin are unknown. A key player in contributing to chronic pain appears to be the de novo expression of BDNF in muscle afferents (Michael et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2010). Recent evidence also implicates changes in the sodium channel Nav1.7 in proprioceptors as an important contributor to chronic pain (Fukuoka et al., 2015), as this is increased in muscle afferents after nerve injury. Yet the afferents retain their normal levels of PV. PV is important for regulating calcium homeostasis in a neuron. After nerve injury, muscle afferents have a reduced and redistributed presynaptic input onto homonymous motoneurons. Before injury, synapses were on the proximal dendrites, whilst after injury they were fewer in number and located further away from the soma. This explained the observations of weak excitatory post synaptic potentials to motoneurons and disappearance of stretch reflexes (Vincent et al., 2015). PV is found in the cell body and peripheral endings, but not in the central terminals of afferents in the spinal cord (Petitjean et al., 2015), suggesting PV is more important in physiological process such as speed of muscle contraction rather than neurotransmitter release. Nerve injury causes a selective loss of small, but not large-sized, DRG neurons and so PV may have a role in cell survival. Support for this idea comes from studies in motoneuron disease models, where PV is expressed in motoneuron groups that are resistant to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and over-expression studies where PV prevents excitotoxic cell death (Medici and Shortland, 2015). Although PV is not present in the central terminals of afferents in the spinal cord, PV staining is clearly present in the dorsal horn. This is associated with the cell bodies and dendrites of a subset of inhibitory interneurons located in lamina IIi-III. Recent pharmacogenetic and selective ablation studies have shown that these PV neurons play a key gate keeping role in mechanical allodynia associated with nerve injury (Petitjean et al., 2015). These neurons receive input from low threshold cutaneous afferents and in turn provide presynaptic inhibition of A-fibres as well as postsynaptic inhibition to PKCγ excitatory interneurons. Nerve injury induces a 50% loss of synaptic appositions between PV interneurons and PKCγ interneurons resulting in disinhibition of pain circuits, without causing any death of PV neurons. Moreover, selective pharmacological blockade of PKCγ neurons attenuated the injury-induced mechanical allodynia (Petitjean et al., 2015). Two other circuits have also been proposed for regulating nociceptive transmission: one involves the inhibition of somatostatin (SOM)-positive excitatory interneurons by dynorphin (Dyn)-positive inhibitory interneurons. The second involves vesicular glutamate transport 3 (vGlut3)-positive excitatory interneurons which regulate activity in PKCγ or calretinin-positive excitatory interneurons (Gangadharan and Kuner, 2015). Under normal conditions, the vGlut3 interneurons are under powerful inhibitory control but after nerve injury they can drive mechanical allodynia (Arcourt and Lechner, 2015; Gangadharan and Kuner, 2015). Future experiments should determine whether PV interneurons also gate connections with these two neuronal subpopulations. A final layer of complexity is added by the presence of another DRG subpopulation that can cause allodynia after nerve injury. C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (CLTMs) are attributed to conveying sensations of pleasant touch in normal circumstances but produce allodynia after injury (Nagi et al., 2011; Samour et al., 2015). These fibres have a unique molecular repertoire and terminate in lamina IIi of the cord onto central, stalked and vertical cells (Arcourt and Lechner, 2015). Since PV cells have these morphologies (Hughes et al., 2012) they are ideally placed to receive input from such afferents, although this speculation requires confirmation. Taken together, the results of our and other studies suggest that PV is an important protein related to sensory pathways and the plasticity that occurs after injury (Figure 1). We demonstrated that in primary afferents, PV did not change and so can still be used as an anatomical marker of proprioceptors to explore changes in other transmitters, ion channels or transcription factors after peripheral nerve injury. In the CNS, PV may confer preferential survival to excitotoxic insults and importantly gates abnormal sensory information after injury.Figure 1: Overview of the different roles of PV neurons in pain circuits of the spinal cord.PV identifies sensory proprioceptive afferents that make monosynaptic connections with lower motoneurons (MN). After injury, PV levels in DRG neurons remains unchanged but there is a loss of presynaptic terminals from MNs resulting in reduced motor function. In the spinal cord, PV identifies a subset of inhibitory dorsal horn interneurons that gate information from Aβ afferents by presynaptically inhibiting A-fibres and postsynaptically inhibiting PKCγ excitatory interneurons. Additionally, Aβ afferents contact other inhibitory (e.g., Dyn and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)) and excitatory (e.g., SOM) interneurons forming a circuit that regulates nociceptive transmission. Nerve injury alters the synaptic efficacy and results in decreased activation of inhibitory PV cells and increased activation of excitatory neurons (e.g., vGlut3, PKCγ and SOM) and so results in changes in the neuronal circuitry such that innocuous stimuli can now produce behavioural hypersensitivities such as mechanical and cold allodynia. DRGs: Dorsal root ganglia; Aβ: low threshold mechanoreceptor afferents; SOM: somatostatin; vGlut3: vesicular glutamate transport 3; PKCγ: protein kinase C-γ",

      "abstract": "Daytime breathing problems caused by neurologic lesions always worsen during sleep, and in certain cases abnormal breathing patterns are only seen during sleep or specific sleep states. The first clinical manifestation of maltase deficiency, myopathy, or myotonic dystrophy is often a sleep-related complaint, such as unexplained waking from sleep (insomnia) or daytime somnolence. Thus, systematic investigation during sleep of disorders impairing the loop involved in breathing is strongly encouraged. Lesions may involve sensory receptors, sensory pathways, brainstem-controlling neurons, upper motor neurons, descending motor pathways, lower motor neurons, motor nerves, neuromuscular junctions, or respiratory muscles. Most of these lesions lead to a decrease in or absence of inspiratory efforts (diaphragmatic apnea or hypopnea) during sleep. These events differ from the classic obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the recently described upper airway resistance syndrome, which usually involve mild or significant anatomic abnormalities of the upper airway and craniofacial region. The treatment of abnormal breathing during sleep has been improved by the development of nasal ventilation methods: continuous positive airway pressure, intermittent positive pressure, and volume ventilation. These therapeutic approaches can prevent tracheostomy and diaphragmatic pacing and are more efficacious than drug treatments. Long-term compliance is generally much better in breathing disorders secondary to neurologic impairments than in cases of mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.",

      "title": "Neuroticism is a fundamental domain of personality with enormous public health implications",
      "abstract": "Neuroticism is the trait disposition to experience negative affects, including anger, anxiety, self-consciousness, irritability, emotional instability, and depression1. Persons with elevated levels of neuroticism respond poorly to environmental stress, interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and can experience minor frustrations as hopelessly overwhelming. Neuroticism is one of the more well established and empirically validated personality trait domains, with a substantial body of research to support its heritability, childhood antecedents, temporal stability across the life span, and universal presence1, 2. Neuroticism has enormous public health implications3. It provides a dispositional vulnerability for a wide array of different forms of psychopathology, including anxiety, mood, substance, somatic symptom, and eating disorders1, 4. Many instances of maladaptive substance use are efforts to quell or quash the dismay, anxiousness, dysphoria, and emotional instability of neuroticism. Clinically significant episodes of anxiety and depressed mood states will often represent an interaction of the trait or temperament of neuroticism with a life stressor1. Neuroticism is comparably associated with a wide array of physical maladies, such as cardiac problems, disrupted immune functioning, asthma, atopic eczema, irritable bowel syndrome, and even increased risk for mortality2. The relationship of neuroticism to physical problems is both direct and indirect, in that neuroticism provides a vulnerability for the development of these conditions, as well as a disposition to exaggerate their importance and a failure to respond effectively to their treatment. Neuroticism is also associated with a diminished quality of life, including feelings of ill-will, excessive worry, occupational failure, and marital dissatisfaction5. High levels of neuroticism will contribute to poor work performance due to emotional preoccupation, exhaustion, and distraction. Similar to the duel-edged effect of neuroticism on physical conditions, high levels of neuroticism will result in actual impairment to marital relationships but also subjective feelings of marital dissatisfaction even when there is no objective basis for such feelings, which can though in turn lead to actual spousal frustration and withdrawal. Given the contribution of neuroticism to so many negative life outcomes, it has been recommended that the general population be screened for clinically significant levels of neuroticism during routine medical visits1, 6. Screening in the absence of available treatment would be problematic. However, neuroticism is responsive to pharmacologic intervention1. Pharmacotherapy can and does effectively lower levels of the personality trait of neuroticism. Barlow et al7 have also developed an empirically-validated cognitive-behavioral treatment of neuroticism, called the Unified Protocol (UP). They have suggested that current psychological treatments have become overly specialized, focusing on disorder-specific symptoms. The UP was designed to be transdiagnostic. Recognizing the impact of neuroticism across a diverse array of physical and mental health care concerns, the authors of the UP again note that \"the public-health implications of directly treating and even preventing the development of neuroticism would be substantial\"7. Neuroticism has long been recognized since the beginning of basic science personality research and may even be the first domain of personality that was identified within psychology1. Given its central importance for so many different forms of mental and physical dysfunction, it is not surprising that neuroticism is evident within the predominant models of personality, personality disorder, and psychopathology. Neuroticism is one of the fundamental domains of general personality included within the five-factor model or Big Five2. It is also within the dimensional trait model included in Section III of the DSM-5 for emerging measures and models8. This trait model consists of five broad domains, including negative affectivity (along with detachment, psychoticism, antagonism, and disinhibition). As expressed in the DSM-5, \"these five broad domains are maladaptive variants of the five domains of the extensively validated and replicated personality model known as the 'Big Five' or Five Factor Model of personality\"8. Neuroticism is likewise aligned with the negative affective domain included within the dimensional trait model of personality disorder proposed for the ICD-119. Finally, it is also evident within the transdiagnostic Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of the National Institute of Mental Health, as RDoC negative valence encapsulates such constructs as fear, distress, frustration, and perceived loss10. It would be inaccurate to suggest that RDoC negative valence is equivalent to neuroticism, but it is self-evident that they are closely aligned. Currently, there is considerable interest in the general factors of psychopathology, personality disorder, and personality. To the extent that degree of impairment and dysfunction (which largely defines the general factors) is associated with level of distress and dismay, which is quite likely to be the case, we would propose that neuroticism will explain a substantial proportion of the variance in those general factors. In sum, neuroticism is a fundamental domain of personality that has enormous public health implications, impacting a wide array of psychopathological and physical health care concerns. It contributes to the occurrence of many significantly harmful life outcomes, as well as impairing the ability of persons to adequately address them. It has long been recognized as one of the more important and significant domains of personality and is being increasingly recognized as a fundamental domain of personality disorder and psychopathology more generally.

For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS).

      "abstract": "Introduccion : El dolor agudo constituye una compleja constelacion de experiencias sensoriales y emocionales, relacionadas con respuestas autonomas producidas por dano a estructuras somaticas o viscerales. Las vias del dolor transmiten la informacion nociceptiva a traves del sistema nervioso periferico y central y estan plenamente integradas con el sistema motor y simpatico a nivel medular y de los centros nerviosos superiores y dan lugar a actividad motora refleja, hiperactividad simpatica y respuestas afectivas y conductuales. Objetivo : Definir los mecanismos fisiopatologicos que se desencadenan en presencia de dolor agudo y las alteraciones que consecuentemente generan en diferentes organos y sistemas. Desarrollo : Las respuestas generadas a nivel segmentario, suprasegmentario y cortical dan lugar a alteraciones fisiopatologicas en el sistema cardiovascular, respiratorio y en otros organos y sistemas. Estas alteraciones pueden modificar negativamente el curso de la lesion o enfermedad que origino el dolor y provocar graves trastornos hemodinamicos que pueden llevar a la muerte del paciente. Conclusiones : Aunque el dolor agudo tiene una funcion biologica protectora, cuando es persistente o no mitigado provoca alteraciones fisiopatologicas en los diferentes organos y sistemas que son nocivas para el paciente. Pese al rapido progreso alcanzado en el conocimiento de su fisiopatologia y el desarrollo de novedosas y efectivas tecnicas para su tratamiento, la conducta terapeutica del paciente con dolor agudo es inadecuada.",

      "abstract": "NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION IS ARCHIVED. IT IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. Clinical characteristics Leukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",

Only tasks assessing alerting/vigilance are strongly related to fatigue. Areas with brain atrophy in fatigue patients overlap with brain regions activated in healthy controls performing alerting/vigilance tasks. Fatigue is not a compensatory state, nor a psychogenic trait. It is a feeling with behavioral effects that seems to be caused by brain atrophy or a neurochemical dysfunction of the alerting/vigilance system.",

      "title": "Phenomenology and psychiatric origin of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES) is a sudden change in a person's behavior, perception, thinking, or feeling that is usually time limited and resembles, or is mistaken for, epilepsy but does not have the characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that accompanies a true epileptic seizure [1]. It is considered that PNES is a somatic manifestation of mental distress, in response to a psychological conflict or other Stressors [2]. A wide spectrum of clinical presentation includes syncope, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, simple and complex partial seizure, myoclonic seizure, frontal lobe seizures and status epilepticus [3]. Coexistence of epilepsy and PNES is seen in approximately 9% of cases [5]. Between 25-30% of patients referred to tertiary centers and initially diagnosed as refractory epilepsy were on further examination diagnosed as PNES [6,7]. In DSM-IV [12] PNES are usually categorized under conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions. However, psychiatric basis of PNES may be anxiousness (panic attack), somatization or factitious disorder, simulation, dissociative disorders and psychosis [1]. AIM The aim of the study was to establish clinical phenomenology and EEG characteristics as well as basic psychiatric disorder in patients with PNES. METHOD In a retrospective study covering the period from January 1st 1999 till April 31 st 2003, 24 patients (22 female, 2 male) treated at the Institute of Neurology in Belgrade were analyzed. PNES were defined as sudden change in behavior incoherent with epileptiform activity registered on EEG. Possible PNES were determined on the basis of history data and clinical examination during the attack but definitive confirmation was established only by the finding of no ictal EEG changes during typical seizure of each patient. Patients with coexisting epilepsy were included in the study, too. At least two standard EEG (range 2-6, median 4) were performed at the beginning of diagnostic evaluation. Demographic data, clinical presentation (apparent loss of consciousness, type of convulsion and associated clinical signs) and placebo-induced seizures (administration of saline near the cubital vein) with EEG or video-EEG monitoring were analyzed. Basic psychiatric disorder was classified according to DSM IV classification criteria. RESULTS Duration of PNES was 4.7 years (range from 2 months to 30 years). The time from onset to the diagnosis of PNES was 4.5 years. Epilepsy comorbidity was diagnosed in 9 patients (37.5%). The average time of use of antiepileptic drugs (AED) in the group of isolated PNES was 2.4 years and 20% of patients were treated with two or more AED. The vast majority of patients presented with bilateral convulsions (54.16%) with apparent loss of consciousness found in 91.6% of cases. Ictal iwury (16.7%), tongue bite (4.2%) and premonition of the seizure (17.4%) were uncommon. Variability in clinical presentation of seizures was found in over half of patients (57%). Psychological trigger could be determined in over 60% of patients. EEG findings in a group with isolated PNES suggesting the existence of epileptiform activity was found in one case. EEG monitoring of placebo-induced seizure was performed in 20 patients, of whom 19 (95%) showed typical habitual attack with no electroclinical correlate. In 70% of cases conversion disorder DSM-IV criteria were fulfilled. Somatization disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder were found in 3 patients. The diagnosis of factitious disorder was made in one case and only two patients were undiagnosed according to DSM-IV. DISCUSSION Average delay from onset to diagnosis of PNES in larger studies was estimated to be approximately 7 years [8]. Even though diagnostic delay in our study was shorter, organizational reasons for this could not be found. Longer duration of a typical attack (compared to the epileptic seizure), apparent loss of consciousness, bilateral convulsion behavior and significant clinical variability in absence of typical epileptic elements such as tongue bite and ictal iwury could be the main clinical manifestation of PNES. We found rare interictal abnormalities (6.7%) in the group with isolated PNES and significant percentage (77.7%) in patients with coexisting epilepsy which is coherent with other reports [8]. The latest could lead to prolonged delay in appropriate diagnosis and suitable treatment. Clear psychological trigger wasn't noted in whole group of patients (61 %). This, however, is not unusual since PNES represents a chronic disorder with repeated triggering that could lead to less significant role of the same psychological trigger in developed PNES. Even insufficiently resolved in ethical terms, placebo-induced procedure was of huge sensitivity. In clinical practice conversion disorder is hard to differ from malingering or implementation of secondary gain. One could make the conclusion only on the basis of detailed and careful estimation of the symptoms developing context Conversion disorder is more prevalent among women (from 2:1 to 10:1) [4, 13] but modest percentage of affected men could be explained only by limited sample in this study. CONCLUSION PNES is often replaced with epilepsy and in number of cases clinical differentiation is not easy. One should be acquainted with clinical presentation of PNES as well as its psychiatric origin in order to adequately recognize and treat the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) is a common condition with a significant impact on quality of life and general health. A mild form of sleepiness can be associated with reduced reactivity and modest distractibility symptoms, but more severe symptomatic forms are characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrollable need to sleep, causing sudden sleep attacks, amnesia and automatic behaviors. The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances. An accurate medical history cannot be sufficient for the differential diagnosis, therefore instrumental recordings by means of polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are mandatory for a correct diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of EDS.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by the breakdown of thought processes and emotional disorders. This disease is characterized by a combination of disorders: cognitive (impaired attention, memory, thinking) and behavioral, productive (hallucinatory, delusional, affective, etc.) and negative (apathy, abulia, emotional and social detachment, etc.) symptoms. Schizophrenia causes psychosis, can be accompanied by disability and negatively affect all areas of life, including personal, social life, family and work activities. This disease is also characterized by changes in emotions, loss of concentration, autism, asociality (\"immersion in oneself\", unusual thoughts and fantasies), a drop in energy state and a violation of the will. The sick person does not understand that he is ill, and this complicates treatment. Psychoses become more frequent over time and this leads to frequent hallucinations, and they can affect all the senses. The most common are auditory hallucinations in the form of voices and a person's subordination to voices, which can make the situation dangerous. The absence of treatment for schizophrenia leads to an absolute loss of one's own \"I\", loss of a person's personality, and during an exacerbation of the disease, a person can harm first of all himself and then others. The following research article examines all the factors that can influence the onset and progression of the disease.",

This corresponds to a prolonged alteration of the mental state with continuous or sub-continuous generalized spikes or spike-wave discharges on the EEG. The prototype is absence status (petit mal status, spike-wave stupor, minor epileptic status),13,14 where there is clouding of awareness but, presumably, no specific cognitive deficit. Apathy, drowsiness, slowness, inattention, perplexity, strange affect, amnesia, slow speech are the most obvious abnormal behaviors. It is not clear to what degree higher-level mental functions are truly preserved and what new memories can be formed during these episodes: detailed studies are rare.15These NCSE can be phases in primary generalized epilepsies, but may be manifestations of complex partial status epilepticus of temporal or frontal origin.15 In temporal partial status epilepticus, only limited purposeful organized activity and responses to outside stimuli are possible and there is usually a total amnesia for the period. The epileptic nature is recognized by the presence, often subtle, of automatic motor behavior and vegetative phenomena.16,17 A special form of frequent refractory nonconvulsive partial status epilepticus, associated with ring chromosome 20, is probably of frontal origin and, because it is so frequent, should allow exploration of the affected and preserved behaviors and memories during seizures.18,19",

Clues to the neural substrates of religious-numinous experience may be gleaned from temporolimbic epilepsy, near-death experiences, and hallucinogen ingestion. These brain disorders and conditions may produce depersonalization, derealization, ecstasy, a sense of timelessness and spacelessness, and other experiences that foster religious-numinous interpretation. Religious delusions are an important subtype of delusional experience in schizophrenia, and mood-congruent religious delusions are a feature of mania and depression. The authors suggest a limbic marker hypothesis for religious-mystical experience.

      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

As a normal mood, depression is a common human reaction to a significant loss; as a medical term, it is also used to describe the sadness seen in patients who have other severe medical and psychiatric disorders. Most often, however, \"depression\" refers to a group of psychiatric syndromes or illnesses with well defined symptoms only one of which is sadness. Depression syndromes are probably universal. There are accounts of depressive illness throughout history from almost every human society. The universality of depressive illness is also reflected in the frequency of depression as a theme of the world's great literature. Studies of the biochemical correlates of psychotic depression have focused on two major hypotheses. The first proposes that affective disorders result from functional changes in the central noradrenergic systems. The second postulates that the primary abnormality is in central serotonergic pathways. These two hypotheses are supported by the pharmacological effects of antidepressant drugs.",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

      "abstract": "The peripheral nerves consist of bundles of long neuronal axons as they exit the central nervous system (CNS). Some peripheral nerves are wrapped in a myelin sheath generated by Schwann cells, whereas others are unmyelinated. Peripheral nerves serve different motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. The term peripheral neuropathy is usually used to describe symmetric and universal damage to adjacent nerves. The damage and clinical manifestations are usually located distally with a proximal progression. Several disorders can damage peripheral nerves and cause peripheral neuropathy; it is important to differentiate actual neuropathy from other disorders that can have a similar clinical presentation [1]. The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy necessitates a thorough workup of possible etiologies to identify immune-mediated causes that are amenable to immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. Importantly, patients may occasionally suffer from more than one disease-causing their peripheral neuropathy. Clinically relevant co-comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, chronic alcohol abuse, etc. need to be considered. Evidence-based guidelines and diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy have been published for specific neuropathic phenotypes such as distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy, small fiber neuropathy, or inflammatory neuropathies. However, they are only applicable for specific neuropathic conditions or when a specific diagnosis is already suspected on clinical grounds. By focusing on the initial steps of the diagnostic workup, this standard operating procedure provides a practical guideline including clinical and additional diagnostic parameters that help to identify the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy [2].",

      "title": "Aberrant Hippocampal Neuroregenerative Plasticity in Schizophrenia: Reactive Neuroblastosis as a Possible Pathocellular Mechanism of Hallucination",
      "abstract": "Hallucination is a sensory perception that occurs in the absence of external stimuli during abnormal neurological disturbances and various mental diseases. Hallucination is recognized as a core psychotic symptom and is particularly more prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia. Strikingly, a significant number of subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and other neurological diseases like cerebral stroke and epileptic seizure also experience hallucination. While aberrant neurotransmission has been linked to the neuropathogenic events of schizophrenia, the precise cellular mechanism accounting for hallucinations remains obscure. Neurogenesis is a cellular process of producing new neurons from the neural stem cells (NSC)-derived neuroblasts in the brain that contribute to the regulation of pattern separation, mood, olfaction, learning, and memory in adulthood. Impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the adult brain has been linked to stress, anxiety, depression, and dementia. Notably, many neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the mitotic and functional activation of neuroblasts and cell cycle re-entry of mature neurons leading to a drastic alteration in neurogenic process, known as reactive neuroblastosis. Considering their neurophysiological properties, the abnormal integration of neuroblasts into the existing neural network or withdrawal of their connections can lead to abnormal synaptogenesis, and neurotransmission. Eventually, this would be expected to result in altered perception accounting for hallucination. Thus, this article emphasizes a hypothesis that aberrant neurogenic processes at the level of reactive neuroblastosis could be an underlying mechanism of hallucination in schizophrenia and other neurological diseases.",

      "abstract": "A variety of autonomic nervous system (ANS) disorders are now being recognized with increasing frequency. They can range from autonomic disturbances associated with common medical problems, such as diabetes to various syndromes of acute, subacute, and chronic autonomic failure. Intracranial pathology is frequently associated with acute autonomic dysfunction which may result in life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Several neurological disorders such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), stroke, seizures, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are frequently observed to be accompanied by electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and myocardial damage. Many other conditions, such as delirium, coma, and loss of consciousness in epilepsy and stroke are important autonomic crises. Clinical signs and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction are often overlooked by physicians or overshadowed by more prominent language, behavioral, motor and sensory findings. The increasing awareness of progressive autonomic dysfunction affecting the course of many human diseases is leading to more accurate and rapid diagnosis and proper management of autonomic failure (AF) (1,2).",

Making a correct diagnosis can be difficult as patients most often turn for help in the depression phase; they also tend to interpret the hypomania phase as a state of very good mood and increased creativity, not identifying it with the disease. A depressive episode in the course of BPAD is characterised by the frequent coexistence of psychotic symptoms, excessive sleepiness and increased appetite. The first episode of the disease most often occurs at a young age. Apart from the typical symptoms of the depressive syndrome, we often observe accompanying cognitive disorders, which represent a group of symptoms causing significant discomfort and suffering to the patient. They most often intensify with the development of the disease and the number of subsequent episodes. In particular, the effectiveness of attention processes, executive functions and memory is weakened. These deficits have a negative impact on the patients’ day-to-day functioning at school, in the workplace and in society, and severely impair it. The case report presented herein shows the difficulties in diagnosing severe cognitive disorders during a depressive episode in the course of BPAD and the difficulties in differentiating between them and dementia, as well as presents the effects of electroconvulsive therapy.",

Neuromuscular diseases include neuronopathies, neuropathies, myasthenic syndromes, and myopathies. An accurate neurological examination and complementary investigations are necessary for both diagnosis and for evaluating the severity of the disease. Assessment of respiratory muscle function is a key step in deciding the need for mechanical ventilation and subsequently its weaning. Hypercapnia often indicates an impending respiratory arrest, but normocapnia, which can be seen in a patient with severe reduction in vital capacity is not reassuring. Hypoxaemia can be due to hypercapnia, pulmonary injury (atelectasis or pneumonia), or pulmonary embolism. Cardiac evaluation is important as cardiomyopathies are frequent in myopathies.",

      "title": "Other Uses: Psychosis, Pregnancy, and Status Epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Although ECT was developed as a treatment for schizophrenia, its ease of use, its safety, and the lack of effective treatments for many psychiatric conditions encouraged experimentation with this therapy to treat other disorders. These explorations define a cluster of conditions— acute and chronic psychosis, psychiatric disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period, and intractable seizure disorders—in which ECT has a clinical role. Strongly held beliefs (delusions), abnormal sensory experiences (hallucinations, illusions) that are not based upon reality, and beliefs that others are paying special attention or plotting harm to the subject (paranoid thoughts) impair social functioning and disrupt family life. Thought disorders are the central peculiarity of schizophrenia but are also frequently found in patients with depression, mania, toxic states, and brain disorders. Regardless of the cause or the associated signs and symptoms, treatment can reduce the psychosis. This benefit is often given small notice, however, because ECT is widely regarded as an antidepressant, not an antipsychotic, treatment. The relief of psychosis afforded by ECT varies with the underlying condition. Disorders in thought in patients with depression or mania are readily relieved. Indeed, the more severe form of psychotic depression is relieved more rapidly than nonpsychotic depression. When ECT is used to treat patients with malignant catatonia and delirium, the psychosis is relieved at the same time as the toxic state. When psychosis dominates the clinical condition without other features, schizophrenia is the usual diagnosis. For acute schizophrenia dominated by the positive symptoms of paranoia, catatonia, or excitement, ECT is quite helpful. It is not helpful for the chronic varieties dominated by passivity and withdrawal, the negative signs of the illness. The clinical approach to the diagnosis of a psychotic condition is to exclude other causes for psychosis first and reserve the label “schizophrenia” for the residue of “not otherwise diagnosed” psychotic conditions. While we are able to ameliorate the psychoses in mood disorders and toxic states, palliation and symptom reduction are the best that we can offer other psychotic patients. Electroconvulsive therapy and insulin coma therapy were the main treatments for psychosis at the time when Thorazine and other new antipsychotic drugs were introduced in the 1950s.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating multi-systemic chronic illness of unknown etiology, classified as a neurological disorder by the World Health Organization (WHO). The symptomatology of the condition appears to emanate from a variety of sources of chronic neurological disturbance and associated distortions, and chronicity, in noxious sensory signaling and neuroimmune activation. This article incorporates a summary review and discussion of biomedical research considered relevant to this essential conception perspective. It is intended to provide stakeholders with a concise, integrated outline disease model in order to help demystify this major public health problem. The primary etiopathological factors presented are: (A) Postural/biomechanical pain signaling, affecting adverse neuroexcitation, in the context of compression, constriction, strain, or damage of vertebral-regional bone and neuromuscular tissues; (B) Immune mediated inflammatory sequelae, in the context of prolonged immunotropic neurotrophic infection-with lymphotropic/gliotropic/glio-toxic varieties implicated in particular; (C) A combination of factors A and B. Sustained glial activation under such conditions is associated with oxidative and nitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, and neural sensitivity. These processes collectively enhance the potential for multi-systemic disarray involving endocrine pathway aberration, immune and mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurodegeneration, and tend toward still more intractable synergistic neuro-glial dysfunction (gliopathy), autoimmunity, and central neuronal sensitization.",

Yet, several reasons compel us to revisit it here and devote a separate chapter to it. To begin with, the syndrome is not exclusively due to degenerative diseases; other, non-progressive lesions may also cause it. More importantly, its nature raises basic questions: Is the syndrome distinct from other forms of loss of knowledge, namely aphasia and agnosia, and, if so, how? Do episodic and semantic memories entail the same or different sets of mnemonic operations and cerebral mechanisms, and how is the meaning of facts, concepts, and symbols coded and arranged in the cortex?

      "title": "Effect of optimism/pessimism attitude on depression and coping strategies",
      "abstract": "Depression is a word used by mental health professional to refer an illness or group of illness called mood disorder. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. It's impossible to escape life's ups and downs. Feeling unhappy or sad in response to disappointment, loss, frustration or a medical condition is normal. Many people use the word to explain these kinds of feelings, but that is really situational depression, which is a normal reaction to events around us. Clinical depression, though, overwhelms and engulfs your day to day life, interfering with your ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and have fun. It is unrelenting, with little if any relief. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for an extended period of it.There is a difference, however, between a normal grief reaction and one that is disabling or unrelenting. While there's no set timetable for grieving, if it doesn't let up over time or extinguishes all signs of joy laughing at a good joke, brightening in response to a hug, appreciating a beautiful sunsetit may be depression. Brown and Haris (1978) reported that depression increases with the age due to several factors of day today life like burden of responsibility, sleeping problems, declining health etc.Coping strategies refer to the specific efforts, both behavioral and psychological, that people employ to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize stressful events.There are many different ways of coping but they all involve making some change in input-output relationships. Thus some methods of coping involve changing, controlling and even avoiding certain inputs, whether the problem is attacked by working on inputs that in internal processes or outputs, it will be one of the two major ways of adjustingdefensive coping or direct coping. Defensive coping involves protecting oneself by getting away from threatening inputs. Direct coping involves meeting challenges head on. Coping with stress may begin with the occurrence of a stressful even, during exposure to stressor and finally after it has taken places. However, successful coping with stress should depend on a number of factors such as individual attitude, perception of life stress and suffering and personal skills, capability of problem solving and decision making. Raju, Rohini, and Naga (2008) revealed that among the old age people 21.3% of them were severely depressed and diabetes is experienced mostly by the elderly whose age is between 70-80 years. The severely depressed older adults were suffering with blood pressure and asthma. The mildly depressed older adult's experiences suicidal tendencies, hearing problems, loneliness, diabetes and problem with the eyes.Sahu, (2007) found gender differences on life stress and significant negative relationship between life stress and coping was observed. It was also extended for males but this relationship was not found significant for females. Folkman, S. and Lazarus, R.S (1980) evaluated age difference in the use of problem focused coping and emotion focused coping among individuals aged 45 to 64. The younger group was found to use emotion focused approach more i.e. they used more of accepting responsibility, distancing more than o lder group.Considering the above facts the present study was undertaken to observe the Optimists and Pessimists on Depression and Coping strategies.Hypotheses of the studyTo achieve the main objective of the study following hypothesis are framed;* Optimists will have significantly low level of Depression as compared to Pessimists and its dimensions.* Optimists and pessimists will differ significantly on the tendency of using Coping Strategies and its dimensions.MethodParticipantsThe total sample was consisted of 255 optimists and 191 pessimists subjects. …",

      "abstract": "This chapter describes the specific clinical syndromes associated with drugs of abuse. Drug abuse is associated with many medical problems and complications stemming both from regular use and from overdoses. Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

      "abstract": "The article considers the impact of anxiety on the qualitative characteristics of man and the problems of his theoretical research in the field of psychology.Theconcept of anxiety in psychology is the ability of a person to feel different discomforts depending on the experience in different situations. Everyone has a level of anxiety called temporary and normal. If a person wants, he can overcome it. And if anxiety persists for a long time, it will not be able to cope on its own, and this will have a negative impact on human health and disrupt normalcy. Increased levels of anxiety, along with the emergence of various diseases, lead to a significant decline in quality of life. There are psychological and physiological manifestations of anxiety, which are determined by certain methods in science. The most obvious of the psychological symptoms -obscure problems -unjustified tense experiences.In psychology, anxiety is an emotional state with a negative connotation. Anxiety is characterized by the expectation of something negative, such as an adverse outcome or adverse outcome. Anxiety is a person's experience in different situations (joy, sorrow, shame, anger, fear, etc.). Anxiety is associated with a mental state, which is a person's emotional state and various feelings that indicate anxiety. Anxiety is associated with a mental state, which is a person's emotional state and various feelings that indicate anxiety. Forexample: confusion, anxiety, excitement, indifference, impatience, delay, etc. There are other meanings of the mental state of anxiety, which are: depression -a shameful mental state accompanied by anxiety; Propaganda is a phenomenon that takes place notonly in a state of anxiety, but also in a state of anger and rage; grief is a state of mind accompanied by anxiety, worry, grief, mental state is a state of mind, violence is a state of mind, grief accompanied by long-term anxiety, etc., so anxiety is a double state of mind.",

      "abstract": "Time for primary review 28 days.\n\nMore than any other organ of the body, brain integrity depends on the continuous blood supply of oxygen and glucose for covering the energy demands of the tissue. Cessation or severe reduction of blood flow results in almost instantaneous biochemical and functional deficits which become rapidly irreversible unless blood flow is promptly restored. The ischemia time that is tolerated by the brain depends, among others, on the density of ischemia, the tissue concentration of primary and secondary energy stores and the rate of energy consumption which, in turn, depends on the temperature, the degree of functional activity and the absence or presence of anesthetics and other drugs. There is also a major difference between the ischemic vulnerability of different regions of the brain. As an example, the CA1 sector of hippocampus may suffer irreversible injury after ischemia of as short as 5 min [94]whereas other nerve cell populations survive normothermic cerebrocirculatory arrest of as long as 1 h [77].\n\nThe pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia is further complicated by the fact that the severity of cell injury is modulated by numerous indirect or secondary consequences of the primary ischemic impact. Recirculation disturbances, stress responses, peroxidative changes, or the activation of genomic responses are only few examples of the large number of hemodynamic and molecular responses which determine the final outcome [153, 97]. The interpretation of experimental data of cerebral ischemia, therefore, requires intimate knowledge of the models and conditions under which the data have been collected. The number and diversity of such models, has become very large over the years because researchers have sought in vain for the ideal approach to study ischemic injury and its therapeutic reversal. Such an ideal model should be relevant to the clinical situation, it should be … \n\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +49 (221) 4726 211; Fax: +49 (221) 4726 325; E-mail: hossmann@mpin-koeln.mpg.de",

      "title": "Insomnia in peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women and in some somatic diseases",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

Convergence problems include the more commonly seen primary convergence accommodative synkenesis insufficiency and excess, but as well, result from destabilizing vergence disorders of convergence retraction nystagmus and convergence spasm. Convergence effort alone rarely can induce other forms of nystagmus at near. Saccadic dysfunction occurs in a large variety of muscular, neuromuscular and neurologic disorders. Accommodative insufficiency can result from head trauma, mononeuropathy affecting the third cranial nerve and cilliary ganglion, destructive intraocular disease as well as from systemic diseases such as botulism and diphtheria. Drugs can affect any of the near vision factors in dose related fashion. A complete history is paramount in reaching the correct diagnosis.",

Ictal semiology may vary depending on the etiology, age at onset, and cerebral areas involved in the epileptogenic network. In childhood, EE could manifest as tonic head drop seizures, generalized seizures, or late-onset epileptic spasms. However, in teenagers or adults, seizures are often preceded by aura and commonly manifest as focal seizures with or without impaired awareness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities are seen in less than half of the reported cases. Posterior or multifocal interictal discharges can be seen in patients with EE. No randomized data about treatment are available. Structural epilepsies or coexistent unprovoked seizures other than eating seizures are poor prognostic factors for pharmacological outcome.",

A classificação das Porfirias é feita de acordo com a origem dos precursores em excesso, sendo, então, Porfirias Eritropoéticas ou Hepáticas. Também podem ser classificadas em Agudas e Crônicas, de acordo com as manifestações clínicas. Assim, sintomas neuropsiquiátricos, dores abdominais, vômitos, neuropatia aguda, convulsões e distúrbios mentais como alucinações, depressão, paranoia e ansiedades são referentes ao aspecto agudo. Já em casos crônicos, a manifestação clínica se dá sob a forma de fotossensibilidade cutânea. O tratamento é realizado após a descoberta dos sintomas.

Methods of the research. The following theoretical methods of the research were used to solve the tasks formulated in the article: a categorical method, structural and functional methods, the methods of the analysis, systematization, modeling and generalization. The experimental method was the method of organizing empirical research. Also, we used the method of Positive Psychotherapy. The results of the research. We proved, that the main symptoms of PTSD syndrome of combatants because of the russian-Ukrainian war included: pathological memories (obsessive return to the war situation); sleep disturbance; inability to remember, such as amnesia for some events (avoidance of everything that reminds of combat events); excessive excitability (inadequate excessive mobilization); hypersensitivity (increased alertness to the new occurrence of extreme factors). Conclusions. We considered a type of PTSD such as military traumatic stress. In our opinion, it occurs in direct participants in hostilities. Certain conditions contribute to the formation of military traumatic stress, for example: a sharp change in the conditions of peaceful civilian life to combat conditions, to which it is necessary to adapt quickly. In such conditions, a person is constantly in danger, he/she is a witness to destruction, fires, deaths (of both acquaintances and strangers); a sharp change from the situation of hostilities to a peaceful life. A combatant has to adapt to this situation anew. The maladaptive processes that occur during this period are distinguished by their duration and are called PTSD. Returning to normal peaceful life as a result of the end of hostilities or as a result of demobilization, a person often remains adapted to the situation of hostilities.",

      "title": "The biological basis of injury and neuroprotection in the fetal and neonatal brain",
      "abstract": "Abstract A compromised intrauterine environment that delivers low levels of oxygen and/or nutrients, or is infected or inflammatory, can result in fetal brain injury, abnormal brain development and in cases of chronic compromise, intrauterine growth restriction. Preterm birth can also be associated with injury to the developing brain and affect the normal trajectory of brain growth. This review will focus on the effects that episodes of perinatal hypoxia (acute, chronic, associated with inflammation or as an antecedent of preterm birth) can have on the developing brain. In animal models of these conditions we have found that relatively brief (acute) periods of fetal hypoxemia can have significant effects on the fetal brain, for example death of susceptible neuronal populations (cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex) and cerebral white matter damage. Chronic placental insufficiency which includes fetal hypoxemia, nutrient restriction and altered endocrine status can result in fetal growth restriction and long‐term deficits in neural connectivity in addition to altered postnatal function, for example in the auditory and visual systems. Maternal/fetal inflammation can result in fetal brain damage, particularly but not exclusively in the white matter; injury is more pronounced when associated with fetal hypoxemia. In the baboon, in which the normal trajectory of growth is affected by preterm birth, there is a direct correlation between a higher flux in oxygen saturation and a greater extent of neuropathological damage. Currently, the only established therapy for neonatal encephalopathy in full term neonates is moderate hypothermia although this only offers some protection to moderately but not severely affected brains. There is no accepted therapy for injured preterm brains. Consequently the search for more efficacious treatments continues; we discuss neuroprotective agents (erythropoietin, N‐acetyl cysteine, melatonin, creatine, neurosteroids) which we have trialed in appropriate animal models. The possibility of combining hypothermia with such agents or growth factors is now being considered. A deeper understanding of causal pathways in brain injury is essential for the development of efficacious strategies for neuroprotection.",

Many classifications can be used, such as classifications related to the location of the lesion or classifications related to the clinical presentations. The latter have the advantage of enticing the practitioner to systematically evaluate specific sleep disorders. Such classifications include neurodegenerative disorders, neuromuscular disorders, movement disorders, autoimmune disorders, cerebrovascular diseases, seizures, and headaches. The manifestations in terms of their impact on sleep often depend, of course, on the location of the lesion. Some neurologic diseases involve the sleep-wake system. For example, dementing disorders may affect diffuse neural pathways that impact the strength of the circadian rhythm, but also instability of sleep and sleep states. In contrast, other disorders secondarily impact sleep and its quality. As an example, neuromuscular disorders can impact control of swallowing and the airway, which can increase susceptibility to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).",

      "title": "Insomnia – A Heterogenic Disorder Often Comorbid With Psychological and Somatic Disorders and Diseases: A Narrative Review With Focus on Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges",
      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "title": "The Role of Neuro-Immune Interaction in Chronic Pain Conditions; Functional Somatic Syndrome, Neurogenic Inflammation, and Peripheral Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "Functional somatic syndromes are increasingly diagnosed in chronically ill patients presenting with an array of symptoms not attributed to physical ailments. Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome are common disorders that belong in this broad category. Such syndromes are characterised by the presence of one or multiple chronic symptoms including widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and abdominal pain, amongst other issues. Symptoms are believed to relate to a complex interaction of biological and psychosocial factors, where a definite aetiology has not been established. Theories suggest causative pathways between the immune and nervous systems of affected individuals with several risk factors identified in patients presenting with one or more functional syndromes. Risk factors including stress and childhood trauma are now recognised as important contributors to chronic pain conditions. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse during childhood is considered a severe stressor having a high prevalence in functional somatic syndrome suffers. Such trauma permanently alters the biological stress response of the suffers leading to neuroexcitatory and other nerve issues associated with chronic pain in adults. Traumatic and chronic stress results in epigenetic changes in stress response genes, which ultimately leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system manifesting in a broad array of symptoms. Importantly, these systems are known to be dysregulated in patients suffering from functional somatic syndrome. Functional somatic syndromes are also highly prevalent co-morbidities of psychiatric conditions, mood disorders, and anxiety. Consequently, this review aims to provide insight into the role of the nervous system and immune system in chronic pain disorders associated with the musculoskeletal system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.",

      "abstract": "Memory disorder is often produced as one component of a general loss of mental ability (‘dementia’), but in some patients amnesia is a discrete disorder, leaving intact many other cognitive abilities such as reasoning, perception, and intelligence. Neuropathological analysis of the brain damage responsible for producing discrete amnesia suggests that the critical lesion for producing this disorder is any bilateral interruption of a system of interconnected structures. Evidence for other clearly defined memory systems is less solid as yet, but experimental evidence for a dissociable semantic memory system, and for perceptual learning mechanisms that operate relatively separably from episodic and semantic memory, are discussed in this chapter.",

      "title": "On the Mechanism of Mental Processes, with Special Reference to Emotional Control",
      "abstract": "Some psychiatrists attribute great importance to the neuro-insane diathesis as a factor in the causation of insanity, whilst others belittle its influence. The term is misleading, for it suggests that this diathesis is confined solely to the mentally afflicted, and, further, its precise meaning is vague. A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

Ces alterations peuvent trouver leurs origines dans des atteintes primaires de la fonction neuromusculaire et/ou des atteintes secondaires causees par exemple, par une diminution de l'activite spontanee favorisee par une pathologie chronique. Ainsi, la faiblesse et la fatigabilite musculaire sont des symptomes tres frequemment rapportes dans les maladies neuromusculaires (myopathies/neuropathies d'origine genetique ou acquise), les pathologies impliquant le systeme cardiovasculaire (insuffisance cardiaque) et/ou respiratoire (broncho-pneumopathie chronique obstructive (BPCO)). Ces symptomes sont aussi frequemment associes aux syndromes idiopathiques de douleurs chroniques accompagnees d'anomalies de la nociception (syndrome fibromyalgique). Le developpement d'outils d'evaluation bien toleres et fiables de la force, de l'endurance et de la fatigue neuromusculaire est d'une importance cruciale pour approfondir la comprehension des mecanismes physiopathologiques et pour disposer de criteres de jugement de qualite dans le cadre d'etudes observationnelles et interventionnelles. Dans ce contexte, la stimulation artificielle electrique s'est revelee etre un outil performant pour evaluer in situ la fonction musculaire chez l'humain au repos et au cours de l'exercice. Plus specifiquement, la stimulation magnetique des troncs nerveux peripheriques a montre des predispositions interessantes pour l'evaluation de la fonction des muscles locomoteurs et respiratoires dans le cadre clinique. Au cours de ce travail, nous avons developpe des outils d'evaluation de la force, de l'endurance et de la fatigue neuromusculaire en utilisant la neurostimulation magnetique et des protocoles d'exercice potentiellement applicables chez le patient. Nous avons etudie leurs capacites a detecter des differences liees au sexe, l'âge et au statut d'entrainement. Dans un second temps, nous avons applique nos evaluations dans le cadre de maladies neuromusculaires et de syndromes douloureux chroniques. Chez le patient BPCO, nous avons etudie les phenomenes de fatigue des muscles respiratoires et locomoteurs, leur impact sur la reponse a l'effort ainsi que leurs relations entre eux et avec les symptomes percus. Chez ces patients, nous avons recherche les effets d'un entraiment d'une prise en charge combinant un entrainement des muscles locomoteurs et un entrainement des muscles respiratoires sur ces parametres.",

Sie sind charakterisiert durch Symptome wie Oberbauchschmerzen, Vollegefuhl etc. sowie durch das Fehlen struktureller Lasionen oder biochemischer Abnormalitaten, die diese Symptome erklaren. Die funktionelle Dyspepsie mit auf den Oberbauch bezogenen chronischen oder chronisch rezidivierenden Symptomen ist dabei eine der wichtigsten Erkrankungen, die in der Klinik Anlass gibt fur endoskopische Untersuchungen.\r\nHinsichtlich der Pathogenese der Symptome wird heute angenommen, dass neben Motilitatsstorungen vor allem Veranderungen der gastrointestinalen Sensorik eine zentrale Rolle einnehmen. So sind bei Patienten im Vergleich zu gesunden Probanden die Schwellen fur die Wahrnehmung und das Auftreten von Beschwerden bei mechanischer Distension des Magens signifikant niedriger als bei gesunden Probanden . Neben Unterschieden hinsichtlich der Wahrnehmungsschwellen sind Patienten gekennzeichnet durch gestorte adaptive Veranderungen der Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation oder einer mukosalen Schleimhautschadigung durch nicht-steroidale Antirheumatika (NSAR). Ziel der vorliegenden Untersuchung war es, den Einfluss opioiderger Bahnen fur die Modulation viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen zu erfassen und die Effekte bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie und gesunden Probanden zu vergleichen. In Ubereinstimmung mit anderen fruheren Arbeiten findet sich bei Gesunden ein Anstieg viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation und Behandlung mit NSAR, wahrend die Schwellen bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie abnehmen. Die Gabe von Naloxon, einem unspezifischen Opioidantagonisten, bewirkt bei Gesunden einen signifikant starker ausgepragten Abfall viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen als bei Patienten. Die Daten lassen insofern den Schluss zu, dass \r\na) bei Patienten offensichtlich antinozizeptive Bahnen nur eingeschrankt funktionstuchtig sind; \r\nb) b) dies auf eine Storung opioiderg vermittelter antinozizeptiver Effekte zuruckzufuhren ist, was die verminderte Antwort auf intravenos appliziertes Naloxon bei Patienten nahe legt.",

Aktivitas ini dapat bersifat parsial atau general, berasal dari daerah spesifik korteks serebri atau melibatkan kedua hemisfer otak. Kejang disebabkan oleh banyak faktor, yaitu penyakit serebrovaskuler (stroke iskemik, stroke hemoragik), gangguan neurodegeneratif, tumor, trauma kepala, gangguan metabolik, infeksi susunan saraf pusat (SSP) seperti ensefalitis, meningitis. Penyebab lain adalah gangguan tidur, stimulasi sensori atau emosi, perubahan hormon, kehamilan, penggunaan obat-obatan yang menginduksi kejang (teofilin dosis tinggi, fenotiazin dosis tinggi), antidepresan (maprotilin atau bupropion), kebiasaan minum alkohol. Berdasarkan International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) dan International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) pada tahun 1981, epilepsi adalah suatu kelainan otak yang ditandai adanya faktor predisposisi yang dapat mencetuskan bangkitan epileptik, perubahan neurologis, kognitif, psikologis dan adanya konsekuensi sosial yang diakibatkannya. Diagnosa epilepsi ditegakkan melalui anamnesa, pemeriksaan fisik dan electroencephalography (EEG). Umumnya, epilepsi diterapi dengan obat antiepilepsi atau anti konvulsan. Apabila kejang tidak teratasi dengan obat oral, dapat dilakukan terapi invasif atau pembedahan, berupa non brain epilepsy surgery atau brain epilepsy surgery. Di Inggris, diperkirakan 0,5–2% total penduduk, menderita epilepsi, dimana 13% memerlukan terapi invasif atau pembedahan. Studi retrospektif, membuktikan, pengobatan invasif atau pembedahan pada epilepsi yang tidak respons terhadap obat oral, telah berhasil mengurangi serangan kejang. Penatalaksanaan anestesi pada epilepsi merupakan tantangan tersendiri bagi dokter anestesi. Diperlukan pemilihan gas, anestetika intravena dan teknik anestesi yang tidak memicu serangan kejang selama operasi. Interaksi dan efek samping obat anti epilepsi harus diperhitungkan saat anestesi.

From a biological viewpoint, chronic fear and activation of glucocorticoids are metabolically costly. The physiological effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may elicit posttraumatic stress disorder, the physiological characteristics of which may be in the opposite direction to those of TBI. Somatic injury occurring in the concussive accident may be the most important consideration affecting status and outcome. Chronic stress impairs the process of wound healing, attributable to proinflammatory. Stress reduces the immune response, and reduces the proliferation and activity of various types of cells. Prolonged somatic activity related to injury, stress, pain; stress reactions to chronic pain and impairment; and unhappiness all result in neuroendocrine imbalances. Physiological dysfunctions contribute to neurobehavioral dysfunctioning that can be misattributed to cerebral injury, faking or secondary gain, if the practitioner does not consider the effects of an injury.",

      "title": "Functional limitations associated with mental disorders : inescapable fact or avoidable reality?",
      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

Die ganze Körpermuskulator oder auch nur einzelne Muskelgruppen können betroffen sein. Ein besonders bekanntes Beispiel ist der sog. Schiefhals (Tortikollis). Andere Sonderformen sind Blephrospasmus (unwillkürliches Lidzusammenkneifen), der vorwiegend im höheren Lebensalter auftritt, kraniale Dystonie (Grimassieren), spasmodische Dysphonie (gepreßtes heiseres Sprechen) und der sog. Schreibkrampf. Die Bewegungsstörung kann so bizarre Ausmaße annehmen, daß die Umwelt oder auch die behandelnden ärzte sie mit seelisch bedingten Bewegungsstörungen verwechseln können. Dies hängt auch damit zusammen, daß unter Aufregung oder Streß in beiden Fällen das Ausmaß der Bewegungsstörung zunehmen kann.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The family of disorders known as dementias derive their name from the most conspicuous set of symptoms with which they are associated; that is, deficits in mentation. Such deficits are secondary to a number of pathophysiological processes like infections, metabolic deficiencies, autoimmune diseases, toxic encephalopathies, hypothyroidism, trauma, and hydrocephalus, among others. However, these secondary deficits are either reversible or, generally, not progressive. In the case of the dementias, on the other hand, the same deficits are not just irreversible but, with the exception of vascular dementia, worsen and progress over time, following the rhythm of the underlying pathophysiology.",

      "abstract": "Subcortical dementia is a clinical syndrome incorporating disorders of cognitive and affective sphere, which is caused by organic damage to subcortical structures. The syndrome is usually connected with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Huntington Disease, Parkinson's Disease. Subcortical dementia is mainly characterized by: slowing down of psychic functions and impairment of their precision, disorders in the ability to use achieved knowledge and personality changes. Most authors stress the fact that similar cognitive and emotional personality defects are observed in cases of frontal cortex damage. Recent research points to the existence of functional subcortical-prefrontal circuits which regulate human behaviour. There is a link between subcortical dementia and functional or structural break of one or more cortical-subcortical connections. Attention is also called to disorders in certain neurotransmitting systems (dopaminergic, acetylcholinergic) as well as to brain hypometabolism in basal ganglia, thalamus and prefrontal cortex.",

      "title": "Effects of behavioural traits and the endogenous opioid system in neuropathic pain manifestations",
      "abstract": "Introduccion El dolor neuropatico es definido como el dolor que es iniciado o causado por una lesion o disfuncion primaria en el sistema nervioso (Merskey and Bogduk, 1994). El dolor cronico es un trastorno complejo que incluye manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas que muestran una alta variabilidad interindividual dependiente de multiples factores, incluyendo los rasgos de personalidad de los pacientes (Asghari and Nicholas, 2006; La Porta et al., 2016). Dentro de las manifestaciones nociceptivas, el dolor neuropatico, se desarrollan signos sensoriales anormales como dolor espontaneo, alodinia e hiperalgesia (Bridges et al., 2001). El dolor neuropatico esta frecuentemente asociado con desordenes afectivos como ansiedad y depresion. Tambien se ha establecido una relacion entre el dolor y deficits cognitivos como el problemas de memoria y aprendizaje (Kodama et al., 2011; Low et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2011). El sistema opioide endogeno esta altamente relacionado con la modulacion de las funciones fisiologicas que son afectadas por el dolor neuropatico, ademas de su mas conocida funcion que es la induccion de analgesia endogena (Le Merrer et al., 2009).\nObjetivos Los objetivos de este trabajo fueron: validar en ratones, diferentes paradigmas conductuales para medir las manifestaciones emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico inducido por la ligadura parcial del nervio ciatico; evaluar la influencia de rasgos conductuales especificos sobre las manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico y explorar la influencia de las preproencefalinas en las manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico.\nMetodos y Resultados Primero, modelos clasicos de comportamiento fueron validados para evaluar las manifestaciones emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico. Despues, evaluamos la influencia de los rasgos especificos de comportamiento, asi como el papel de la preproencefalinas (Penk) en las manifestaciones del dolor neuropatico inducido por ligadura parcial del nervio ciatico en ratones. Se observo que era posible detectar las manifestaciones del dolor neuropatico dependientes del tiempo a traves de paradigmas clasicos utilizados para evaluar comportamientos como la ansiedad, la depresion y la funcion cognitiva. Se identificaron los genes Pdyn y Gadd45 en amigdala como biomarcadores de la influencia de los rasgos de ansiedad y depresion en las manifestaciones del dolor neuropatico. La delecion de Penk produjo un efecto techo en el desarrollo de ansiedad y deficits cognitivos producidos por el dolor neuropatico. Este efecto techo se relaciono con el mantenimiento de la expresion de Pdyn, KOR, Npas4 y Nr3c1 en la amigdala y con la disminucion en la expresion de Nr3c1 en el hipocampo, respectivamente. \nConclusiones En la presente tesis, a traves de paradigmas clasicos de comportamiento, se detecto la influencia de rasgos especificos de comportamiento y el papel de las preproencefalinas en las manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas asociadas a dolor neuropatico. Estas manifestaciones fueron sensibles principalmente a la ansiedad y depresion. Finalmente, se identifico la preproencefalina como un componente esencial para el desarrollo de los cambios fisiologicos y comportamentales inducidos por el dolor neuropatico. \nReferencias Asghari, A., Nicholas, M.K.

They do not perform differential diagnostic management, what leads to issuing erroneous opinions. The aim of this report is to show the symptoms of posttraumatic cerebrasthenia and posttraumatic encephalopathy and diagnostic investigations, which could be helpful for diagnosing these conditions. Cerebrasthenia (the subjective posttraumatic syndrome, subjective syndrome, posttraumatic neurosis) is usually a functional--unorganic disorder. It happens in the cases of many people who had brain concussion. The most common symptoms are: headache, vertigo, irritability, insomnia, attention deficits, fatigability. Posttraumatic encephalopathy is a persistent brain tissues injury which could be caused by more severe trauma (brain contusion, endocranial bleeding). The clinical picture of this disease entity is not unambiguous. The most frequently encountered form is a simple (common) form, which is similar to cerebrasthenia, but with differences in the neurological examination (focal signs) and with persistent changes in EEG.",

The non-genetic or sporadic ataxias are frequently related to autoimmune disorders.2 However, cerebellar ataxia is rarely described in Sjogren’s syndrome. It is mandatory to classify ataxia as related to cerebellar damage (cerebellar ataxia) or to peripheral neuropathy (sensory ataxia). Usually, patients with Sjogren’s syndrome may present with sensory ataxia related to a sensory neuronopathy.2 \n\nThis study aimed to characterise the pattern of ataxia in Sjogren’s syndrome and also to describe cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar atrophy in some of these patients.\n\nFourteen patients with confirmed Sjogren’s syndrome and ataxia were enrolled on this study.

      "title": "New symptoms in a patient with diagnosed porphyria – untypical clinical course or another disease? Extended differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Acute liver porphyrias are caused by mutations of genes encoding the heme biosynthesis enzymes. A lack of any of these enzymes leads to a decrease in the heme level, which in each case is manifested by identical clinical symptoms. Nervous tissue is particularly susceptible to a depletion of heme levels. Three classical symptoms of a porphyria attack include: abdominal pain (as a manifestation of autonomic neuropathy), peripheral neuropathy, and psychic disturbances. Apart from the main symptoms, porphyria attacks may be manifested as various neurological disturbances, such as: bulbar palsy, epileptic seizures, psychic disturbances and focal symptoms of CNS damage. The intensity of individual symptoms can vary. Although neurological symptoms usually disappear after the attack, they may cause permanent deficits. Through involving CNS, porphyria can mimic other neurological disorders. Damage to the nervous system can be confirmed by additional examinations. Thus far, disseminated focal changes during the attack, which disappear after the regression of clinical symptoms, have been described in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Spinal cord abnormalities in MRI scans have not been described yet, despite the fact that damage to the anterior horn associated with porphyria has been confirmed in literature. While examining cerebrospinal fluid during the attack, an elevated protein level has been noticed, so far without the presence of oligoclonal bands. This paper aimed to demonstrate that porphyria should be considered in differential diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). This paper is based on the case of a symptomatic patient who carried a mutation in one of the genes for porphyria, and who developed a clinical manifestation of focal damage to CNS. A differential diagnosis of porphyria and CIS, with a subsequent conversion to a clinically defined MS, was carried out. The results of additional examinations performed routinely in both disorders, the clinical picture and data from medical literature have been used in the analysis of this case. The authors present the case of a patient with confirmed genetic porphyria, who was hospitalized for purposes of establishing a diagnosis due to weakened lower extremities. The patient manifested spastic lower extremity paresis, sensation disorders and urinary incontinence, which indicated spinal cord damages. An MRI scan of the thoracic spine revealed disseminated foci with contrast enhancement. A high level of proteins and oligoclonal bands were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. On the basis of a new clinical picture (differing from the previous attack symptoms), prolonged symptoms, spinal cord lesions in MRI, and the presence of oligoclonal bands, CIS was diagnosed. Quick and complete recovery was obtained due to the administering of a steroid therapy. After several months, the patient reported a similar, passing episode, which, according to the authors, confirmed the diagnosis and an expected conversion to a clinically defined MS. Taking into consideration the clinical manifestation of spinal cord involvement untypical of porphyria, the detection of spinal lesions in an MRI scan, the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid and the positive effect of steroid therapy, the authors believe that this described patient, who was a symptomatic carrier of a mutation in a gene for porphyria, developed CIS. This reported case, supported by data from medical literature, shows that porphyria should be taken into consideration in any differential diagnosis of CIS and MS.",

Due to the specific features of the anatomy of cerebral circulation, hypertensive microangiopathy leads primarily to damage to the subcortical basal ganglia and deep white matter. Clinically, this is manifested by a concurrence of predominantly subcortical cognitive impairment and emotional and behavioral disorders as depression, emotional lability, and apathy. Some features of depression, such as the prevalence of anhedonia and fatigue and the significant severity of cognitive and somatic symptoms in an elderly person with vascular disease, suggest its organic nature (vascular depression).",

      "title": "Excited delirium syndrome",
      "abstract": "Mental health calls make up a large proportion of ambulance workloads, with paramedics responding to a wide range of presentations such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and excited delirium syndrome. Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

Major depressive disorder may be the primary diagnosis, the patient having been unaware of depressed affect until anxiety became less prominent. Depression may also be a comorbid condition, appearing because anxiety lowers the threshold for its development or as a result of use of central nervous system depressants or intercurrent medical illnesses. Depression may also be a response to psychosocial consequences of anxiety or its resolution. In some anxious patients, depression is a later stage in the development of a dysregulated stress response. Initial treatment of depression involves therapy for organic causative factors and psychosocial problems. Medications that may be useful for both depression and anxiety include cyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and possibly azapirones and benzodiazepines. Combined anxiolytic-antidepressant treatment may be necessary for some patients.",

Such acts persisted for 2 to l0 minutes despite forceful external interruption in three single, white male loners. In contrast, five nonusers, with otherwise similar symptomatology, aborted their homicidal attacks on external interruption, in a previously proposed syndrome with only experiential kindling with memory revival of past hurts in limbic psychotic trigger reaction. Thus, this article hypothesizes that either chemical kindling alone or as a superimposition on experiential kindling might occur in the form of unusual persistence or enhancement of partial seizures.",

      "title": "The enigma of central sensitivity syndrome in dentistry",
      "abstract": "Central sensitivity syndrome was coined to replace the previously commonly used term of functional somatic syndromes to describe medically unexplained symptoms and conditions that are typically associated with psychological distress. A lack of understanding of pain biology has led to many individuals being inappropriately labeled as having a “psychosomatic” or “functional” condition, implying a psychogenic origin for their complaint. With advances in our understanding of the science of “suffering,” it is now apparent that a distressing experience such as pain is not merely a sensation that is proportional to the level of nociceptive input, but rather an unpleasant experience influenced by emotional, cognitive, and social components.[1] Dentists, and in particular oral medicine specialists, will face the enigma of central sensitivity syndrome, whereby a distressed and desperate patient may present for diagnosis and treatment for his or her complex orofacial complaint. Orofacial diseases and disorders commonly associated with central sensitivity syndrome include chronic myofascial pain, persistent idiopathic facial pain (atypical facial pain), persistent dentoalveolar pain (atypical odontalgia), burning mouth syndrome (oral dysesthesia), occlusal dysesthesia, and halitophobia. An understanding of central sensitivity syndrome will better prepare dentists to be able to manage these complex cases. Central sensitivity syndrome is best explained within a biopsychosocial context and with concepts of peripheral and central sensitization. In addition, studies have found detectable neurobiological, immune system and neuroendocrine axis changes that explain central sensitivity syndrome.[2] A number of factors are believed to predispose an individual to central sensitivity syndrome, and these include endocrine and neuroendocrine dysfunction, altered autonomic nervous system function, persistent inflammatory or degenerative disorders (nociception), viral illnesses, sleep disturbances, psychosocial distress and stressors including childhood trauma, small-fiber neuropathies, environmental factors such as weather, noise, and chemicals, and medications such as opioids.[3] To use a classic clinical example to illustrate central sensitivity syndrome, a patient may present with the complaint of a hot, burning mouth, however complicated by generalized hypersensitivity to noxious and non-noxious stimuli, sleep disturbances, chronic fatigue, and psychosocial distress.[4] A review of their medical history may highlight the typical conditions associated with central sensitivity syndrome such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, tension-type headache, chronic pelvis pain, interstitial cystitis, and vulvodynia.[5] In such a case, a holistic approach beyond the primary complaint of burning mouth is necessary. To manage patients who present with central sensitivity syndrome, the clinician must be trained to attain a thorough psychosocial history. This should include questions regarding the initiating, perpetuating, and predisposing factors for the complaint. For example, a patient diagnosed with burning mouth syndrome may report the onset of the burning sensation to coincide with the stress of a motor vehicle accident (initiating factor). However, with further questioning, it is deciphered that the patient has severe depression, history of panic attacks, and obsessive-compulsive tendencies that are likely perpetuating the condition (perpetuating factors). With good clinician–patient rapport, it becomes apparent that the patient has a long history of psychosocial distress that dates back to being sexually abused as a child (predisposing factor). Therefore, for a clinician to successfully treat a patient with central sensitivity syndrome, treatment must also be targeted toward psychosocial factors that may be contributing to the complaint. This must include questions on the behavioral aspects such as sleep disturbances and diet (caffeine, alcohol, drugs), the social aspects such as the effects of the pain on daily function, presence of support systems and dependencies, stigma and access to medical care, and the emotional aspects such as depression, anxiety, symptom reporting, catastrophizing, and fear avoidance. Currently, dental students are trained to manage dental disease based on a cause-and-effect model with little discussion regarding psychosocial factors. Hence, the time has come for a shift in the paradigm in this education model, so patients with central sensitivity syndrome may be diagnosed and treated appropriately.",

The cholinergic system, particularly projections from the basal forebrain to hippocampus and cortex, is accountable for memory and learning. The etiological factors of AD are not clearly known, and it is probably the result of a multifactorial process including head trauma, oxidative stress, genetics, infectious agents, and environmental factors including Al toxicity.

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "abstract": "The present review aims to highlight this intricate syndrome, regarding diagnosis, pathophysiology, etiology, prevention and management in elderly people. The diagnosis of delirium is based on clinical observations, cognitive assessment, detailed family history, physical and neurological examination. Clinically, delirium occurs in hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed forms, based on psychomotor behaviour. As an acute confusional state, it is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms, fluctuating course and an altered level of consciousness, global disturbance of cognition or perceptual abnormalities and evidence of a physical cause. In spite of pathophysiological mechanisms of delirium remaining unclear, current evidence suggests that disruption of neurotransmission, inflammation or acute stress responses might all contribute to the development of this ailment. It usually occurs as a result of a complex interaction of multiple risk factors, such as cognitive impairment/dementia, current hip fracture and presence of severe illness. Despite all of the above, delirium is frequently under-recognized and often misdiagnosed by health professionals. In particular, this happens due to its fluctuating nature, its overlap with dementia and the scarcity of routine formal cognitive assessment in general hospitals. It is also associated with multiple adverse outcomes that have been well documented, such as increased hospital stay, function/cognitive decline, institutionalization and mortality. In this context, early identification of delirium will be essential. Timely and optimal management of people with delirium, should be performed with identification of possible underlying causes, dealing with a suitable care environment and improving education of health professionals. All these can be important factors, which contribute to a decrease in adverse outcomes associated with delirium.",

Somatoform complaints (e.g. headache with 38.7%) or non-specific common symptoms (e.g. feeling of inner restlessness with 41.3%) are much more widespread. Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

      "title": "Hipoglikemijski sindromi - dijagnostički i terapijski pristup i prikaz dva slučaja",
      "abstract": "Prevention of hypoglycemia is essential for preservation of brain metabolism and survival of the whole body. Normally, glucose is only substrate used by the brain to meet its metabolic requirements. When plasma glucose concentration decreases (e.g., during prolonged fasting or after administration of glucose-lowering drugs) several physiological responses are activated to prevent further decreases in blood glucose. The first response is known as counterregulation, a system that prevents and corrects hypoglycemia through the release of counterregulatory hormones. Ultimately traceable to neural glucose deprivation, symptoms of hypoglycemia include neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Neurogenic symptoms (tremulousness, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias) are results of the perception of physiologic changes caused by the autonomic nervous system’s response to hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, sensation of warmth, weakness or fatigue, severe cognitive failure, seizure, coma) are the results of brain glucose deprivation itself. Glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations following recent episodes of hypoglycemia, leading to the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness-loss of warming symptoms of developing hypoglycemia. Thus, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia (e.g. those with tightly controlled diabetes or with an insulinoma) often tolerate abnormal low plasma glucose concentration without symptoms. Classification of symptoms of hypoglycemia, namely reactive versus fasting based on segregation by timing in relation to meals is no longer useful from a clinical point of view. Every patient with neuroglycopenic symptoms regardless of relation to food ingestion, requires comprehensive evaluation. Identification of the possible cause of hypoglycemia and selection of diagnostic modalities are facilitated by considering whether the patients appears to be healthy (with or without compensated coexistent disease) or ill (with a disease known to have a proclivity to develop hypoglycemia, or is hospitalized). Medications may mediate hypoglycemia in anybody, whether they appear healthy or ill. Optimal condition for confirming the presence and accurately diagnosing the type of hypoglycemic disorder occurs at the time of spontaneous spell. Otherwise, dynamic testing to generate conductive conditions should be conducted in any patients with a history of neuroglycopenic symptoms, regardless of relation to meal ingestion. Specific criteria regarding beta-cell polypeptide concentrations are required to establish hyperinsulinemia. Sulfonylureas in plasma should be measured with sensitive assays. Surgical management of insulinoma begins with simply considering the diagnosis then proceeding to establish absolutely the biochemical diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "The evidence linking delirium to poor outcomes after critical illness is compelling, including higher mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer length of intensive care unit stay, and long-term cognitive impairments. The attitude toward delirium in the neurologic community is shifting away from viewing it as an unmodifiable, inevitable consequence of severe illness to treating it is as a neurologic emergency, akin to seizures or encephalitis. Delirium, like other manifestations of critical illness encephalopathy, is an organ dysfunction syndrome. Given the brain's central role in maintaining homeostasis, brain failure may dysregulate many downstream functions of significant consequence in critically ill patients. The diagnosis of delirium may be confounded in patients with primary brain disorders, but nevertheless delirium symptoms in the neurologic population are also independently associated with worse outcomes. There is scant evidence for directed pharmacological treatment of delirium, but multicomponent care bundles that address the management of pain, agitation, sedation, and delirium are effective at reducing the burden of delirium in the general intensive care unit population. The management of delirium in the neurologic intensive care environment is mostly extrapolated from studies on general medical critical illness and noncritically ill neurologic patients. Further investigation into the unique risks and management needs of critically ill neurologic and neurosurgical patients is needed to reduce the burden of delirium in that population.",

      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity.

Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

      "title": "Convulsants",
      "abstract": "Abstract Convulsants are substances that induce seizure‐like paroxysmal behaviors by producing patterns of electrical activity in the brain that resemble those seen in human epilepsy. Epilepsy is characterized by recurring episodes in which the electrical activity of many thousands of neurons becomes abnormally elevated and pathologically synchronized. This discharge interrupts normal brain function and leads, in some forms of epilepsy, to alterations in behavior (seizures). Seizures come in many varieties, ranging from brief, barely detectable losses of consciousness in what are called absence or petit mal epilepsies , to uncontrollable tonic‐clonic contractions of large muscle groups in the so‐called grand mal epilepsies . The behavioral manifestations and severity of the seizure reflect primarily the size and localization of the abnormal electrical discharge.",

      "abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting multiple organ systems. 30-40 % of the patients manifest variable neuropsychiatric symptoms leading to significant morbidity and mortality. CNS involvement could be primary if directly related to SLE activity in the CNS or secondary to treatment, infections, metabolic abnormalities or other systemic manifestations such as hypertension (Futrell et al,1992). Primary NPSLE is divided into focal and diffuse disease. Focal NPSLE is characterized by focal neurologic deficits and is strongly associated with the occurrence of thromboembolic events. Diffuse primary NPSLE is a group of neurologic, psychiatric, and cognitive syndromes that vary from overt neurologic and psychiatric symptoms (eg. seizures, psychosis) to more subtle signs such as headache, mood disturbances, anxiety disorders or mild cognitive dysfunction. Neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE) manifestations can occur in the absence of either serologic activity or other systemic disease manifestations (Sibbit et al., 1999). Thus, in clinical practice the diagnosis of primary NPSLE is rather presumptive, after the exclusion of alternative causes of the neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is no single diagnostic test that is sensitive and specific for SLE-related neuropsychiatric manifestations. The assessment of individual patients is based on clinical, neurologic and rheumatologic evaluation, immunoserologic testing, brain imaging, and psychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. These examinations are used to support or refute the clinical diagnostic impression, rule out alternative explanations, and form the basis for prospective monitoring of clinical evolution and response to treatment interventions. The lack of a diagnostic gold standard makes the correct diagnosis of primary NPSLE a challenge. This realization has led us in developing under the auspices of the European League Against Rheumatology (EULAR) evidence and expert based recommendations for the management of NPSLE (Bertsias et al, 2010).",

Regardless of sensory modality, disorders of the special senses in the elderly can be conveniently divided into conductive, sensorineural, and central disorders. Disorders of the chemosensory senses, smell and taste, are usually less disabling than disorders of the other special senses (vision and hearing). Nevertheless, olfactory impairment is a significant contributor to perceived disability and lower quality of life among elderly patients and is a significant predictor of subsequent cognitive decline. Gustatory disorders in the elderly that are not secondary to olfactory disorders should prompt consideration of systemic factors, such as medication use, toxin exposures and autoimmune disorders.",

Complaints made the patient speak more difficult, slow and unable to form sentences. Physical examination show parese CN. VII UMN dextra. Siriraj score -5 and Head NCCT show cerebral infarction in the internal capsula interna. Patient was diagnosed with ischemic stroke. Discussion: The use of a scoring system can be useful when there are no brain imaging facilities that can clearly distinguish the causative pathology of stroke. criteria for diagnosis of ischemic stroke are symptoms of global neurological deficits or one / several focal neurological deficits that occur suddenly with evidence of brain imaging images (CT scan or MRI). The most common differential diagnosis is hemorrhagic stroke. Conclusion. Early recognition and appropriate treatment is important to cure acute ischemic stroke to achieve good quality of life and prevent further infarct to brain tissue.

Este deterioro está presente en un 40 a 65% de los pacientes y afecta la velocidad de procesamiento de información, atención compleja, memoria de trabajo, memoria visual y verbal, fluencia verbal y funciones ejecutivas. Se puede presentar en el síndrome radiológico aislado, en el síndrome clínico aislado y en las diferentes fases de la enfermedad; además, es el responsable de la dependencia de algunos pacientes y de las dificultades para mantener o conseguir empleo. Este déficit cognitivo se asocia a atrofia del tálamo y se ha observado una correlación con las medidas de atrofia y con el volumen lesional cerebral. Existen diferentes herramientas para su evaluación; hay pruebas de cribado breves de 5 minutos de duración, hasta baterías extensas de 90 minutos. Respecto al tratamiento de las alteraciones cognitivas, no existe un tratamiento farmacológico específico; sin embargo, se considera que los fármacos modificadores de la enfermedad podrían tener una influencia favorable en la función cognitiva por sus efectos en la reducción de la actividad inflamatoria y la atrofia cerebral.

      "abstract": "Ischemic Injury is characterized by diminished/absent blood flow in the brain. There are numerous factors and molecular cascades that are linked with pathological hallmarks of Ischemic Injury. There is a neurotransmission imbalance after the injury. Numerous neurotransmissions regulate the essential signaling for normal physiology and the working of the brain. After the injury, there is impairment in the balance of major neurotransmitters, i.e., Glu, which shows expression which leads to neuronal excitotoxicity compromising the normal physiology. GABA is reversely related to Glu, post-injury the reduced level of GABA contributes to neuronal excitability and neuronal death. Monoamines are responsible for the happiness, mood swings and the movement of the individual, post-injury creates a deficit in the level of the monoamine which could generate the state of altered mood, movement impairment, mood swings, etc. The cognitive impairment is observed after the brain insult which could be correlated with the level of Ach. AChE activity is increased in the ischemic patients which decreases the ACh level which could be correlated with the memory impairment. These neurotransmission imbalances could be beneficial to target pathological alterations and may give new insight to find novel treatments to manage associated complications.",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue.

      "title": "Management of blackouts and misdiagnosis of epilepsy and falls",
      "abstract": "‘Collapse?cause’ is a colloquial term that is widely used, especially in acute and emergency medical practice in the UK. Patients with ‘collapse?cause’ can be defined as having suffered ‘a physical collapse due to an abrupt loss of postural tone’. There may or may not have been accompanying loss of consciousness. Some patients with ‘collapse?cause’ will have suffered a stroke, others may have an acute metabolic disorder, such as hypoglycaemia, and others may have collapsed due to the effects of drugs. However, very many such patients with collapse will have suffered a ‘blackout’ (ie transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC)), with consequent collapse. It is these patients who most frequently present a diagnostic problem, since there will often be no symptoms, signs or laboratory findings of stroke, metabolic disorder or drug effect; they may have completely recovered upon admission; all the admitting doctor has to rely on is a second-hand ‘word-ofmouth’ description of the features of the blackout and collapse from bystanders, who are usually lay observers. It seems to be commonly assumed that T-LOC represents a primary neurological disturbance, and the differential diagnosis often focuses on epilepsy versus syncope. It is poorly understood that syncope is quite often convulsive, and may feature limb twitching and sometimes urinary incontinence. Syncope, defined ‘as transient loss of consciousness due to global impairment of cerebral perfusion’, 1 is very common, with up to 50% of the population having syncope at some stage in life. Syncope is the sixth most common cause of emergency admission in the UK, 2 accounting for 3% of all attendances to the emergency departments and 1% of all hospital admissions. In contrast, epilepsy affects about 0.5‐1% of the population. 3 Syncope is probably far more common than epilepsy, but this seems to go unrecognised. As a consequence, the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is very common, with 20‐30% of adults misdiagnosed with epilepsy, and a greater percentage of children. 3 The misdiagnosis of epilepsy is thought to cost the NHS about £200m per annum, and recent settlements for compensation in misdiagnosed and mistreated cases will further add to this cost. Misdiagnosis has been a feature in children, 4 but a major problem also exists with misdiagnosis in older patients.",

      "abstract": "One may look at psychosomatic medicine from three different views. The first is that in which signs and symptoms in somatic organs are seen to accompany specific mental disease, such as dementia precox. This relationship is well known and accepted. An illustration is the depressed phase of manic depressive psychosis which is frequently accompanied by periodic tachycardia, amenorrhea or loss of weight. The second aspect of psychosomatic medicine suggests that specific somatic diseases are influenced by mental states. Thus, peptic ulcer is aggravated when the patient is distressed or under tension and apt to be improved during periods of physical and emotional relaxation. The third consideration is the one that is least established, but nevertheless the most discussed recently. This maintains that repeated emotional or psychologic stress may actually produce certain somatic diseases, such as asthma, essential hypertension or eczematoid dermatitis. The present discussion will concern itself with only the",

      "abstract": "Summary Autoimmune disorders in children and adolescents can have significant neuropsychiatric complications and there is growing interest in the association between autoimmune conditions and psychiatric syndromes, particularly in Down syndrome. Acute presentations with psychiatric symptoms require careful assessment in order to recognise and plan treatment of underlying autoimmune disease in collaboration with paediatric colleagues. Difficult treatment decisions arise in children with established autoimmune diagnoses and psychiatric symptoms that may be a result of neuroimmunological processes associated with their condition, psychiatric side-effects of drug treatments or psychopathology resulting from other factors in the history that may or may not have a direct relation to the autoimmune diagnosis. This article illustrates these complexities through discussion of specific autoimmune disorders and three case histories.",

Depression occurs in up to half of all stroke patients and is most frequently associated with left anterior cortical and subcortical infarctions. Mood changes interfere with cognitive, functional and social recovery. Treatment with heterocyclic antidepressants, stimulants, and electroconvulsive therapy is efficacious in most patients. Mania, delusions, hallucinations, personality alterations, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and changes in sexual behavior are less common but have also been described in post-stroke patients. Each behavioral syndrome is associated with a specific pattern of brain involvement. Investigation of these phenomena contributes to understanding the cerebral basis of psychiatric disorders.",

Often described as tiredness, exhaustion, or lack of sleep, fatigue can progressively interfere with a patient’s physical and social activities, resulting in increased withdrawal. Fatigue is a symptom that possibly has the greatest potential to interfere with quality of life at the end of life. It has been reported to be the most common symptom that is linked to the clinical course of cancer and other chronic diseases. This chapter reviews factors associated with fatigue, components of a comprehensive assessment, and both pharmacologic (such as psychostimulants and corticosteroids) and nonpharmacologic strategies to address this distressing symptom.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It is suggested that psychotherapeutic treatment during pregnancy can help a disturbed woman achieve better integration of internal resources and self-representations, thereby preventing postnatal maternal distress. The need for psychotherapeutic intervention related to childbearing is discussed and some special features of psychotherapy with pregnant women are described, including common phase-related themes, unusual therapeutic structure, transference/counter-transference issues for both individual and group work. Key therapeutic situations are indicated by delineating three somewhat overlapping subgroups of women, who may be particularly at risk during pregnancy due to factors in their current or past experience which constitute stressors when interacting with resensitized areas of intrapsychic vulnerability. Risk-indicators specified are: Conflicted pregnancies - including unplanned, untimely and 'wrong' (such as those resulting from incest or rape). Emotional sensitization - expectant mothers who for a variety of predisposing reasons (own or maternal obstetric history, previous stillbirth or neonatal loss) or neurotic disorders, are prone to emotional difficulties such as over-or undervaluation of foetus/baby, pregnancy and/or birth. Complicated pregnancies - examining some of the possible concurrent physical conditions (maternal illness, substance abuse or eating disorders, AIDS-imperilled babies, threatened miscarriage or maternal disability), life-events (bereavement, eviction, negative test results), socioeconomic difficulties (unemployment, housing problems, poor social support), emotionally impoverished marital relationship and unsupported women on their own.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

This narrows our limits very much, but at the same time makes the problem more precise.

      "title": "[Cognitive and behavioral consequences of epilepsy during the course of brain development].",
      "abstract": "The notion that cognitive and behavioural dysfunctions of epileptic origin can be prolonged and with an insidious onset, has meant a radical conceptual change about epilepsy considered so far uniquely as a paroxysmal disorder. Also, these dysfunctions can be the only observable manifestations of the disorder. It is particularly true in some epileptic syndromes with onset in childhood. Epileptic dysfunctions are characterized by a discontinuity in time (intermittent, recurrent), in space (cerebral localization of the dysfunction and its spread). They often have a significant relationship with sleep. These features, with sometimes the existential dimension of some symptoms (intermittent loss of the flux of consciousness, intermittent perceptual distortions or cognitive-emotional dysfunction) are not seen in any other congenital or acquired disorders of the human brain. Longitudinal clinical studies in which the epileptic variable can be directly correlated with the precise study of the cognitive dysfunction (also with increasingly complex methods of brain imaging) are a difficult, relatively new multidisciplinary task, especially in the very young child. Case examples of children followed from early childhood to adulthood will illustrate the diversity of observed cognitive and behavioural abnormalities directly caused by the epileptic activity which can be massive or very discrete. One is only beginning to document precisely the late consequences (or absence of) of some early childhood epilepsies that had a direct impact on developing brain function at some point.",

      "abstract": "Postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction are common manifestations of acute brain dysfunction,occurring in up to 70% of post- surgical patients. The development of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction have long- term consequences,such as higher morbidity and mortality and increased hospital stay,and it increases the risk of dependency and institutionalisation. Delirium presents clinically with differing subtypes ranging from hyperactive to hypoactive. Despite the relevance of these cognitive disorders,the specific aetiology is still unknown,and there are many factors that have been associated with its development. In many forms of delirium,the brain's reaction to a peripheral inflammatory process is considered to be a pathophysiological key element and the aged brain seems to react more markedly to a peripheral inflammatory stimulus than a younger brain. The risk factors for delirium are categorised as predisposing or precipitating factors. In the presence of many predisposing factors,well documented predisposing factors are age,medical comorbidities,cognitive,functional,visual and hearing impairment and institutional residence. Important precipitating factors apart from surgery are admission to an ICU,anticholinergic drugs,alcohol or drug withdrawal,infections,iatrogenic complications,metabolic derangements,pain and the exposure to analgesics( opioids) and hypnotics( benzodiazepines). Several bedside instruments are available for the routine ward and ICU setting. The Confusion Assessment Method( CAM) and a version specifically developed for the intensive care setting( CAM- ICU) have emerged as a standard.Non- pharmacological multicomponent strategies and pharmacological prophylaxis may be useful to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium. Perioperative administration of haloperidol has been shown to reduce the severity and the incidence of delirium. The multicomponent interventions for prevention and treatment have been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of episodes.",

Depression is common and serious problem that often starts in childhood. Today is estimated that approximatly 10-15% of children in general population has syptoms of depression. It is associated with an increased risk of other psychiatric disorders, poor academic success, underdeveloped social skills and even suicidal thoughts. The primary symptoms of depression are continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness and mood changes. Symptoms of depression in children also include irritability or anger, social withdrawal, changes in appetite (either increased or decreased), changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep), difficulty concentrating, etc. Depressive disorders include Major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder, indeterminate and bipolar disorder. Depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Depression should be recognized and diagnosed as early as possible in children and adolescents in order to start treatment on time. The most efficient treatment is a treatment that is not focused on depressive symptoms only, but also on functioning on daily bases in children.",

      "abstract": "New-onset vertigo, dizziness and gait imbalance are amongst the most common symptoms presenting to the emergency department, accounting for 2.1-4.4% of all patients. The broad spectrum of underlying causes in these patients cuts across many specialties, which often results in diagnostic challenges. For patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for acute vestibular syndrome (AVS, i.e., presenting with acute-onset prolonged vertigo/dizziness with accompanying gait imbalance, motion intolerance, nausea/vomiting, with or without nystagmus), the typical differential diagnosis is vertebrobasilar stroke and acute unilateral vestibulopathy. However, other disorders may also present with AVS. These include non-neurological causes such as drug side-effects or intoxication, electrolyte disturbances, cardiac disease, severe anemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, endocrine disorders and others. Other non-stroke neurological disorders may also present with AVS or episodic vertigo/dizziness, including demyelinating CNS diseases, posterior fossa mass lesions, acute thiamine deficiency and vestibular migraine. Furthermore, acute physiological abnormalities (e.g., hypotension, fever, severe anemia) may unmask previous vestibular impairments that had been well-compensated. Here, we review the diagnostic approach to patients with acute-onset dizziness in the emergency room and discuss the most important differential diagnoses beyond stroke and acute unilateral vestibulopathy.",

On detailed inquiry, she was also found to have reduced attention, concentration, and short-term memory disturbances, with no focal neurological deficit on examination. Imaging with magnetic resonance imaging brain revealed a bilateral thalamic low-grade astrocytoma. This case demonstrates that a careful understanding of the apathy and cognitive dysfunction in the presence of depression/anxiety is consequential. In this case, there is more to the clinical presentation of the symptoms of depression and anxiety than meets the eye.

      "abstract": "Patients with disorders of mood or affect make up a numerically very important part of the psychiatrically ill. To facilitate references to cause, outcome, and results of treatment in clinical situations, a number of classifications of the affective disorders have been proposed. The bases of these classifications are most varied, involving consideration of the extent and nature of the psychopathology present (for example, neurotic versus psychotic depression, agitated depression, retarded depression, smiling depression, hypochrondriacal depression); longitudinal history of the patient (recording, for example, manicdepressive illness, circular type, in a person who, in the course of one or several episodes of illness, has exhibited mood swings to both the manic and the depressive poles, or endogenous-reactive depression, determined on the basis of the presence or absence of clear and meaningful precipating events); and demographic data such as age (pointing, for example, to early onset versus late onset depression, or to involutional depression in illness occurring in elderly males or in menopausal or postmenopausal females). One very important basis of classification that has been largely neglected, but that would have considerable value from an etiologic viewpoint, is a genetic one. There is considerable evidence that genetic factors are important in affective disorders. Winokur & Pitts (1965) found a greater prevalence of both affective disorder and alcoholism in parents of affectively ill patients than in parents of a control group of medical, surgical, and obstetrical patients who had been matched for age, sex, ward versus private-room status, and marital status. These results appear in Table 1, in which it can be seen that for three other psychiatric disordersneurosis, schizophrenia, and chronic brain syndromethere was no significant increase in comparison with the control figures. The finding of a greater prevalence of alcoholism in fathers of affective patients further suggests a genetic trait, according to Hanna (1965), who proposed as one criterion of a",

CP and its coexisting symptoms, encompassing mental impairment are most severe causes of handicap in children and constitute an important factor deteriorating the fulfilment of developmental tasks. the improvement of the functional status depends on systematic training based on learning processes. Following training, as effect of learning, stable plastic alterations in brain occurs, based on the previously described feature of making new synaptic connections and synaptic stabilization due to apoptosis of some other neural connections. Neverless pharmacotherapy, though it cannot remove the source of the disturbances and acts mainly symptomatically, is a important element of the complex rehabilitation. However, taking into consideration the chronic and stable character of the pathologic process, it should be remembered that the pharmacologic substances used should be characterized by: • high safety, • low toxicity, • beneficial psychotropic properties,organoleptic properties accepted by children. The most frequently used drug groups in the cerebral palsy are: • tranquilizers, • anxiolytic drugs, • neuroleptics, • antidepressive drugs, • psychoenergetizing drugs, improving the brain circulation, limiting muscular tonus, - anti-epileptic drugs. Rational use of relatively wide spectrum of drugs, relaxant, sedative, anxiolytic, toning up, improving cerebral perfusion, anticonvulsory and reducing muscle tonus makes diagnostics, functional psychotherapy, kinesis therapy, ergotherapy, manual therapy, physical therapy, as well as social and occupational rehabilitation easier to a very high extent.",

The disorders manifest in dissociative symptoms. Some are psychoform (e.g., one dissociative agent hearing another dissociative agent speak), others are somatoform, or sensory and motor (e.g., being analgesic while another dissociative agent is in pain). Somatoform and psychoform dissociative symptoms often occur together. Somatoform dissociative symptoms are characteristic of dissociative disorders and proportional to their complexity. The disorders include ICD-10's Dissociative Disorders of Movement and Sensation, inadequately renamed in ICD-11 Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder. Sensory and motor dissociative disorders are categorized in DSM-5 as Conversion Disorder. This is confusing, because the symptoms involve dissociation, not conversion of something mental into something physical. PTSD, which can be seen as a simple dissociative disorder, is associated with marked somatoform dissociation. Adverse events, particularly chronic interpersonal abuse and neglect, and the motivational conflicts this adversity typically implies, constitute an important causal factor of somatoform dissociation.",

      "abstract": "The origin of degenerative diseases of the central nervous system lies in genetic and acquired disorders. Analysis of the clinical characteristics of diseases affecting specific neuronal systems may help us to understand their pathogenesis. The stereotyped symptomatology characteristic of most degenerative diseases results from neuronal death in specific pathways: pyramidal tract and motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, nigrostriatal dopamine system in Parkinson's disease, posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord in Friedreich's ataxia, etc. This suggests that these neurons are sensitive to pathological processes that are still unknown. Progression of the disease, whether linear or not, is slow, but it is more rapid than similar effects due to ageing. This indicates either that the environmental cause of degeneration (if it exists) is continuously present or that a vital process has been once and for all disrupted, perhaps at the level of the genome, causing insufficient production of essential proteins, or accumulation of eventually toxic metabolites. Symptoms generally appear during adulthood, i.e. after normal differentiation has taken place, and after a considerable number of neurons have already been damaged. The initiation of neuronal death precedes the appearance of the first symptoms.",

Muscular tension becomes a coping mechanism to deal with somato-psychical and social difficulties. The literature shows possible biochemical correlations with states of depression, and also an impaired serotonin metabolism. However, not all patients suffer from depression. Further, a depressive, depressive-hypochondric state, and/or state of anxiety can be a consequence of fibromyalgia pain. Impaired non-REM sleep and a disturbed system of pain-modulation in the middle brain and brain stem, and a decreased tolerance of frustration, as well as frustrated aggression are assumed to be responsible for muscle contraction.In about 90% of the patients with fibromyalgia, psychoneuroses of different kinds have been found in which an impaired self- as well as an insufficient body awareness (partly as a consequence of the lasting pain) nearly always play a role. There are also significantly more life events and more problems compared to patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Four different strategies exist for therapy: 1) administration of antidepressive drugs; 2) relaxation: a) using drug therapy with benzodiazepines or meprobamate; b) with passive or, preferably, active physical therapy, resulting in physical strengthening, and leading also to an improved self-confidence c) autogenic training. 3) antirheumatic drug (for pain relief); 4) cognitive psychotherapy, individual and/or group, with the aim of cognitive reorientation, and fostering adequate strategies to cope with pain and problems.",

Recent findings The differences and/or similarities between undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome have not been studied, conceptually or empirically. The literature fails to present discriminant validity of chronic fatigue syndrome in relation to undifferentiated somatoform disorder. A critical feature is implied in the definition of undifferentiated somatoform disorder but absent from the definitions of chronic fatigue syndrome: some patients experience their fatigue as being exclusively physical and not as mental, which is prima facie peculiar, for fatigue is necessarily a mental experience. One is not able to experience fatigue without a mind (or a brain). This experience is characterized as a ‘mindless’ fatigue, underpinned by pathological reductionist thinking. By not recognizing this critical feature, diagnostic endeavours may perpetuate the problem as a function of the patient's difficulty. Summary Proponents of chronic fatigue syndrome should distinguish chronic fatigue syndrome from undifferentiated somatoform disorder, if chronic fatigue syndrome is a distinct entity at all. Further, the ‘mindless’ quality is a critical feature that needs consideration in refining the concept of undifferentiated somatoform disorder.",

Its more significant characteristic is its invariable association with other serious illnesses. In more than half of the cases it is seen in chronic alcoholic patients or in chronic illnesses accompanied by malnutrition or hydroelectrolytic disturbances. It is not related to sex or the age group. The most frequent cause is the treatment of hyponatremia, when there is a too rapid increase of the sodium levels. The basic lesion is the destruction of the myelin sheaths, with relatively unharmed axon; and it affects part or the whole base of the protuberance in a symmetrical form (pontine demyelination). The patients suffering from this illness usually present subacute progressive tetraparesis accompanied by pseudobulbar paralysis with dysarthria and the impossibility of protruding the tongue, together with partial or total paralysis of the ocular horizontal movements. Some patients present mutism and a state of paralysis with preservation of understanding and the sensory ways (pseudocoma or locked-in syndrome). The diagnosis of certainty of this entity is anatomopathologic. Nevertheless, the capacity of the computerized axial tomography (CAT), and especially that of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), to visualize the pontine lesions have largely increased the frequency of the pre-mortem diagnosis. There is not a specific treatment for this illness. It should be prevented avoiding the sharp changes in plasma sodium level in patients with hyponatremia.

Withdrawal delirium is a complication of certain substance-specific withdrawal syndromes associated with dependence on alcohol or hypnotic-sedative-anxiolytic drugs. Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium is a serious withdrawal complication occurring in about 5% of cases and occasionally leading to death from intercurrent illness. In cases involving dependence on a short-acting barbiturate, the pentobarbital challenge test helps to establish the degree of barbiturate tolerance and determine the initial pentobarbital requirement. In mild-to-moderate Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication, if the patient is conscious and ambulatory, the management is primarily directed to monitoring the vital signs and controlling agitation or aggressiveness.",

      "title": "Djinnati Syndrome in Baluchistan: The Role of Traumatic and Abuse Experiences on Individual Vulnerability",
      "abstract": "is a culture-bound syndrome in Baluchestan, Iran. Experts believe that dissociation theory is more suitable for providing a psychopathological description of this syndrome in this region. In addition, they highlight need for investigating its pathology, particularly role of factors such as traumatic and abuse experiences during childhood.\r\n\r\nAccording to 4th edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (1), the essential feature of dissociative disorders is a disruption in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception of environment. The disturbance may be sudden or gradual, transient or chronic. According to DSM-IV-TR, dissociative disorders include: dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue and unspecified dissociative disorder. A dissociate disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) is a disorder that includes a dissociative symptom (i.e. disturbance in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity or perception of environment), that does not meet criteria for any specific dissociative disorder.\r\n\r\nIn addition, according to DSM a dissociative state may be defined as a dissociative trance disorder that includes a possession or trance state. Dissociative trance disorder is a single or episodic disturbance in state of consciousness, identity, or memory that are indigenous to particular locations and cultures. Dissociative trance involves narrowing of awareness of immediate surroundings or stereotyped behaviors or movements that are experienced as being beyond one’s control. Possession trance involves replacement of customary sense of personal identity or a new identity, attributed to influence of a spirit, power, deity, or other person, and is associated with stereotyped “involuntary” movements or amnesia. It is probably most prevalent dissociative disorder in Asia. The dissociative or trance disorder is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.\r\n\r\nMany culture-related syndromes, such as amok, bebainan, latah, pibloktoq, ataque de nervios and possession, shin-byung, enchantment, lack of spirit, Zar and djinnati (2, 3), are considered as dissociative disorders. Culture-bound syndromes include a set of psychological phenomena that are of interest to psychologists and psychiatrists. The eclectic nature of this syndrome has made it difficult to have a precise definition. Thus, deciding on a specific definition has been controversial. According to DSM, term culture-bound syndrome denotes a locality-specific pattern and repetition of an aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be illnesses, or at least afflictions that mostly have local names. Culture-bound syndromes do not one-by-one match routine diagnostic system diseases. Most of these syndromes were initially reported as an issue specific to a certain culture or a relevant set, or geographically-related to original culture (4).\r\n\r\nThe term Djinnati is a culture-bound syndrome, widely known by that name in Iranian and Pakistani Baluchestan (3, 5). Based on clinical observations, this syndrome was introduced by Bakhshani and Kianpoor in Baluchestan, Iran (6). A new study by Bakhshani et al. (3) on a rural population in Baluchestan showed total prevalence of 0.5% and 1.03% among rural population and women of that population, respectively. Common symptoms of this disorder include disruption in consciousness, memory and stereotyped behaviors such as laughing, crying, speaking incomprehensibly, which are attributed to a new identity known as Djinn. Attacks usually begin with pain, irritation and sometimes limb paralysis. In some groups, loss of speech and in some other cases, speaking in different languages and change in speaking rhythm and tone of voice have been reported. In addition, there was a partial and rarely complete amnesia during attack. Some patients were far beyond their physical strength. In addition, lack of control and harming themselves and others, during attack, have been reported; although, injuries were not serious. Sometimes during attack, The patients express some demands and possessor (Djinn) requests for satisfying these demands. Attacks usually last from 30 minutes to two hours (3). \r\n\r\nIt seems that traumatic and abuse experiences have an essential role in initiation and maintenance of dissociative disorders (7, 8). Results from Bakhshani et al. (3) study showed that 43% of patients experienced their first attack after a traumatic accident (5). After civil war of Mozambique, based on results of a study reported by Igreja et al. (9) on 941 subjects (255 males and 686 females), trauma and civil war resulted damages, which explain high prevalence of this disorder.\r\n\r\nCastillo (10), believes that biological and psychoanalytic perspectives are not capable of explaining spirit possession. Etiologically, he suggested that spirit possession, similar to multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a spontaneous trance reaction to severe and negative events in environment (particularly child abuse). On other hand, Naring and Nijenhuis observed a significant correlation between traumatic events and possession experiences (11). In addition, Naring and Nijenhuis (11) considered dissociative identity disorder to be a consequence of childhood abuse or other traumatic events, thus support post-trauma model. In this regard, a study by Pasquini et al. (12), showed a relationship between traumatic experience in childhood and development of dissociative disorders. Kaplan et al. (13) found that those with higher score in dissociative experience scale had been more sexually abused during their childhood. They have been reported to commit further suicide and aggressive behaviors (13).\r\n\r\nIn general, it can be concluded that traumatic experiences, specifically childhood maltreatment and abuse, are related to possession and dissociative experiences. Therefore, in future studies, it is required to investigate type of cultural beliefs abuse and other environmental factors with onset of clinical signs of Djinatti, and then develop and practice preventive and therapeutic approaches, based on findings.",

Chronic encephalopathies may be non-progressive, occurring, for example, as a consequence of brain trauma or cerebral hypoxia, or progressive, arising as a result of an intrinsic, extrinsic or metabolic cerebral disorder. The primary focus of this article is the dementia syndromes that result from progressive degenerative disease. However, vascular disease will also briefly be addressed, because vascular dementia is relatively common and is an important cause of dementia. The traditional view of dementia as a global loss of intellect is inaccurate. Cerebral diseases do not affect the brain uniformly, but preferentially affect certain brain regions and spare others. Moreover, psychological processes themselves are regionally organized in specific brain regions. Different cerebral diseases therefore are associated with distinctive and characteristic neuropsychological syndromes, whose identification can",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the central nervous system changes that may occur after acceleration/deceleration injuries in motor vehicle accidents.Occupants of motor vehicles involved in a collision often develop a disabling syndrome consisting of head, neck, and back pain; impaired short-term memory and concentration; fatigue and a loss of stamina; poor balance; and a change in personality. Injury victims experience a loss of motivation, emotional lability, and a decrease in libido. The major features of this injury syndrome are subjective, and there usually are few objective findings on physical examination. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is poorly understood, but it is hypothesized that the collision impact produces an inertial strain injury to the anterior regions of the brain which depresses the functions of the frontotemporal lobes, at the same time, sensitizing somatosensory neural afferent systems. Damage to the orbital surfaces of the frontotemporal lobes, in particular, impairs the gating mechanisms that normally limit sensory input to the brain and further promotes central sensitization. The psychiatric disorders that emerge in the wake of these injuries are likely grounded in these pathologic events.The current literature on the biomechanics of head injury and the associated brain imaging findings in minor head injury are reviewed. A summary of some of the biochemical sequelae of strain injury to the brain is also provided, with an emphasis on the changes in energy metabolism and excitatory amino acid release.Early intervention to arrest the injury-induced metabolic cascade, and treatment with agents that activate cerebral metabolism may mitigate the symptoms of this injury syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Mental illness can arise from over-compensation of neural processes when they attempt to correct nervous system perturbation, regardless of the original cause. Initial brain compromise can be caused by genes, toxins, chemicals, infective agents, hypoxia or trauma. The original insult leads to a compensatory process of ‘rendering the synapse supersensitive’, a general neural mechanism that is involved in nervous system adaptation, repair, and regeneration. For example, in psychoses, the many and diverse early risk factors that underlie the psychosis converge to increase the number of supersensitive dopamine D2 receptors (i.e., D2 receptors that are in the high-affinity state for dopamine). Supersensitivity of synapses compensates for and protects the brain from further injury. This leads to heightened neurotransmission, which is experienced subjectively as overstimulation, with subsequent attempts to psychologically adapt. Out of individual attempts at compensation, arise the signs and symptoms that have been identified with schizophrenia and other psychoses.",

The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

Hence, a structured approach to the patient with syncope is required. History-taking remains the most important aspect of the clinical assessment. The classification of syncope is based on the underlying pathophysiological mechanism causing the event, and includes cardiac, orthostatic and reflex (neurally mediated) mechanisms. Reflex syncope can be categorised into vasovagal syncope (from emotional or orthostatic stress), situational syncope (due to specific situational stressors), carotid sinus syncope (from pressure on the carotid sinus, e.g. shaving or a tight collar), and atypical reflex syncope (episodes of syncope or reflex syncope that cannot be attributed to a specific trigger or syncope with an atypical presentation). Cardiovascular causes of syncope may be structural (mechanical) or electrical. Orthostatic hypotension is caused by an abnormal drop in systolic blood pressure upon standing, and is defined as a decrease of &gt;20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure or a reflex tachycardia of &gt;20 beats/minute within 3 minutes of standing. The main causes of orthostatic hypotension are autonomic nervous system failure and hypovolaemia. Patients with life-threatening causes of syncope should be managed urgently and appropriately. In patients with reflex or orthostatic syncope it is important to address any exacerbating medication and provide general measures to increase blood pressure, such as physical counter-pressure manoeuvres. Where heart disease is found to be the cause of the syncope, a specialist opinion is warranted and where possible the problem should be corrected. It is important to remember that in any patient presenting with syncope the main objectives of management are to prolong survival, limit physical injuries and prevent recurrences. This can only be done if a patient is appropriately assessed at presentation, investigated as clinically indicated, and subsequently referred to a cardiologist for appropriate management.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem.Cognitive deficits are common with DM which range from subclinical or subtle to severe deficits as dementia.Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are causes of cognitive impairment with DM.In patients with DM, not only severe hypoglycemia but also recurrent mild or moderate hypoglycemia have deleterious effect on the brain.Recurrent mild/moderate hypoglycemia is associated with intellectual decline, reduced attention, impaired mental abilities and memory deficits.Hypoglycemia may result in abnormalities of neuronal plasticity, synaptic weakening and scattered neuronal death in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus.Chronic hyperglycemia in type 1 and type 2 DM is associated with low IQ (verbal, performance and total) and abnormalities in testing for different domains of cognitive function as verbal relations, comprehension, visual reasoning, pattern analysis, quantitation, memory, learning, mental control, psychomotor efficiency, mental and motor processing speed and executive function.The suggested mechanisms incriminated in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia related cognitive dysfunction include, macro-and micro-vascular disease or vasculopathy, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, stress response, direct toxic effect of chronic hyperglycemia on the brain, advanced glycation end products, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress.Hyperglycemia causes oxidative stress, amyloidosis, angiopathy, abnormal lipid peroxidation, accumulation of β-amyloid and tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial pathology, apoptosis and neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus.Depression has been identified as a risk for accelerated cognitive decline with DM.The knowledge that diagnosis at early age, frequency of hypoglycemia, poor glycemic control and presence of risk factors which negatively affect cognitive functions in DM, will have important implications for treatment and for research purposes.",

      "abstract": "Background: Idiopathic longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis is defined as a focal spinal cord lesion that involves three or more segments of the spinal cord as shown by neuroimaging, and results in a profound disability. The clinical picture of a patient with idiopathic longitudinally advanced transverse myelitis is often dramatic and may consist of paraparesis or tetraparesis, sensory disturbances, and pelvic dysfunction. Idiopathic longitudinally advanced transverse myelitis is a common manifestation of the neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, but can also occur in various other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases of the CNS, such as multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, or Sjogrens syndrome, or in infectious diseases involving the CNS. It is less likely to occur in isolation, as the only manifestation of a demyelinating disease of the nervous system of an unknown etiology (idiopathic myelitis).&#x0D; Clinical case description: The clinical observation presented in the article demonstrates the difficulties of establishing a nosological diagnosis in the case of a monophasic course of TM in the absence of other autoimmune and infectious diseases of the central nervous system. The patient with idiopathic longitudinally distributed TM had no visual disturbances and no antibodies to aquaporin 4 and to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-IgG) with twice repeated tests.&#x0D; Conclusion: In this regard, it is important to dynamically monitor the clinical manifestations and MRI signs in patients with an isolated lesion of a demyelinating nature in the form of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis.",

This postinjury mental fatigue is characterized by limited energy reserves to accomplish ordinary daily activities. Persons who have not experienced this extreme exhaustion which may appear suddenly, and without previous warning during mental activity, do not under‐ stand the problem. This is especially difficult to understand as the fatigue may appear even after seemingly trivial mental activities which, for uninjured persons, are regarded as relaxing and pleasant, as reading a book or having a conversation with friends. A nor‐ mal, well-functioning, brain performs mental activities simultaneously throughout the day, but after a brain injury, it takes greater energy levels to deal with cognitive and emotion‐ al situations.",

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population.

However, the effects of DBS on nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are less clear.To review the published literature on nonmotor aspects of DBS for PD.The outcome of NMS after DBS in PD varies across studies. Some symptoms improve -sleep disorders, pain or sensory complaints, obsessive-compulsive disorder- and other aspects decline or appear -word fluency, apathy, body weight gain-. Isolated studies note mild improvements in working memory, visuomotor sequencing and conceptual reasoning, some gastrointestinal, urogenital, sweating and olfactory disturbances; whereas other studies have reported declines in verbal memory (long delay recall), visuospatial memory, processing speed and executive function; orthostatic hypotension remains without changes. The reasons for such a range of symptoms observed is due to the multifactorial etiology of the NMS, including preoperative vulnerability, changes in dopaminergic medications, surgical and stimulation effects, underlying PD-related factors and psychosocial effects. Specific patient subgroups may be at greater risk of cognitive deficits -e.g., those older than 69 years or with cognitive impairment prior to surgery- or depression, mania and suicide -e.g., those ones with preoperative psychiatric symptoms-.Patients who undergo DBS must be well-selected, weighing the risks and benefits, in order to obtain the best results with this treatment. Further multicentre studies are necessary to understand the role of DBS on NMS.",

Stress is a combination of physiological, neuroendocrine, behavioural and emotional responses to new or threatening stimuli and serves as a protective adaptation of the body under physiological conditions. In accordance with the effect on the body, beneficial and negative stress is distinguished. Stress can be divided into “chronic” and “acute”. The intensity of the physiological response to a stressor is highly individual and situationally dependent. Many variables, including personal attributes, coping strategies, social support, and past experiences may modify the physiological stress response in any given situation and can account for the different response of people exposed to the same stressor. Intense and persistent stress can lead to psychological and pathological body injury. Stress has a significant impact on different brain regions, including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala etc. Depression, anxiety, cognitive deficits, and even stress-induced mental diseases are closely related to functional and structural damage of the related brain regions. Repetitive daily acute stress can be associated with different diseases, first of all cardiovascular diseases, which affect quality of life and can cut short life expectancy. Timely treatment is required to prevent progression of early stress reactions to chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, especially in individuals at high risk. Advanced stress and anxiety management interventions include non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments.",

The degree and type of the impairment are first determined by structural damage and functionally dynamic factors. Most cognitive problems in TLE are already detectable at, or even before, the onset of the epilepsy. Accumulation of damage during the course of chronic epilepsy may add to this. This additional damage may be caused directly by severe seizures, head trauma, intoxication etc., or indirectly by interference of the epilepsy with mental development. Surgical treatment of TLE may also affect the cognitive outcome of patients with chronic TLE, with a risk of additional impairments on the one hand and functional recovery due to seizure control on the other hand. With regard to patient-associated factors, better baseline performance, younger age, cerebral plasticity, and good mental reserve capacities are associated with a better outcome. With regard to treatment-associated factors, prevention of additional brain dysfunction/damage and successful seizure control are important.",

The 1970s witnessed an \"epidemic\" of dissociative disorder, particularly DID, which may have reflected enthusiasm for the diagnosis more than its actual prevalence. Traditionally, the dissociative disorders have been attributed to trauma and other psychological stress, but the existing evidence favoring this hypothesis is plagued by poor methodology. Prospective studies of traumatized individuals reveal no convincing cases of amnesia not attributable to brain insult, injury, or disease. Treatment generally involves recovering and working through ostensibly repressed or dissociated memories of trauma; at present, there are few quantitative or controlled outcome studies. Experimental studies are few in number and have focused largely on state-dependent and implicit memory. Depersonalization disorder may be in line for the next \"epidemic\" of dissociation.",

      "abstract": "У статті розглядається питання необхідності дослідження особистісної саморегуляції в дітей із порушеннями інтелектуального розвитку. Ситуація в країні сприяє збільшенню травматичних стресів, які можуть мати серйозні наслідки для дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Ці події порушують базове відчуття безпеки особистості дитини та можуть призвести до розвитку різних психічних проблем. Травматичний стрес може викликати травматичний стресовий синдром (ТСС) або посттравматичний стресовий розлад (ПТСР), які характеризуються різними симптомами, такими як повторні спогади про травматичну подію, проблеми зі сном, харчові розлади, депресія тощо. У дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку ці симптоми можуть бути особливо вираженими та можуть потребувати специфічної та індивідуалізованої підтримки. Крім того, травматичні стреси можуть сприяти розвитку інших невротичних і психічних розладів, таких як тривожність, депресія, різноманітні фобії тощо. Ці розлади можуть значно ускладнити життя дитини й вимагати комплексного підходу до їх корекції та підтримки. Однією з важливих характеристик особистості дитини з порушенням інтелектуального розвитку є незрілість її емоційної сфери. Тому важливо вчасно виявляти та вирішувати проблеми, пов’язані з травматичним стресом, у дітей з порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Саморегуляція вважається ключовою якістю особистості й важливим фактором гармонійних міжособистісних відносин у дітей із такими порушеннями як самих із собою, так і з оточуючим світом. Саморегуляція сприяє подоланню різноманітних перешкод, що заважають повноцінному включенню дитини в реальне життя, а також дозволяє розкрити її психологічний потенціал.",

      "abstract": "A fibromialgia (FM) e uma condicao em que ha presenca de dor cronica, caracterizada por fadiga, disturbios do sono e sintomas cognitivos, como ansiedade e depressao1. Dentre esse quadro clinico, destaca-se a dor cronica, como caracteristica mais marcante, podendo levar a incapacidades laborais e declinio na qualidade de vida.\r\nA fisiopatologia da FM ainda e desconhecida, mas acredita-se que existe uma alteracao no mecanismo central de controle da dor, o qual poderia resultar de uma disfuncao dos neurotransmissores2. Assim, essa disfuncao acarretaria uma deficiencia no sistema de neurotransmissores inibitorios em niveis espinhais ou supraespinhais (serotonina, encefalina e noradrenalina), ou uma hiperatividade de neurotransmissores excitatorios (substância P, glutamato e bradicinina)3.\r\nAtraves da analise dos registros do eletroencefalograma (EEG), pode-se observar nas areas envolvidas no processamento da dor, uma hiperexcitabilidade representando um mecanismo importante na manutencao deste sintoma na FM1. Nesse contexto, alteracoes no EEG tem sido relacionadas a um biomarcador fisiologico em sindromes dolorosas distintas. Achados de perfis electroencefalograficos de grupos populacionais com dor cronica estao sendo avaliados com o intuito de elucidar a fisiopatologia da dor e promover a avaliacao e monitoramento do tratamento da dor1.\r\nEmbora alguns estudos envolvendo o uso do EEG para avaliacao da dor cronica tenham mostrado que existem algumas caracteristicas semelhantes entre individuos que sofrem de diversas sindromes dolorosas, os dados permanecem inconclusivos1. Nesse sentido, o presente artigo objetivou investigar os principais achados eletroencefalograficos, na literatura especializada, em individuos com FM no tocante: (a) a utilizacao do EEG na FM, (b) aos principais protocolos de utilizacao do EEG na FM, e (c) aos principais achados eletroencefalograficos na FM.",

Three different symptoms can be described from the cases reported in the literature: disorder of voluntary lid closing and/or opening, cortical ptosis, and inability to keep the eyes closed for more than a few seconds (,,motor impersistance\"). This last symptom can be considered as an unspecific sign of brain-damage. For the disturbance of voluntary lid opening/closure, the term ,,cortical palsy\" of lid movements is proposed. Thus this symptom can be differentiated from other supranuclear disorders of lid movements where reflectory and/or spontaneous lid movements are also impaired. As in all cases reported, the elementary motility of the eyelids (opening and closure) is impaired, it is not possible to ascertain whether a lid-apraxia is present.",

This chapter focuses on the consequences of TBIs after patients have had substantial time to recover. Brain injuries may be the basis of long-term impairments in physical, social, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning, including executive functioning. If the TBI led to a loss of consciousness, there will be an enduring, dense amnesia for the unconscious time period. Following a TBI, there is great variability in the types of cognitive deficits and the severity of those deficits depending on which areas of the brain have been affected. It is extremely challenging to integrate a patient's history of head trauma into the overall picture of an individual's clinical situation, including the psychosocial consequences of the traumatic injury. There may be considerable recovery from a TBI in the first couple of years after an initial injury.",

      "abstract": "Stress is a complex psycho-emotional state in which a person does not control himself. He is confused and lost, his speech is impaired, confusion appears, anxiety develops. An acute stress reaction occurs as a natural phenomenon. It is a consequence of prolonged experiences that are difficult to ignore. A person is in constant anxiety: he is scared, he feels heavy, he cannot concentrate, sleep normally. His entire body is in constant tension. This condition does not go away for weeks and results in a number of symptoms. The characteristics of stress directly depend on the personality, habits, and close environment. The stronger it is, the fewer negative processes occur in its life. A person has a simple reaction to stress only in cases where he has high stress resistance. He knows how to distance himself from difficulties, overcome difficulties without harming himself. Emergency response methods are abnormal reactions caused by constant internal tension. A person does not rest, does not discharge, does not calm down: internal organs, nervous and cardiovascular systems suffer due to constant stress. Acute reactions are the result of neglecting psychological problems that are a consequence of unfavorable environmental factors.

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

      "abstract": "Four cases of compulsive self-injurious behaviour (SIB) with variable degrees of tissue damage targeted to the painful body part are reported in humans with neuropathic pain. Review of human literature revealed several cases, primarily after central nervous system (CNS) lesions, during which non-psychotic verbally communicating humans (mostly with intact mental status) target specifically the painful part which is usually analgesic or hypoalgesic. In few instances, however, the involved part is not only sentient but also hyperalgesic in part or as a whole. The act is characterized by uncontrollable urge and compulsion, aggravated under conditions of stress, isolation, confusion or depression, and occasionally occurring in patients with personality disorders, ongoing drug abuse and pre-existing compulsive habits (i.e., habitual nail biting or picking). It fails to be deterred by the appearance of the injured part, social mores or even the experience of pain. Successful treatment of underlying painful dysesthesiae with specific medications, neurostimulation or surgery has resulted in marked improvement of dysesthesiae accompanied by wound healing in several cases. The four presented cases and the human literature experience provide evidence that compulsive targeted SIB in humans with neuropathic pain and painful dysesthesiae is consistent with the concept that animal autotomy may result from chronic neuropathic pain after experimental peripheral or CNS lesions.",

Transient ischaemia is probably the cause of the condition in the majority of cases although other mechanisms, particularly epilepsy, may be responsible in some. TGA may not be reported by the patient and may be misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disturbance. An acute confusional or delirious state can also produce an episode of amnesia with inability to remember events which occurred during the period of cerebral dysfunction. In TGA, however, there is an acute and temporary failure to record events without the evidence of more generalised dysfunction which occurs in delirium. During the 3 episodes reported here the patients were able to carry on with their everyday activities and to complete structured tasks, such as the preparation of a meal. TGA appears, at least in some individuals, to carry the prognosis of transient cerebral ischaemia.",

The amorphous nature of this experience has made identifying its etiology challenging, but recent advances in neurology and understanding of implicit memory and attention are helping to clarify this cognitive illusion. More specifically, déjà vu may result from (a) a brief change in normal neural transmission speed causing a slightly longer separation between identical messages received from two separate pathways, (b) a brief split in a continuous perceptual experience that is caused by distractions (external or internal) and gives the impression of two separate perceptual events, and (c) the activation of implicit familiarity for some portion (or all) of the present experience without an accompanying conscious recollection of the prior encounter. Procedures that involve degraded or occluded stimulus presentation, divided attention, subliminal mere exposure, and hypnosis may prove especially useful in elucidating this enigmatic cognitive illusion.",

HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE?Altered behaviour is common in children and has many causes.In the general clinic setting, it is important to pick up common clinical mimics of encephalopathy that can be managed without immediate referral to the hospital.These include post-ictal drowsiness from simple febrile seizures, and metabolic derangements such as hypoglycaemia.Conversely, it is also important to identify red flags in the history and physical examination that necessitate either activation of emergency services or an urgent referral to the neurologist for further workup.In particular, encephalitis accounts for a significant proportion of encephalopathy cases that persist beyond 24 hours, and can result in significant morbidity and mortality.(3) Arriving at an accurate diagnosis for the underlying cause is critical because many causes are reversible, and early specific treatment confers a better prognosis.",

These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled.

      "abstract": "La relacion entre depresion y demencia es compleja y ha sido tema de debate recientemente, debido a que las alteraciones cognitivas pueden ser encontradas en ambos padecimientos. La enfermedad de Alzheimer es una condicion neurodegenerativa  caracterizada por deterioro cognitivo, conductual y del funcionamiento global, con un inicio insidioso y curso progresivo que aparece principalmente en la vejez. Por otro lado, la depresion es un trastorno del estado de animo que en altos niveles de gravedad muestra en adultos mayores alteraciones cognitivas significativas que pueden confundirse con un sindrome demencial. Se reporta el caso de una mujer de 75 anos de edad con datos de un probable trastorno depresivo mayor y con quejas de perdida de memoria desde hace 3 anos. A la evaluacion neuropsicologica se observan alteraciones cognitivas importantes en el funcionamiento mnesico ademas del funcionamiento ejecutivo, caracterizados por: una deficiente capacidad de aprendizaje de nueva informacion con respecto a lo esperado para su edad y nivel de escolaridad, una perdida importante de elementos visuales y auditivos a corto y largo plazo, ademas de una significativa presencia de perseveraciones e intrusiones, con un marcado deficit en el automonitoreo. Como apoyo los estudios de neuroimagen muestran disminucion del volumen cortical en regiones temporoparietales bilateral, asi como hipoperfusion asociada a dichas zonas. Con los resultados de la evaluacion neuropsicologica en correlacion con las dificultades en las actividades de la vida diaria, mas los estudios de neuroimagen, se puede apoyar el diagnostico de posible demencia tipo Alzheimer, descartando el de pseudo demencia por depresion.",

      "title": "Postcardiotomy Delirium: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

The state of ebriety is a poor incentive to precise neurologic analysis and follow-up. Nevertheless, only such surveillance in acute intoxication can distinguish a specific neurological complication, a complication following a fall or prolonged immobilisation, or rapid decompensation of alcoholic encephalopathy. Among the specific complications, myopathies and strokes are described here because of their rarity compared to the more common epilepsy and withdrawal syndromes. The neurologic semiology of ebriety is reviewed, including recent pathophysiological acquisitions specifying the mechanism of functional disorders in regions susceptible to alcohol such as the cerebellum and the reticular formation.",

Moreover, 50% of all dementia patients have Alzheimer's disease. Guidelines have been established to define the types of dementia. A detailed history, which may note previous depression, and a physical examination are essential. Assessment of the patient's mental status and a neurological examination may help to distinguish other forms of dementia from Alzheimer's disease. Brain imaging and psychometric testing may also help to establish a diagnosis. Metabolic screening for reversible causes of dementia, such as thyroid disturbance or electrolyte-imbalance, is essential. Common features of Alzheimer's disease include memory loss; difficulty with problem solving, abstractions, and calculations; and language and visuospatial deficits. Delusions are common in the early phase of the disease. It is not yet possible to diagnose Alzheimer's disease with complete accuracy. Additional neurophysiological and biochemical markers for diagnosis must be developed.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "abstract": "Istifragh or tanqiya-e-badan (body waste clearance) is an important therapeutic modality, prevalent in Unani System of Medicine, applied to treat various chronic diseases. Brain, like other parts of the body, needs to maintain homeostasis to function properly, and that requires continuous removal of toxic wastes. Brain possesses specific waste disposal system. The glymphatic system serves as a brain waste disposal system. BBB also facilitates the efflux of toxic metabolites out of the brain.The brain’s waste consists of metabolites, and proteins such as amyloid- beta, tau and alpha- synuclein proteins etc., which can form aggregates that are deleterious to brain. Sleep deprivation , aging and many other brain pathologies (i.e. stroke, ischemia, tumour, injury etc.) may disrupt glymphatic function. Some non-pharmacological therapeutic modalities such as exercise, sleep, sleeping posture, intermittent fasting and dietary regimens (omega-3 fatty acids, resveratrol etc.) are powerful drivers of glymphatic transport. Unani herbal drug, Ustukhuddus (Lavandula stoechas L.) is also used for istifragh-e-dimagh or tanqiya-e-dimagh in Unani System of Medicine since long time.This review addresses current scientific knowledge regarding understanding and significance of Istifragh-e-dimagh with special reference to prevention and / or treatment of chronic neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

Similar unusual and unexpected effects of cerebral lesions are observed in patients with different types of the disease. Special attention is paid to stroke and traumatic brain injury. The paper presents the results of studies showing a decrease in the severity of extrapyramidal disorders, pain syndromes, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and various kinds of addictions in patients after a stroke. Cases of regression of epileptic seizures and behavioral disorders after traumatic brain injury are also considered. It is emphasized that such unusual effects are based on the reorganization of cerebral connections with the activation of inhibitory mechanisms that normally do not manifest themselves clinically, or with certain features of neuroplasticity processes occurring in pathological conditions.",

      "abstract": "Causes of diseases are well narrated in Ayurvedic texts. Intellectual error is identified as major cause of diseases and its role in the manifestation of psychosomatic diseases is well explained in Charaka Samhita. Smriti is the faculty of mind that plays an important role in perception of knowledge. It is one of the components of Pragya according to Ayurveda. It is the recalling capacity of the knowledge which is perceived by the brain from past experiences. The Smriti is determined by various factors like Prakriti, age, Ahara-vihara, repetition of events etc. The consideration of all the factors can provide better knowledge to improve smriti. If the person is not able to grasp or retain the present events or experiences, it is known as Smritivibhransha. Modern science considers various components of memory which includes recent &amp; past concentration, recalling, retention and recognition. Memory is the ability of an individual to record sensory stimuli, events, information, etc., retain them over short or long periods of time and recall the same at a later date when needed. Poor memory, lower retention and slow recall are common problems in today’s stressful life. Age, faulty diet, stress, emotions and other factors may lead mild cognitive impairment to memory loss. Ayurvedic science deals with various Herbo-mineral preparations &amp; procedures mentioned for excellence of memory. Key words: Smriti, Smritivibhransha, memory, Pragya, Ayurveda protocols.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are defined as unpleasant or undesirable behavioral or experiential phenomena that occur predominately or exclusively during the sleep period. Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

Diagnostic criteria of neurologic FAS include (1) the accent is considered by the patient, acquaintances, and physician to sound foreign; (2) the accent is different from speech prior to cerebral insult; (3) it is related to CNS damage and is not psychogenic; and (4) the patient does not have a history indicating a reason for having an accent. Most individuals have accompanying left cerebral hemisphere lesions or have a pathologic disruption between cerebral and cerebellar speech centers. Individuals who experience cerebrovascular accidents are particularly susceptible to FAS. It has been reported that problems with articulation and comprehension can eventually lead to FAS. Psychogenic FAS is sometimes considered a subcategory of conversion disorder and has common comorbid psychiatric conditions including depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia and can present with additional conversion disorders. FAS can also present independent of other comorbid conditions.",

      "title": "Confabulation: Implications for Criminal Justice, Forensic Mental Health, and Legal Professionals",
      "abstract": "Physical and psychological brain disruptions have the ability to impair vital memory functions and processes. For instance, a physical injury to the brain’s frontal lobe can disrupt executive functions, which would include the capacity to plan or multitask, impulse control, and decision making. Similarly, the presence of a degenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s disease can degrade the frontal lobe and lead to executive dysfunction (e.g., short-term memory loss and Broca’s aphasia-a dysfunction of language production). A dangerous potential result of such frontal damage is a phenomenon known as confabulation, which is the unintentional production of memories and statements that are objectively false. In other words, confabulation is lying without the intention of doing so. This cognitive disturbance not only has an impact on daily life, but confabulation is particularly problematic for criminal justice-involved individuals. In general, confabulation makes it difficult for an individual to participate in and navigate through all aspects of the criminal justice system. Moreover, those who may work on behalf of the afflicted, may be negatively impacted by their inability to discern truth from fiction. Individuals suffering from confabulation may be prone to waiving important legal rights (e.g., Miranda rights) or false confessions during interrogations, incompetence to stand trial (i.e., unable to follow legal proceedings and assist defense counsel with their case), or providing false testimony during trials. Each possibility detracts from the integrity of various legal processes. Despite these diverse consequences, there is a dearth of empirical research on the consequences of confabulation in criminal justice settings. In an effort to raise awareness of confabulation in the criminal justice system and encourage further research, this article provides an overview of the symptoms and effects associated with confabulation for professionals working in criminal justice, forensic mental health, and legal settings.",

      "abstract": "Chronic heavy drinking and alcoholism can have serious repercussions for the functioning of the entire nervous system, particularly the brain. These effects include changes in emotions and personality as well as impaired perception, learning, and memory. Neuropathological and imaging techniques have provided evidence of physical brain abnormalities in alcoholics, such as atrophy of nerve cells and brain shrinkage. At the cellular level, alcohol appears to directly affect brain function in a variety of ways, primarily by interfering with the action of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and other neurotransmitters. Neurological disorders also can result from vitamin deficiency and liver disease, two health problems that commonly occur with alcoholism. Other hypotheses, based on factors such as aging, gender, and genetics, have been developed to explain various alcohol-related neurological consequences. Many pharmacological treatments to improve neuropsychological functioning in alcoholics have been tested, but none has proved entirely successful. With prolonged abstinence, however, slow recovery of cognitive functioning can occur in some cases.",

      "title": "Normal and Pathological Aging: From Animals to Humans",
      "abstract": "While aging is associated with modest declines in certain aspects of cognitive function (memory, executive function, processing speed), many cognitive domains can remain relatively stable until late in life. In contrast to the mild decline observed in normal aging, pathological aging such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects global cognitive function – impairing memory, language, thinking, and reasoning, and interferes substantially with daily living capacity. Changes in the structural integrity of the brain underlie the cognitive declines that occur in both aging and AD, however different brain structures are affected. In healthy aging, mild functional changes are predominantly detected in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, while in AD, pathology initially accumulates and disrupts function in the medial temporal lobe (disrupting memory), progresses to cortical structures, and eventually globally impacts the brain. Cognitive decline with normal and pathological aging is mediated by a complex interaction of multiple factors that include genetic and nongenetic risk factors that determine the age of onset as well as the rate of decline. Importantly, the progression and decline can be prevented or slowed by certain lifestyle factors (exercise participation, stress management) and pharmaceutical interventions (statins, hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women). While most individuals will experience some degree of cognitive decline with aging, conversion to MCI or AD is not an inevitable consequence of aging. It is likely that additional strategies to promote healthy brain aging will be uncovered in the next years that will further contribute to successful brain aging and will help to maintain a high quality of living through the last decades of life.",

Such forces disrupt normal cellular processes in the brain. Concussions are seen in all age, gender and ethnic groups but, because they are commonly sustained during sports and recreational activities, they have frequently been described in children. The estimated incidence of sports-related concussions in the USA ranges from 300000 to 3.8 million annually. 2 Estimating incidence is difficult because sports-related concussions frequently go undetected due to a lack of recognition of symptoms or intentional underreporting of symptoms. 34 Symptoms include physical complaints (eg, headache, fatigue, dizziness, noise intolerance), behavioural changes (eg, mood swings, depression, anxiety, irritability) and cognitive impairment (eg, inability to concentrate, decreased memory). While initial symptoms typically resolve in several days to occasionally several months after the injury, 5e8 in 10e15% these symptoms can persist much longer. Because of the heterogeneity of these injuries and their recovery, as well as the recognition that the length of time until symptoms resolve is more important clinically than the type of symptoms, grading scales and classification schemes have been abandoned.

Such activities mayincludemorephysicallystrenuousgameplayforathletes,but also simply the cognitive exercise of classwork for students or work for adults.

The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

      "title": "Alcohol-Induced Blackout",
      "abstract": "Blackouts from acute alcohol ingestion are defined as the inability to recall events that occurred during a drinking episode and are highly prevalent in both alcoholic and nonalcoholic populations. This article reviews the clinical manifestations, epidemiology, risk factors, cognitive impairment, and neurobiology associated with alcohol-induced blackout, with special emphasis on the neurochemical and neurophysiological basis, and gender differences. Two types of blackout have been identified: en bloc, or complete inability to recall events during a time period, and fragmentary, where memory loss is incomplete. The rapidity of rise in blood alcohol concentration is the most robust predictor of blackout. Alcohol impairs different brain functions at different rates, and cognitive and memory performance are differentially impaired by ascending versus descending blood alcohol concentration. Cognitive and memory impairment occurs before motor impairment, possibly explaining how a drinker appearing fully functional can have little subsequent memory. Blackouts are caused by breakdown in the transfer of short-term memory into long-term storage and subsequent retrieval primarily through dose-dependent disruption of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell activity. The exact mechanism is believed to involve potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-alpha-mediated inhibition and interference with excitatory hippocampal N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation, resulting in decreased long-term potentiation. Another possible mechanism involves disrupted septohippocampal theta rhythm activity because of enhanced medial septal area gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurotransmission. Women are more susceptible to blackouts and undergo a slower recovery from cognitive impairment than men, due in part to the effect of gender differences in pharmacokinetics and body composition on alcohol bioavailability.",

      "title": "Alcohol Consumption – Implications in Orthopedic Trauma",
      "abstract": "In mental health field is established that alcohol consumption can exacerbate an underlying mental health disorder. Among people with severe mental health are common alcohol problems. Alcohol depress the central nervous system and this might produce moods fluctuation and worsen the depression and anxiety. At heavy and/or chronic drinkers were reported several symptoms involving cognitive ability including diminished brain size, memory loss, loss of attention span, loss of visuospatial abilities, inability to think abstractly, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Alcohol can temporarily alleviate feelings of depression and anxiety, so people tend to use it as a form of ‘self medication’ in order to cheer themselves up or as a sleep help. But also, alcohol can disturb the body’s ability to rest, so it can lead to reduced energy levels. The key to mental health patients who regularly consume alcohol is the toxic cyclical process created. At first, one drink to relieve depression, but alcohol deplete serotonin levels, so the patient feels more depressed and thus necessitating more alcohol to ‘treat’ his depression. Sometimes it can also reveal or intensify underlying feelings, evoke past memories of trauma or any other event associated with painful feelings. Moreover, alcohol has pain-reducing properties (sustained also in a systematic review published in December 2016 issue of “The Journal of Pain”) by decreasing the activity of nerves within the brain. Furthermore, this chronic ‘self medication’ with alcohol has a wider action on the body. 1. Growing Bone - Epidemiological studies shows that chronic alcohol consumption at young age affect the bone’s health; it has multiple effects on osteoblasts (forming cells), slows down the bone turnover and can increase the risk of osteoporosis. 2. Adult Bone - There were studies on animals and researches in human adults made to prove the relationship between alcohol consumption and bones’ health. The results show that the alcohol consumption is less damaging for adults than young people, but research has shown that seventh decade women or older who consumed an average of more than 3 ounces of alcohol/day (equivalent of six drinks) had greater bone loss than women who had minimal alcohol intake. (Hannan et al. 2000) So postmenopausal chronic heavy drink women have an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures. Researches suggest that alcohol consumption and poor nutrition and/or tobacco use lowers even more bones’ mineralization and increase the likelihood of bone fractures. Dr. Iliriana Bisha Tagani presented for SteadyHealth the relationship between alcohol consumption and joint pain. Alcohol dehydratate the organism because of it’s diuretic properties. Ligaments are structures rich in water and need water periodically to remain soft and spongy. So high alcohol consumption leads to excess removal of water from the body. The ligaments are one of the first to get affected by dehydration so they lose from their elasticity and any movement of the joints can lead to unbearable pain and arthritis (moreover, alcohol is considered an arthritis „trigger food”). 3. Immunity - Chronic heavy consumption of alcohol can suppress the immune system after a period of time. It can also cause neuropathy, making someone feel a pins and needles sensation in their extremities, a compounded effect with those who suffer from arthritis. In conclusion, patients with mental health disorder present an increase tendency of alcohol abuse, which predominant leads to articular and bones disfunctions. These patients also presents a high tolerance pain due to analgestic and neuropathic effects which frequently masks the symptoms of affections like arthritis.",

Neurons are highly specialized cells and are responsible for communicating information in both chemical and electrical forms. Unlike other cells, nerve cells normally do not divide and multiply; thus the body does not replace dead or damaged neurons. Neurodegenerative disorders result in progressive degeneration and/or death of nerve cells and can be defined as hereditary and sporadic conditions characterized by progressive nervous system dysfunction. Most of these disorders are associated with degeneration of the affected central or peripheral structures of the nervous system. Neurodegenerative disorders include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease), prion diseases, brain cancer, epilepsy, encephalitis, hydrocephalus, genetic brain disorders, and others. Most of them are incurable and burdensome conditions that cause complications with movement (ataxias), or mental functioning (dementias).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer disease is the most common degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that causes dementia. Fragmentation and repetitive arousals/awakenings characterize the sleep of persons with dementia. Confusion, agitation, and wandering can occur at night (“sun downing”), further contributing to sleep disruption (Box 10–1). Sleep complaints may be due primarily to the underlying dementia or to related sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements of sleep, or secondary depression. Reversal of the sleep-wake rhythms can be seen with patients complaining of nocturnal insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography may demonstrate decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and REM density. Sleep efficiency is reduced. Management includes proper sleep hygiene practices (eg, avoiding caffeine, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and eliminating daytime naps), and treatment of concurrent depression and medical disorders, including pain syndromes, that might contribute to sleep disturbance. Short-term use of hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, or eszopiclone, may be tried for insomnia.",

The discrepancies of the clinical findings themselves sometimes demand attention and benefit the patient when they lead to the identification of disturbances which could not at first be recognized.

Yet, excessive daytime sleepiness is not only common, and it often goes unrecognized.

The spectrum of common sleep disorders includes circadian rhythm changes, shiftwork requirements, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, also known as insomnia. In many cases, however, sleep deprivation is the choice of the patient, chosen in response to long commutes, academic rigor, or occupational matters.

      "abstract": "Acute symptomatic seizures are those caused or provoked by an\r\nacute medical or neurological insult and it is as common as epilepsy in the\r\nmedical wards. Acute symptomatic seizures differ from epilepsy in several\r\nimportant aspects. First, unlike epilepsy, these seizures have a clearly\r\nidentifiable proximate cause, to the extent that one can never be certain of\r\na causal association. When one considers the temporal sequence of acute\r\nsymptomatic seizures (e.g.uremia, head injury, or stroke immediately\r\npreceding a seizure), the biologic plausibility (acute disruption of brain\r\nintegrity or metabolic homeostasis) and in many cases the dose effect\r\n(severity of injury correlated with the risk for seizures) all quite\r\ncompellingly indicate causation. Although a risk ratio for the immediate\r\nassociation between cause and effect has not been calculated, it must be\r\nenormous. Second, unlike epilepsy, acute symptomatic seizures are not\r\ncharacterized by a tendency to recur. The risk for subsequent epilepsy may\r\nbe increased in individuals experiencing such insults; in general, one does\r\nnot expect seizures to recur unless the underlying condition recurs. \r\nThe maximum incidence of seizures occurred in the age group of 60\r\nto 70 years in the study.\r\nCerebrovascular disease was the most common etiology observed in\r\nour study. Among cerebrovascular disease, ischemic cerebral\r\ninfarction was the most common cause. Central nervous system\r\ninfections, was the second most common cause followed by\r\nmetabolic causes in our study. So all efforts should be taken to\r\nevaluate the patients who presented with seizures in the elderly\r\npatients to identify the etiology, for accurate management.\r\nPartial seizures was the most common seizure type encountered in\r\nthe study.\r\nImmediate non contrast CT brain was useful, for emergency\r\npatients, presenting with seizures to guide appropriate acute\r\nmanagement. MRI Brain was useful in detecting lesions, which were\r\nmissed in CT Brain. Both CT Brain and MRI Brain were\r\nindispensable in patients with acute symptomatic seizures in the\r\nelderly.",

Zu den wichtigsten Symptomen einer Demenz gehören die Gedächtnisstörung, die Einbuße im Denk- und Urteilsvermögen, in der Konzentrationsfähigkeit und der Informationsverarbeitung. Störungen des Sozialverhaltens, des Antriebs oder der Stimmung treten in der Regel hinzu. Die Symptomatik ist so ausgeprägt, dass die übliche Alltagsbewältigung beeinträchtigt wird. Weniger schwere Symptomkonstellationen werden als leichte kognitive Störung vom Demenzsyndrom abgegrenzt. Sie äußern sich meist in Einbußen der Merkfähigkeit (Abrufstörung), intervenieren hingegen nicht mit der Bewältigung der gewohnten Alltagsaufgaben. Die mit Abstand häufigste Form einer Demenz ist die Alzheimer-Krankheit, gefolgt von der vaskulären Demenz. Weitere, irreversibel verlaufende Demenzursachen sind etwa die Parkinson-Demenz, die Demenz mit Lewy-Körperchen und die frontotemporalen Degenerationen. Potenziell behebbare Ursachen für eine Demenz sind besonders zu beachten, z.B. Depression, kommunizierender Hydrozephalus oder Hypothyreose. Für die Therapie ist zudem die Erhebung der noch vorhandenen Fertigkeiten des Patienten wichtig. Eine verständliche Aufklärung des Patienten über seine Erkrankung sollte die Regel für den Arzt sein, Ausnahmen hiervon muss er begründen.",

Many alternative causes of encephalitis can be excluded after a careful clinical history and evaluation of the CSF, brain MRI, and routine blood tests. Some types of encephalitis can be suspected before receiving the results of neural antibodies, according to the clinical presentation (for instance, faciobrachial dystonic seizures in anti-LGI encephalitis, or psychotic manifestation in anti-NMDAR encephalitis) or brain MRI features (temporal lobe involvement in limbic encephalitis).

La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil.

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

Many young people referred for residential treatment have a long history of family dysfunction that may include experiences of abuse, \ndomestic violence, substance abuse in the home, or neglect, and often school failure \nand aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. Typical diagnoses include Major Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychotic Disorders, Conduct Disorder, Substance \nAbuse Disorders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and other severe personality and \npsychological disorders. They often present with symptoms of oppositional/defiant \nbehavior, anger outbursts, severe mood disturbance, anxiety, self-injurious behaviors, \nsubstance abuse, and poor social skills.

Cross-condition comparison of the nature and frequency of cognitive impairment is difficult as these conditions often coexist, and there exists no consensus as to the definition of cognitive impairment, nor the optimal number and type of neuropsychological tests required for evaluation. There is as yet no clear evidence for condition-specific profiles of cognitive impairment. Rather, a generalized profile consisting of subclinical levels of impairment in attention, processing speed, executive, and memory functions from bilateral frontal-subcortical ischemia fits across all conditions. This profile: occurs only in subgroups of patients; is inconsistently related to measures of illness severity; is unrelated to patient self-report or level of functional independence; is exacerbated by very high levels of emotional distress; and is reversible in some cases but can also progress to frank neurological disease (dementia) in others, especially the elderly, when multiple conditions coexist, and/or when medical condition severity progresses.",

Behavioral or pharmacological stressors typically impair cognitive memory mediated by the hippocampus, but enhance stimulus-response habit memory mediated by the dorsolateral striatum. Evidence also indicates that the effect of emotion on different kinds of memory critically depends on a modulatory role of the basolateral amygdala (BLA). BLA modulation of multiple memory systems may be achieved through its glutamatergic projections to other brain regions, which may enhance stress hormone activity, modulate competition between memory systems, and alter synaptic plasticity. The neurobiology underlying the emotional modulation of multiple memory systems may be relevant to understand the impact of emotional arousal on the development and expression of human psychopathologies characterized by maladaptive habitual behaviors (e.g., drug addiction and relapse).",

      "abstract": "Neurologists are often called to evaluate central nervous system [CNS] manifestations in patients with suspected or definite systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]. The manifestations are highly diverse and often have major prognostic consequences. The major difficulties are to determine if the given manifestation is primarily due to SLE activity in the brain, or a consequence of metabolic disturbances, infection, or corticosteroid use. The true incidence of CNS manifestations attributable to SLE is not entirely clear, but several studies show prevalence rate between 15-75%, depending on criteria adopted. For cognitive impairment, the prevalence ranges from 17-59%. Cognitive impairment may be attributed to emotional distress, corticosteroid use, active systemic disease or primary CNS dysfunction. These manifestations may occur even in the absence of other neuropsychiatric [NP] manifestations clearly attributable to SLE. The etiology of cognitive impairment may be related to autoimmune mechanisms, such as brain-specific autoantibodies. Despite several studies using computer tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], brain structural abnormalities could not be associated with cognitive findings in SLE patients. Functional neuroimaging methods may be more sensitive for detecting subclinical brain involvement related to cognitive dysfunction in SLE. Despite the fact that cognitive impairment may be residual in patients with previous CNS involvement, it also may be an early marker of CNS involvement in previous asymptomatic patients. This article will review clinical assessment, pathogenic mechanism, and the role of neuroimaging methods in the evaluating of SLE patients with cognitive impairment.

The complex faculty is taken to include orientation, attention, memory, language functions, gnosis, visual perception, comprehension, abstraction, reasoning, constructional praxis, judgement, and new learning. Definitions of dementia emphasize memory loss, the presence of other cognitive disturbances, a progressive course, and the presence of diffuse brain disease. Thus the DSM-IIIR criteria for probable Alzheimer’s disease require the presence of dementia; deficits in two or more areas of cognition; progression; normal consciousness; and the absence of other diagnosable pathologies. The diagnosis is supported by progressive deterioration of specific cognitive skills; impaired Activities of Daily Living and inappropriate behaviour; positive family history; normal cerebrospinal fluid; normal electro-encephalography (EEG) or non-specific changes only; and CT evidence of cerebral atrophy. But to require the absence of other pathologies begs the question as to the diagnosis and makes the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease one of exclusion. In this chapter, we will survey briefly those conditions which fulfil many of the criteria for Alzheimer’s disease but exhibit physical signs or other clinical features which disallow that diagnosis. As there are so many of them, those occurring less frequently are included in an appendix at the end of this chapter.",

      "title": "Fatigue and sleep disturbance following traumatic brain injury: A role for light therapy?",
      "abstract": "Fatigue and sleep disturbances are common and disabling symptoms following traumatic brain injury (TBI). They occur chronically, and impact significantly on the ability of individuals with these injuries to return to pre-injury function, as well as overall quality of life. The aetiology of these symptoms appears to be complex and most likely multifactorial in nature, involving the primary effects of mechanical neuronal injury, but also secondary factors such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive disturbance (particularly in the domain of attention). In the context of unclear aetiology, current understandings of fatigue and sleep disturbances have primarily relied on patient self-report, particularly for fatigue which is inherently a subjective complaint, but also for sleep disturbances. Identification of suitable objective measures for fatigue and sleep or their associated symptoms may assist in further understanding these complaints. Related to the limited understanding of these complaints following TBI, is the lack of well established treatment regimens. In theory, an optimal treatment of fatigue and sleep disturbance following TBI would involve focus on the symptoms themselves as well as their associated factors, such as depression and impaired attention. Recent research in the field of sleep and chronobiology, particularly research investigating the therapeutic applications of light exposure, suggests that light therapy may offer an efficacious modality for treatment of fatigue, sleep disturbance and associated symptoms in the TBI population. \n\nThe aims of the current thesis were to: (1) assess the utility of objective assessment tools in order to aid further understanding of disturbances to sleep-wakefulness and sustained attention (i.e. psychomotor vigilance) performances following TBI; and (2) investigate in a randomised controlled trial, the efficacy of blue light therapy, in the treatment of fatigue and its related symptoms in patients with TBI. This was achieved across three separate studies. \n\nSpecifically, study one investigated the utility of actigraphy as an objective measure of sleep following TBI. The findings of the study revealed significant associations between actigraphic and self-reported (diary) estimates of nocturnal total sleep time (TST) and daily TST in patients with TBI and healthy age- and gender- matched controls. While stronger associations between diary and actigraphy were observed in the control group, the magnitude of these associations did not differ significantly between groups. The study thus provided preliminary support for use of actigraphy as an objective assessment of sleep duration in the TBI population. \n\nIn light of previous research that has demonstrated associations between vigilance/sustained attention and both fatigue and sleep disturbances in patients with TBI, study two compared psychomotor vigilance performance in patients with TBI and healthy age- and gender- matched controls using the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). The PVT was selected as a potentially useful objective measure in patients with TBI as it has been commonly used within the sleep science field and is well accepted for its sensitivity to sleep loss, circadian timing, and countermeasures for sleepiness. Consistent with past research, study two demonstrated that patients with TBI showed slower performances and increased attentional lapses relative to healthy controls. Distribution analyses additionally revealed that patients with TBI performed more slowly across the entire performance distribution, consistent with a generalised cognitive slowing. Depression, fatigue and daytime sleepiness were found to have varying impacts on aspects of psychomotor vigilance performance. Previous use of the PVT in TBI groups has been limited and the study highlighted the sensitivity of the PVT to sustained attention deficits in patients with TBI. \n\nTaken together, the findings of study one and two have implications for the ongoing assessment of sleep and performance deficits in patients with TBI, and have potential to provide greater understanding of fatigue and sleep complaints in this population. \n\nFinally, given the lack of efficacious treatments for fatigue and sleep disturbances following TBI, study three examined the efficacy of blue light therapy as a potential treatment of fatigue and its associated symptoms in patients with TBI. Blue light therapy was selected for use given prior research findings which have demonstrated its alerting, circadian phase shifting, and mood enhancing properties. In a sample of patients with TBI who had self-reported fatigue and sleep complaints, study three demonstrated the efficacy of daily, morning exposure (45 minutes) to blue light over a 4 week treatment period in alleviation of self-reported fatigue and daytime sleepiness. This is the first demonstration of efficacy for a non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue and daytime sleepiness in patients with TBI. These findings establish the basis for large-scale randomised controlled trials of light therapy for fatigue in TBI, and have important implications for enhancing rehabilitation participation and long-term quality of life following TBI.",

      "abstract": "Nonspecific activity-related arm pain is characterized by an absence of objective physical findings and symptoms that do not correspond with objective pathophysiology. Arm pain without strict diagnosis is often related to activity, work-related activity in particular, and is often seen in patients with physically demanding work. Psychological factors such as catastrophic thinking, symptoms of depression, and heightened illness concern determine a substantial percentage of the disability associated with puzzling hand and arm pains. Ergonomic modifications can help to control symptoms, but optimal health may require collaborative management incorporating psychosocial and psychological elements of illness.",

      "abstract": "Patient-reported, subjective outcomes are promoted as a standard for ethical, valid studies in many neurological disorders. Such outcomes are considered potentially more sensitive and specific to important therapeutic effects, and may be more linked to disability and disease-related life losses than conventional assessments of impairment (e.g. ability to walk, performance on language tests, serological or radiological indices). Self-report is invaluable to identify social and emotional consequences of brain injury: depression, changes in intimate and family relationships, social role and community participation losses. However, common stroke-related neuropsychological deficits are likely to confound subjective stroke outcome measures. The scientific community focused on stroke-related health outcomes may arrive at {significantly underestimated} patient reports of stroke-related disability, caused by a failure to adjust for the effect on self-report of spatial neglect, deficits of magnitude estimation, pathologic alteration of self-awareness, and alteration in distributed cortical systems supporting emotional semantics and abstraction.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Dissociative Amnesia remains an enigmatic and controversial entity. It is classically described as responsible for autobiographic amnesia associated with a traumatic event. Objectives To report a clinical case and review the literature. Methods We collected data from the patient’s clinical file with his informed consent. We conducted a non-systematic review of the literature. Results A 46-years-old patient presents to the emergency department for sudden global retrograde amnesia, with multiple domain amnestic syndrome (impairing verbal and visual memory, processing speed, mental flexibility, calculus, executive functions and language). He was initially admitted for a suspected infectious meningoencephalitis, which was not confirmed. Later an autoimmune encephalitis was pursued. Brain MRI showed a nonspecific left temporal and hipocampal hyperintensity and the EEG a mild left temporal dysfunction. The autoimmune encephalitis panel was negative and the formal diagnostic criteria were not met. The neurologic examination at discharge presented only with autobiographical and semantic amnesia. On the mental state examination, he presented with depressive symptoms reactive to the situation. There was no evident traumatic event apart from a promotion received the day before the amnesia started. He was prescribed escitalopram 10 mg/day. The amnesia was maintained at 9 months follow-up. Conclusions Our case report illustrates a case of amnesia without evident organic or psychogenic cause, assumed as a dissociative amnesia. Further studies are necessary to clarify the pathophysiology of this condition and develop specific treatments. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a clinical syndrome with a high degree of morbidity that may follow a traumatic event. PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "abstract": "Parental alienation is defined as a mental state in which a child, usually one whose parents are engaged in a high-conflict separation or divorce, allies himself strongly with one parent (the preferred parent) and rejects a relationship with the other parent (the alienated parent) without legitimate justification. Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children. Fathers who have lost some or all contact with their children for months or years following separation or divorce may be depressed and suicidal.",

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver.

Psychosocial and neurochemical factors, specifically serotonin dysfunction, are postulated etiologies. Treatment approaches include cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and psychotropic medication. To relieve the symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, in higher dosages than those typically recommended for other psychiatric disorders, may be necessary.

      "title": "The role of sevoflurane in postoperative cognitive dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Sevoflurane, a 200 dalton chemical molecule, is an inhalation anesthetic used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, which is used by a specially calibrated volatilizer.[1] As with all inhalation anesthetics, sevoflurane can cause dose-related cardiorespiratory hypofunction. Nausea and vomiting are the most common postoperative adverse effects, and other frequent adverse effects include hypotension, bradycardia, and cough.[2] Relatively rare adverse effects include elevation of aspartate aminotransferases and acute renal failure.[3] However, there are few reports of neurological effects after surgery, particularly postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). POCD is a central nervous system complication that occurs after surgery, especially in the elderly, manifested as changes in personality, social skills, cognitive abilities and skills, and degeneration of intellectual functions such as memory and concentration decline.[4] The pathogenesis of POCD mainly involves neuroinflammatory response caused by microglial activation, calcium overload-induced mitochondrial damage, and neuronal apoptosis due to oxidative stress,[5,6] all of which affect hippocampal function, resulting in a series of cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, we attempt to elucidate the mechanism, related signaling pathways, and molecular regulation of sevoflurane-induced POCD based on existing literature reports. This will help to identify possible treatments to reduce the incidence of POCD and improve the prognosis of POCD, thereby optimizing the sevoflurane anesthesia program, reducing patient discomfort, and improving the quality of life of patients. Mechanism and molecular regulation of sevoflurane-induced POCD: The mechanism of sevoflurane-induced POCD is still not well understood, and researchers explore its related molecular and pathway changes mainly through basic experiments, and the mechanism is mostly close to neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis (Table 1 and Figure 1). After treating elderly mice with sevoflurane, Chai et al.[7] found that the level of acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein-32A protein increased, which inhibited the acetylation of histones H3K18 and H3K14, thereby preventing H3K18 and H3K14 from binding to GluN2B and GluN2A promoters, causing a decrease in synapse-related protein expression, and finally leading to POCD. It can be seen that the integrity and plasticity of neuronal synaptic function are of great significance in POCD. He et al.[8] found that after treatment with sevoflurane, methyltransferase-like 3 phosphorylation in hippocampal tissue may be inactivated by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, resulting in perturbation in m6A (N6-methyladenosine) RNA methylation, which causes pathogenesis in POCD. Sleep disorders can aggravate the occurrence of POCD. Shen et al.[9] found that after sevoflurane was used to treat sleep-deprived rats, the level of salt-induced kinase 3 in the brain tissue increased, which made the levels of phosphorylation- and total-tau rise, and the level of acetylation decreased, thereby causing POCD. It can be seen that this pathophysiological process involves the salt-induced kinase 3 signaling pathway. In mouse hippocampal primary neuronal experiments, Zhu and Ma[10] found that the levels of inflammatory indicators interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α increased after treating neurons with sevoflurane. The mechanism was that sevoflurane activated Hoxa5, thereby upregulating long non-coding RNA Gm5106 and directly targeting the anti-inflammatory molecule miRNA-27-3p. Similarly, Cheng et al.[11] found that in SH-SY5Y cells, sevoflurane intervention caused elevated acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long chain family member 4 expression. Downregulation of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long chain family member 4 alleviates sevoflurane-induced ferroptotic cell death, and in-depth exploration shows that acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long chain family member 4 is involved in sevoflurane-induced ferroptotic cell death through the adenosine 3'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.[11] In a study related to ferroptotic cell death, Ge et al.[12] treated old mice with sevoflurane, and iron overload occurred in mouse brain tissue, resulting in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn led to glucose metabolism disorders. At the same time, sevoflurane also inhibits oxygen uptake and glucose absorption. In this way, the cross-dysfunction of iron and glucose causes apoptosis of cortical and hippocampal neurons through the Bcl/Bax pathway.[12] Mind bomb-2 is also an important molecule involved in ferroptotic cell death, which significantly rises in mouse hippocampal tissues after treatment with sevoflurane. Knockdown of mind bomb-2 expression reduces neuronal death and ferroptotic cell death by the fact that lowering mind bomb-2 levels reduces binding to glutathione peroxidase 4, thereby reducing glutathione peroxidase 4 degradation and enhancing glutathione peroxidase 4 stability.[13] MicroRNAs also play an important role in the pathogenesis of sevoflurane-induced POCD, particularly in relation to the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway. Zhao et al.[14] found that miR-124, which had the effect of preventing apoptosis and inflammatory response through the NF-κB signaling pathway, was inhibited in hippocampal neurons after the intervention of sevoflurane in mice. However, another microRNA has an exacerbating effect on the sevoflurane-induced inflammatory response. Wei et al.[15] found that miR-182-5p, which could be released by plasma exosomes, rose in the rat POCD model. Inhibition of plasma exosomes and miR-182-5p could relieve learning and memory impairment, reduce the level of inflammatory factors, upregulate neurotrophic factors, and inhibit NF-kB pathway.[15] In addition, studies have shown that mitochondrial autophagy is also involved in the pathogenesis of POCD, and sevoflurane treatment can inhibit mitochondrial oxidative respiratory chain and autophagy flow, which will cause changes in mitochondrial morphology and affect mitochondrial autophagy function, thereby causing cognition-related disorders.[16]Figure 1:: Mechanism of sevoflurane-induced POCD.Note: Created with BioRender.com. AMPK: Adenosine 3'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-B; POCD: postoperative cognitive dysfunction.Table 1:: The mechanism of POCD induced by sevofluraneIn a neonatal rat experiment, Zhu et al.[17] found that USP1-associated factor 1 inhibits the degradation of NOD-like receptor protein 3 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which can aggravate sevoflurane-induced POCD. Therefore, downregulation of USP1-associated factor 1 reduces cognitive impairment. Mao et al.[18] conducted a study using wild-type C57BL/6 mice and protrophic factor knockout mice treated with sevoflurane. The study revealed that the presence of multi-acting proteins can worsen sevoflurane-induced learning dysfunction. However, the knockout of multi-acting proteins and the use of multi-acting protein receptor inhibitors can help mitigate sevoflurane-induced neuroinflammation as well as cognitive and learning dysfunction. This suggests that pleiotrophin plays a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of POCD. However, in a separate study,[19] researchers aimed to create an aged rat model of POCD using sevoflurane anesthesia. They found that overexpression of C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 had beneficial effects such as inhibiting cell apoptosis, reducing inflammation, minimizing brain tissue damage, and improving cognitive impairment. These effects were achieved by regulating two key pathways: adenosine triphosphate-activated protein kinase/SIRT1 and phosphoinositol 3-kinase/AKT.[19] Studies have shown that miR-140-3p can negatively target DNA methyltransferase-1 to reduce 5-hydroxytryp-tamine receptor 2A promoter methylation, which upregulates 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A expression and activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/Nrf2 pathway, thereby improving neuronal survival and reducing sevoflurane-induced POCD.[20] In addition, long non-coding RNA Rian can also play a protective role in neurons by regulating the miR-143-3p/LIM domain kinase 1 axis.[21] It can be seen that the molecular regulation involved in sevoflurane-induced POCD is very extensive. Therefore, it is also important and urgent to select the appropriate target to manage POCD. Management of sevoflurane-induced POCD: At present, there is no mature treatment for POCD, and the reported treatment methods are limited to animal experiments. We hope that the approach compiled will provide guidance and ideas for further treatment options. Peng et al.[22] found that cistanche, a Chinese herbal medicine, can play a role of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-microglial activation by activating the PPAR signaling pathway, thereby alleviating sevoflurane-induced neuroinflammation and improving hippocampus-dependent memory loss. Chikusetsu saponin IVa, another active ingredient derived from traditional Chinese medicine, could alleviate neurological dysfunction by inhibiting the NOD-like receptor protein 3/ caspase-1 pathway to reduce apoptosis and neuroinflammation.[23] Carnosol, extracted from rosemary, can also reduce sevoflurane-induced neuroinflammation, prevent microglial activation, and inhibit apoptosis, mainly by regulating the NF-kB pathway.[24] In the rat POCD model, Wei et al.[25] found that dexmedetomidine, a clinically commonly used sedative, promotes neuroactivity and reduces apoptosis by upregulating miR-129 levels that targets inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. Glucagon-like peptide 1 analog liraglutide, a new type of hypoglycemic drug, has been found to improve spatial learning and memory ability of aged rats after sevoflurane anesthesia, and play an anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effect in hippocampal tissue, thereby reducing cognitive dysfunction.[26] In a study investigating the effects of different doses of vitamin D on POCD, Zhang et al.[27] found that high levels of vitamin D can improve cognitive dysfunction after sevoflurane anesthesia by enhancing hippocampal cholinergic activity and reducing the expression of inflammatory factors. A study has also shown that sevoflurane can reduce cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, block protein kinase A-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, increase apoptosis and reactive oxygen species to induce cognitive impairment.[28] Thus, roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, maintains normal levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate as well as the activity of the above signaling pathways, thereby improving rat neurological function.[28] Necroptosis, which is related to calcium overload, also plays a role in the pathogenesis of POCD in aged rats. The use of necrostatin-1, an inhibitor of necroptosis, can improve neuroprotective effects of cognitive function by increasing BDNF pathway activity and inhibiting necroptosis-related pathways.[29] In addition, it has been reported that electro-acupuncture pretreatment can alleviate sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction, and its mechanism mainly lies in inhibiting calcium overload and reducing mitochondrial damage and neuronal apoptosis of hippocampal neurons.[30] Similarly, atmospheric normobaric hyperoxia preconditioning can also reduce sevoflurane-induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, thereby improving POCD.[31] Intestinal dysbacteriosis can increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier in aged mice after sevoflurane surgery, thus inducing POCD. Lactobacillus may reduce the blood-brain barrier permeability to protect neurological function.[32] Conclusion: POCD induced by sevoflurane is clinically common, especially in elderly patients. Cognitive dysfunction will adversely affect the normal life of these patients. We have found that the pathogenesis of POCD lies mainly in neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and hippocampal dysfunction, but current treatments are still very limited or limited to animal experiments. Thus, we hope that these experiments may provide some guidance and new ideas for clinical treatment and give helps to these patients.",

Simply defined, it is intellectual disintegration. The manifestations of dementia vary considerably, reflecting the mental, social, and emotional resources of a person before his illness began. Unfortunately, it often strikes the individual at the height of his productivity. The first symptom of the condition may be a decrease in expected level of functioning, and thus the disease may be very closely tied to the patient's work or professional status. It is important to note that the symptoms that usher in the process of dementia differ little from those that occur in normal people who are exhausted, anxious, or under severe pressure. Thus, a frequent early complaint is that the patient is",

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

Ils peuvent se manifester de plusieurs facons, allant d'un simple inconfort en vision de loin ou de pres a des symptomes plus marques tels qu'une fatigue oculaire ou des cephalees. On definit les troubles de l'accommodation soit par : -­ Une perte ou une paralysie de l'accommodation qui s'explique par une gene ou une incapacite a lire de pres sans correction. Il s'agit d'une atteinte du muscle ciliaire et/ou a une mydriase par stimulation du nerf sympathique ou par inhibition du systeme parasympathique. -­ Un spasme d'accommodation a l'origine d'une myopie transitoire. Cela s'explique par la contraction permanente du muscle ciliaire et s'associe, en cas d'origine medicamenteuse, a un myosis par stimulation excessive du systeme parasympathique. Les medicaments parasympathomimetiques induisent ainsi un myosis actif, et les medicaments parasympatholytiques une mydriase passive. A l'inverse, les medicaments sympathomimetiques alpha-­adrenergiques provoquent une mydriase active, et les medicaments sympatholytiques alpha-­adrenergiques un myosis passif.

      "abstract": "Agitation is a frequent clinical condition that notably raises the hospital morbidity. It generally coexists with a wide range of mental and cognitive symptoms and has a diverse clinical course. Agitation is a state of extreme restlessness or irritability including excessive muscular activity accompanied by a sense of inner strain and exceeding restlessness associated with mental discomfort. It occurs frequently in psychiatric units, emergency rooms, and nursing care homes, and is a common condition experienced by the patients especially of neuropsychiatric diseases. Agitation is the third most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptom in dementia, behind apathy and depression, with an overall approximate prevalence of 30%. Agitation has variable prevalence as per the diseases. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the etiology, epidemiology and common disorders associated with agitation. Trauma particularly to the head, widespread infection, sepsis, dementia, delirium, exposure to toxins, electrolyte imbalances, endocrine abnormalities, and a post-ictal state is one of the risk factors for agitation. Agitation prevalence varies between 30% and 50% in Alzheimer's disease, accounts for 30% in dementia with Lewy bodies, 40% in frontotemporal dementia, and 40% in vascular dementia, as per the various studies. Agitation is a broad category of unrelated behaviours that frequently changes course and is visible in a range of clinical settings. Several underlying pathophysiologic conditions are mediated by dysregulations of the dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and GABAergic systems. Further research will be helpful in defining new management strategies.",

      "abstract": "Despite multiple and often overlapping definitions of disability and frailty, both are common clinical characteristics of aged individuals though not identical. The geriatric syndrome of frailty is described as status of global impairment of physiological reserves involving multiple organ systems. The clinical correlate of frailty manifests as increased vulnerability, impaired capability to withstand intrinsic and environmental stressors, and limited capacity to maintain physiological and psychosocial homeostasis. Geriatric frailty is found in 20–30% of the elderly population over 75 years and increases with advancing age. It was reported to be associated with long-term adverse health-related outcomes – increased risk of geriatric syndromes, dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional placement, and mortality. The clinical phenotype of frailty manifests as multi-system pathologies characterized by low physical activity, global weakness with low muscle strength, fatigability/exhaustion, overall slowness particularly of gait, loss of weight among others. These above-mentioned clinical symptoms could be explained by (or related to) some ‘preclinical’ diagnoses such as sarcopenia, osteopenia, nonspecific balance disorders, nutritional problems, and overall deconditioning. More recent studies found the frailty clinical phenotype to be associated with pathologic laboratory markers (IL-6, CRP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, IGF-1, D-dimers), which suggest possible pathogenesis involving hormonal dysregulation, immuno-aging, pro-coagulation and pro-inflammatory status. In the article, current recommendations for future research strategies of frailty syndrome will be discussed.",

Social anhedonia in healthy people is related to changes in structure, activation, and connectivity of different regions in the prefrontal, temporal, parieto-temporal, and basal areas. In patients with schizophrenia the core fMRI correlates of social anhedonia are located in the temporal lobe. Studies in social anhedonia in depressions and other mental disorders are insufficient for drawing conclusions on this topic.

The societal burden from anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms of all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis on identification of the specific features of particular disorders. Need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, level of associated disability, impact on everyday life, presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatments. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics and patient and doctor preferences. There is much overlap between different anxiety disorders in evidence-based and effective therapies (e.g. prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or course of cognitive behavioural therapy), but there are important differences. It thus helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep.

Several syndromes should always raise the possibility of a paraneoplastic etiology, including Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome, subacute cerebellar degeneration, severe sensory neuronopathy, limbic encephalopathy, and opsoclonus-myoclonus. None of the clinical syndromes, however, have an absolute association with neoplasia, and each can occur in patients without tumors.",

Psychodynamic formulation is commonly used to understand the patient’s unmet needs and could guide management plan. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is not the mainstay psychological treatment for OCD. Nevertheless, psychodynamic understandings are crucial to understanding the formulation of symptom. This case report illustrates a patient who is suffering from OCD which originated from his unresolved fixation in psychosexual anal stage, harsh superego, neurotic defense mechanisms of undoing and isolation of affect, and insecure attachment worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

Second, are psychological amnesias, usually diagnosed as psychoneurosis or hysterias. Third, is feigned amnesia. The distinctive features and the legal complications of these various types of amnesia are discussed. The electroencephalogram ram seems to provide evidence which in many cases may assist in distinguishing pathological amnesia from the other forms. In those cases in which an illegal act is the result of a period of amnesia which in turn is accompanied by a disorder of the electrical waves of the brain, treatment by means of medicine instead of by incarceration seems reasonable. Intensive research on this point is urgently needed.",

Neuropathic pain is defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system. The term dysfunction is not clearly defined and is suggested not used. The prevalence of neuropathic pain is unknown, but a few detailed studies show that neuropathic pain is more common than previously assumed. Some common causes of neuropathic pain are entrapment/injuries to peripheral nerves, painful neuropathies, infections in the nervous system (i.e. postherpetic neuralgia), spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis and cerebral infarcts. Evaluation of neuropathic pain is performed on the basis of a thorough clinical examination which includes detailed questioning of different types of pain. Both spontaneous (ongoing and paroxysmal) as well as evoked pain may occur. The ongoing pain may be described by a large number of adjectives such as burning, aching, throbbing, sore, cutting, but there is no pain descriptor which is diagnostic for neuropathic pain. Pain may usually be evoked by lightly touching the skin or by exposure to cold. A clinical neurological examination is necessary in the evaluation of the level of injury, possibly also electromyography/neurography in case of peripheral nerve lesions or CT/MR in case of central lesions. Neuropathic pain is almost always characterised by changes in sensibility, usually involving the thin-fibre system (peripheral nerve fibres or central projections). Special emphasis is put on the examination of sensory dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem. Cognitive deficits are common with DM which range from subclinical or subtle to severe deficits such as dementia. Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia are causes of cognitive impairment with DM. In patients with DM, not only severe hypoglycaemia but also recurrent mild or moderate hypoglyacemia have deleterious effect on the brain. Recurrent mild/moderate hypoglycaemia is associated with intellectual decline, reduced attention, impaired mental abilities and memory deficits. Hypoglycaemia may result in abnormalities of neuronal plasticity, synaptic weakening and scattered neuronal death in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic hyperglycaemia in type 1 and type 2 DM is associated with low IQ (verbal, performance and total) and abnormalities in testing for different domains of cognitive function such as verbal relations, comprehension, visual reasoning, pattern analysis, quantitation, memory, learning, mental control, psychomotor efficiency, mental and motor processing speed and executive function. The suggested mechanisms incriminated in the pathogenesis of hyperglycaemia-related cognitive dysfunction include, macro- and microvascular disease or vasculopathy, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, stress response, direct toxic effect of chronic hyperglycaemia on the brain, advanced glycation end-products, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Hyperglycaemia causes oxidative stress, amyloidosis, angiopathy, abnormal lipid peroxidation, accumulation of β-amyloid and tau phosphorylation, neuro-inflammation, mitochondrial pathology, apoptosis and neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus. Depression has been identified as a risk for accelerated cognitive decline with DM. The knowledge that diagnosis at an early age, frequency of hypoglycaemia, poor glycaemic control and presence of risk factors negatively affect cognitive functions in DM will have important implications for treatment and research purposes.",

There is general agreement that anomie has something to do with the absence of values and norms, defining ends and means. Social anomie is more than the sum of individual anomies; there is also the absence of institutionalisation. Epistemologically anomie can be identified as an intervening variable mediating between independent and dependent clusters of variables. Anomie is not the same as political action in general, and not the same as misery or poverty, or the whole repertory of social problems. But it may cause some of these problems as a factor accompanying any major transition. An early warning system with a dangerously high level of anomie would include low level of faith in the system that was, low level of faith in the new system, high level of egoistic cost-benefit analysis, including violence, corruption, apathy, drug consumption, the inner journey, maybe suicide.",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

Persistent primary negative symptoms are considered to be part of the schizophrenia disease process and represent an unmet need for treatment, while secondary negative symptoms are associated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia, other mental disorders (e.g. depression, substance abuse), extrapyramidal symptoms, social deprivation, etc. Validated rating scales are helpful in the evaluation and measurement of negative symptoms. Current consensus supports the focus on the following five domains (five ‘As’): blunted affect, alogia, anhedonia, asociality, and avolition.",

      "title": "Management of Acute Onset Catatonia Postpartum in a Patient With a History of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Une crise d’epilepsie resulte de la survenue soudaine d’une activite neuronale anormalement intense, rythmique et synchrone dans une region plus ou moins etendue du systeme nerveux central. Les consequences cliniques sont extremement variees, selon les zones cerebrales affectees et la duree des crises, allant de breves secousses musculaires tres focalisees a une perte de conscience complete, eventuellement associee a des convulsions. Dans le cas de l’epilepsie-absence, une epilepsie generalisee d’origine genetique survenant frequemment chez les enfants, les crises s’expriment essentiellement par une suspension des processus conscients dans toutes leurs dimensions, y compris une interruption des perceptions conscientes. Ces symptomes sont correles a des decharges de pointes-ondes (DPO) dans les electroencephalogrammes (EEG) bilateraux. Les mecanismes physiopathologiques des alterations de conscience au cours des crises d’epilepsie-absence restent l’objet de debats intenses, opposant des alterations fonctionnelles a grande echelle a un filtrage des informations exogenes par les oscillations epileptiques. Au cours de mes recherches, j’ai explore l’hypothese alternative, mais non exclusive, d’un dysfonctionnement dynamique dans les processus d’integration sensorielle au sein des circuits thalamo-corticaux primaires. Des explorations electrophysiologiques fines n’etant pas realisables chez les enfants epileptiques, j’ai utilise un modele genetique presentant une forte homologie avec la pathologie humaine : le Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). En combinant in vivo des enregistrements electrocorticographiques (ECoG) et intracellulaires dans le cortex somatosensoriel primaire (S1), precedemment identifie comme le site de declenchement des crises, j’ai d’abord analyse les proprietes integratives et d’excitabilite des neurones pyramidaux du cortex S1, durant et en dehors des crises, et je les ai comparees a celles des neurones homologues chez des rats non epileptiques. J’ai montre que ces neurones presentent lors des periodes inter-ictales une excitabilite accrue, s‘exprimant par une augmentation de la decharge des neurones en reponse a des stimulations excitatrices d’intensite croissante ainsi qu’une tendance exacerbee a se re-polariser suite a une hyperpolarisation de grande amplitude, suggerant un accroissement du courant cationique h. Au cours des crises, les memes neurones montraient des changements differentiels dans leur excitabilite membranaire selon la composante pointe ou onde dans l‘ECoG correspondant. La pointe etait associee a une augmentation de decharge evoquee par un courant depolarisant et a une diminution de resistance membranaire. Symetriquement, l’onde etait correlee avec une augmentation de resistance membranaire et une diminution d’excitabilite. Ces changements dynamiques des proprietes integratives neuronales suggerent une instabilite des reponses corticales lors du cycle pointe-onde pouvant « brouiller » les signaux sensoriels lors des crises. J’ai teste cette hypothese en analysant les reponses des neurones corticaux, et des neurones thalamo-corticaux correspondants, a des stimulations appliquees sur les vibrisses controlaterales. Bien que les reponses synaptiques induites dans les neurones du cortex S1 par les stimulations sensorielles n’etaient pas globalement alterees lors des crises, elles etaient plus amples et plus efficaces pour declencher des potentiels d’action pendant l’onde compare a la composante pointe. Cet accroissement relatif de la reponse neuronale lors de l’onde ECoG resulte probablement de l’accroissement de resistance membranaire precedemment decrit, d’une augmentation de la force electromotrice des courants synaptiques glutamatergiques et de la forte probabilite de decharge des neurones thalamiques correspondants lors de cette composante.",

The exceptions are those which mimic psychopathology: akathesia and akinisia. Akathesia resembles anxiety. Akinesia is similar to depression, residual schizophrenia, and demoralization. Differential diagnosis may require interruption of the neuroleptic. Whether neuroleptics can cause depression not associated with akinesia has never been established. The first obligation of the clinician is to be sure that the depressive symptoms are not concomitants of akinesia, before treating with antidepressants which may not be the appropriate treatment. There is no convincing evidence that one neuroleptic drug is more likely to cause akinesia than another, although this had not been studied extensively using a broad definition of akinesia.",

      "abstract": "Patients presenting with bodily symptoms and complaints that are not sufficiently explained by organic pathology or well known pathophysiological mechanisms present a major challenge to any health delivery system. From a perspective of psychiatric classification these medically unexplained somatic symptoms may be diagnosed as primary psychiatric disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders on the one hand, as somatoform disorders on the other. Among medical specialties a separate diagnostic approach is taken to conceptualize functional somatic syndromes. Unfortunately, both diagnostic systems do not conform to each other very well. The concept of somatoform disorders as outlined in DSM-III to DSM-IV-TR and in ICD-10 refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders with prominent somatic symptoms or special body-focussed anxieties, or convictions of illness. These disorders seem to indicate medical conditions that cannot, however, fully be explained either in terms of medical diagnostics or of other primary psychiatric disorders. There is one major conceptual assumption that postulates a decisive impact of psychosocial stress on the origin, onset and/or course of these somatic symptoms and complaints. And there is one major path of diagnostic steps to be taken, i.e. just to count the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, to determine their reference to any main organ system, to prove that they are not self-induced, to put special stress on prevailing pain symptoms and to separately assess dominant health anxieties or illness convictions. Since introduction of the diagnostic concept of somatoform disorders there have been arising many critical issues regarding the soundness of this diagnostic category. These issues, among other things, refer to a problematic mind-body dichotomy overemphasizing psychosocial and psychological factors and neglecting major neurobiological processes, to the impracticable criterion of “medically unexplained”, to the demand of conceptual clarity and coherence of this diagnostic category, to the rather trivial diagnostic procedure of just counting the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms whereas not assessing typical dimensions of illness behaviour in a corresponding way, to the major overlap between subgroups of somatoform disorders on the one hand and factitious disorders, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders on the other, to a principal focus on the epidemiologically rare condition of somatisation disorder as core disorder thereby undervaluing much more prevalent subthreshold conditions, to the difficult communication of the whole diagnostic group to medical colleagues dealing with the same problems by using a different conceptual approach, however. These critical issues surrounding the concept of somatoform disorder will be reflected in respect of some major revisions projected in future diagnostic classification systems of DSM-V and ICD-11.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a very complex disorder of the central nervous system. It is characterized by a sudden, disordered and excessive neuronal shock that causes different clinical evidences with specific related electroencephalogram (EEG). Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES) can seriously complicate the diagnosis of epilepsy. The separoxysmal events have the same clinical evidences of epilepsy, such as an impairment of the self-control and a range of sensory, motor and mental manifestations, without the typical related electroencephalogram (EEG) because of the absence of an organic cause. The overwhelming majority of Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures are related to psychological factors like dissociation. This is a defense mechanism used to cope stressful events or emotional conflicts. Psychological or psychiatric disorders, like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), are frequently associated to Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures. In this article, we present a case report of epilepsy combined with Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures. A joint intervention is of great significance in this occurrence. The subject received a psychological assessment including psychometric and projective tools. He stood MMPI-2, Wais-R, SCL-90, Rorschach test and graphic tests. A psychological disorder related to defense mechanisms was identified. The subject presents a tendency to convert his fears and emotive pains in rational and more socially acceptable problems, using his body to express his discomfort. Patient with epileptic seizures should receive a psychological assessment to exclude Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures. Further studies should propose guidelines to integrate neurological, psychiatric and psychological intervention.",

      "abstract": "When a person with a head injury arrives at the hospital, doctors and nurses first check life signs: cardiac work, blood pressure and breathing. For those who do not breathe satisfactorily, a extractor fan may be required. Doctors immediately assess the patient's state of mind and memory. They also test the brain's basic functions by checking the size of the pupils and their response to light, assessing reactions to sensations such as heat and stab of the needle, and testing the ability to move their arms or legs. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is required to evaluate possible brain injury. Traumatic brain injury occurs when an external mechanical force causes brain dysfunction. Brain trauma is usually the result of a violent hit to the head. An object that pierces the skull, such as a bullet, can also cause brain trauma. Mild trauma can be caused by temporary brain cell dysfunction. More serious brain trauma can lead to bruising, torn tissue, bleeding and other physical injuries to the brain, which can result in long-term complications or even death. Head injuries are the cause of disability and death of people under the age of 50, more than any other type of neurological impairment. Nearly half of people with severe head injuries die. The brain can be damaged even when the skull is not pierced.",

Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

      "abstract": "Depression is recognised as the most common mental health disorder in the elderly. It does not only increase the morbidity, but it increases the mortality as well. Depression is an illness characterised by the depressed mood, causing changes in the overall thinking, observation, physical condition, behaviour and social functioning. The common depression symptoms are sadness, hopelessness, anxiety, dejection, indisposition, nausea, passiveness, self-doubt, despondency, loss of interests and sources of pleasure, lack of energy and increased tiredness. Other possible symptoms include sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, concentration and attention difficulties, loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, gloomy and pessimistic view of the future, and self-harming and suicidal thoughts. Poor physical health has long been recognised as one of the most important risk factors of depression in elderly people. Also, retirement, loss of workforce, stress, loss of a loved one and the grieving process cause the development of depressive symptoms.However, depression in the elderly is largely associated with physical illnesses.Physical illness and depression can develop at the same time, but depression can also appear as a consequence of a physical ilness or as a side effect of medications.Depression treatment begins after well-conducted diagnostics, based particularly on the intensity of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and comorbidity.In the treatment of depression conditions, some basic guidelines must be followed, such as sufficient treatment with an appropriate dosage of medication, the choice of antidepressants in accordance with the safety profile and clinical picture, regular combination of psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and the conduction of quality evaluation.Suicide prevention is the main goal of treatment among the elderly.Despite the knowledge that antidepressants and psychological interventions are equally effective in older patients and young adults, depression in the elderly is insufficiently treated mainly because it is not adequately diagnosed.",

The psychological consequences of having a wound may include stress, sleep disturbances, negative mood and social isolation.

Principales signos etiologicos: 1. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo se presenta con mas frecuencia sobre un fondo hereditario muy acentuado en individuos que muestran marcada debilidad de orden reactivo y, a veces, de orden endogeno. 2. o La constitucion psicopatica se resalta, en su aspecto biologico general, ante todo por su gran fatigabilidad. El agotamiento causado por el trabajo o por la presion ejercida por los afectos representa un importante momento auxiliar en la evolucion de la enfermedad. La constitucion sexual muestra, al tiempo que una nitidez de las tendencias pasionales, una dificultad del contacto con el sexo opuesto, una inhibicion extremadamente fuerte de las pulsiones y una carencia del instinto erotico. Dicha constitucion revela los estigmas de una maduracion parcialmente retardada. 3. o La edificacion de la enfermedad, una vez se han admitido los elementos endogenos ya expuestos, es psicologica y reaccional, y se caracteriza por la triada formada por el caracter, la experiencia vivida y el medio. 4. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo esta condicionado por la disposicion caracterial 1; se forma segun reglas precisas: cuanto mas sensitiva es la disposi­ cion, mas tipicas son las manifestaciones del delirio. El caracter sensitivo es enor­ memente astenico. Desde una perspectiva psicologica, se ubica entre el caracter expansivo y el caracter astenico puro. Se caracteriza por una falta de expansion, una incapacidad psiquica de efectuar una descarga. La neurosis de relacion sensi­ tiva se diferencia de la variante obsesiva del caracter sensitivo por el contraste mas acentuado de tensiones interiores. La personalidad de un neurotico sensitivo presenta, por una parte, una suavidad extrema, una debilidad, una sutileza, una vulnerabilidad y, por otra parte, un cierto grado de ambicion, de conciencia en si y de tenacidad. Los representantes mas perfilados de este grupo caracterial son individuos complicados, de elevada inteligencia y de gran valor; poseen una sen­ sibilidad fina y profunda, y poseen una etica escrupulosa.

These illnesses are associated with prominent and disturbing behavioral changes, as well as difficulties with \"higher-order\" cognitive functions, such as planning and judgment.

Disorders of the nervous system can ruin the lives of individuals and are of such a magnitude that they create many of our greatest social problems. People become mentally ill, insane, or psychotic and a few such individuals in a society can destroy its fabric. People can become addicted to drugs. They can ruin their lives, and their habits create an underworld willing and able to exploit them. Some people become alcoholics. The chapter discusses about schizophrenia disorder. The primary characteristic of schizophrenia is the impairment of logical thought processes. Speech is often bizarre and confused, reflecting a disturbed mind. Thoughts that are usually only remotely connected emerge together in speech (loose associations), and in extreme cases speech may be completely incomprehensible. Depression is another behavioral disorder. It is diagnosed as being either primarily endogenous or exogenous. The endogenous form of depression refers to severe depression that occurs in the absence of any identifiable external source; the exogenous form of depression results from external stresses.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

Once considered relatively uncommon, it is frequently encountered in clinical practice, particularly in treatment-resistant depressed patients. Psychotically depressed patients respond poorly to antidepressants, but remission is likely with neuroleptic-antidepressant combinations or electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotic depression may be unipolar or bipolar with early or late onset and may be more likely to occur in patients with a history of childhood psychic trauma. Much is known about the course and treatment response of obvious presentations of psychotic depression, but more must be learned about depressed patients who have intermittent, subtle, or mild psychotic symptoms and about the ways in which the capacity to become psychotic interacts with the capacity to become depressed to produce a syndrome greater than the sum of its parts.",

      "abstract": "Numerous medical signs and symptoms Motor Behavior diseases produce disturbances of body movement and physical behavior along with mental symptoms. From the moment clinicians first see patients, they quite naturally notice many things about their motor behavior: body posture, degree of muscle tension, amount of fidgeting or pacing and facial expression. The muscles of the eye and face are innervated by cranial nerves that originate in the brain. Consequently, disturbances in facial or eye muscle functioning provide crucial clues about whether individua's difficulties originate in the nervous system outside the brain or within brain. Neurological soft signs are subtle, lifelong abnormalities in motor and sensory functioning that are likely caused by imperfect embryonic development or minor, early brain injury. “Automatic behavior” refers to rote movement behaviors that are carried out by individuals in an altered state of consciousness. An apraxia might involve difficulty in performing relatively simple movements or complex action sequences involving objects.",

Many(18-71%) of the spontaneous panic attacks tend to occur from a sleeping state unrelated to the situational and cognitive context. Nocturnal panickers experienced daytime panics and general somatic sensation more frequently than other panickers. Despite frequent distressing symptoms, these patients tend to exhibit little social or occupational impairment and minimal agoraphobia and have a high lifetime incidence of major depression and a good response to tricyclic antidepressants. Sleep panic attacks arise from non-REM sleep, late stage 2 or early stage 3. The pathophysiology and the similarity of nocturnal panic to sleep apnea, dream-induced anxiety attacks, night terrors, sleep paralysis, and temporal lobe epilepsy are discussed.",

Intercurrent illnesses sometimes develop in spite of bed rest, as when myocardial infarction occurs during convalescence from a pelvic or orthopedic operation. In most cases the evil effects of complete bed rest are potentiated by anesthesia, narcotics or other medication or by the results of the original illness. But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position. In any discussion of the effects of complete bed rest it is to be borne in mind that the disorders noted may have been aggravated, or even initiated, by a depression",

Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

Strict reliance on test data can be misleading when testing patients with prominent orbital frontal lobe injury. The conditions of testing may also inadequately mask many of the patient's impairments and may lack sufficient \"ecological validity.\" Frequently psychologists fail to take a chronological history of the injury, the patient, or interview the family or significant others.

A stroke occurs when there is a blockage or bleed in the vascular system of the brain, while a TBI results from an external force to the head. Older adults are at a higher risk of both stroke and TBI; thus, overall incidence is increasing as the proportion of older adults in the population is growing. Stroke and TBI result in immediate and long-term cognitive changes. Impairments in the domains of language, attention, memory, executive functions, perception, and social cognition have been documented following stroke and TBI. However, strokes tend to cause focal or selective cognitive disorders, while cognitive deficits following TBI are widespread and can be generalized. Individuals who have suffered a stroke or TBI may also experience psychosocial changes; for example, symptoms of depression and anxiety are common. Functional outcomes, including independence in activities, are varied and are associated with a range of factors including age, injury severity, cognitive disorders, and psychosocial factors. To achieve optimal outcomes for individuals following stroke and TBI, and to reduce the impact of the injury on everyday functioning, a multidisciplinary rehabilitation process is recommended.",

Due to the characteristic clinical picture of AD, its diagnosis should not be a problem, except at the very beginning of the disease. Many AD patients are never diagnosed and therefore are not adequately treated in clinical practice. Agents used for general anaesthesia reduce cholinergic transmission, which is manifested by loss of consciousness, pain, voluntary movements and memory. In patients with compromised memory and cognitive functionality, general anaesthesia can postoperatively have an adverse effect on the prognosis of degenerative cerebral disease.

The negative effect of drugs on cognitive functions is realized due to many pathophysiological mechanisms: disruption of hormonal regulation, decreased neuronal excitability, increased activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, decreased cerebral circulation, atrophic changes in the brain; many mechanisms have not been fully established. Risk factors for the development of drug-induced CIs are: old age or childhood, brain damage, chronic diseases, genetic factors, the patient's initial CI, polypharmacy, dose and duration of drug use, acute infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, dehydration, acute urinary retention, etc. To diagnose and differentially diagnose drug-induced CI, it is necessary to establish a connection between the start of taking a suspected drug-inducer and a decrease in cognitive functions. The first step in the treatment of drug-induced CI is the abolition of an inducer drug or a reduction in its dose, in cases where it is impossible to discontinue the drug and there is no replacement, special slow-release dosage forms can be considered. The main measures to prevent drug-induced CI include the use of drugs with the lowest risk of their development, assessment of drug interactions, and the use of modern scales to assess the risk of developing this side-effect (anticholinergic burden scale, etc.).",

The impairment was especially serious with regard to personal memories during the 5 months prior to admission, while he had first been working as a full-time employee under stressful circumstance. A diagnosis of dissociative amnesia was made on the basis of absence of any systemic or neurological diseases that could cause amnesia, the inadaptable character of the patient, the nature of amnesia, and presence of stressful condition possibly related to the amnesia. Visual event-related potential (ERP) studies recorded with human face discrimination tasks demonstrated a P3a wave in response to a face of his superior in the office, whom he said that he had never seen before. The similar P3a wave was observed in response to a face quite familiar to the patient, his mother, but not to a face truly unknown to him. These findings suggest that the visual memory of his superior's face exists in the brain, but the patient is unable to retrieve it by some psychogenic mechanism. 131I-IMP SPECT revealed decreased perfusion in the left medial temporal lobe and the basal forebrain, suggesting the association between dissociative amnesia and focal brain dysfunction. While dissociative amnesia has been understood as psychogenic nature, both ERPs and SPECT are quite important tools to understand the association between the psychological phenomenon and biological changes of the brain in this disorder.",

It can be associated with other dramatic symptoms of a psychotic nature likely to cause diagnostic uncertainty. Methods and results: These points are illustrated by the case of a young man with a severe bipolar affective disorder who independently developed terrifying visual, auditory and somatic hallucinatory episodes at sleep onset, associated with a sense of evil influence and presence. The episodes were not obviously related to his psychiatric disorder. Past diagnoses included nightmares and night terrors. Review provided no convincing evidence of various other sleep disorders nor physical conditions in which hallucinatory experiences can occur. A diagnosis of predormital isolated sleep paralysis was made and appropriate treatment recommended. Conclusions: Sleep paralysis, common in the general population, can be associated with dramatic auxiliary symptoms suggestive of a psychotic state. Less common forms are either part of the narcolepsy syndrome or (rarely) they are familial in type. Interestingly, sleep paralysis (especially breathing difficulty) features prominently in the folklore of various countries.",

      "abstract": "The research in this dissertation focuses on the psychosocial consequences of stroke and traumatic brain injury. Psychosocial consequences are reduced thinking functions such as concentration and memory problems, emotional consequences such as anxiety and gloominess and reduced participation in society. Participation includes, for example, participation in activities such as work, housework, sports and social contacts.The results of the study show that a large proportion of people living at home recover well from brain injury, but some do not. For example, people are afraid of a new stroke or are unable to resume work because they have concentration problems. Because the psychosocial consequences for the outside world are not always visible, more structural attention is needed. Low-threshold aftercare by nurses provides this essential attention to psychosocial problems: people feel reassured. Moreover, this is a relatively inexpensive form of care for people living at home with brain damage.",

      "title": "Two Cases of Narcolepsy Patient Portraying a Tendency of a Dull Learning Ability and Mistaken as an Idle Student",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sleepiness is associated with many different conditions and, as a neglected topic, it can be the cause of serious psychologica l and social disadvantages. In the aspect of learning, additional pro blems may arise from poor progress in school caused by the effe ct of sleepiness on concentration, memory, and other cognitive functi ons. Narcolepsy is by no means the most common cause of excessive sleepiness. Nonetheless, it is not a rarity, especial ly in young people. The non-specific nature of early features o f narcolepsy, combined with very limited awareness that the condition can start in various ways, leads to many misinterpretations. Misinterpretation of narcolepsy symptoms is not confined to the medical profession. Teachers may well be critical of a student with narcolepsy because of their perception of narcolepsy symptoms a s laziness, poor motivation, or difficult behavior and dull lea rning ability. Inappropriate reactions by parents, teachers, and peer s, based on misinterpretation of narcolepsy symptoms or the pat ient’s reactions to them, make a difficult situation worse. Especially in Korea, where schooling is focused on college entrance exami-nations, the problem is very serious and intensified by inappro priate or delayed diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, psychiatr ists should be aware that narcolepsy in young adolescents is not rar e and that they need to be familiar with its clinical features in both its classic and less obvious forms. Narcolepsy should be suspec ted if a adolescent’s excessive sleepiness can not be explained in other ways. Therefore, we report on two patients who portray the tendency o f dull learning ability and are mistaken as idle students. We diagnosed narcolepsy through polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing. We treated the students with methylphenidate and pemolin. The students showed improvement in learning a bility and were able to adapt better to school.",

Although a few dissenting opinions have been expressed on the matter, for the most part the American public has come to view the Vietnam veteran primarily as a victim, specifically a psychiatric victim, who suffers from symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).2 PTSD is a psychological syndrome marked by intrusive recollections (nightmares or flashbacks), psychic numbing (the withdrawal from ordinary social relationships and intercourse), hyperreactivity (startle reactions to smells, sounds, or sights which remind the veteran of horrific scenes from battle in Vietnam), and related symptoms such as depression or cognitive dysfunction (e.g. the inability to concentrate). To a certain extent, PTSD is simply a restatement of diagnostic categories such as shellshock, combat fatigue, or the traumatic neuroses of war, employed to describe psychiatric victims of warfare earlier in the twentieth century. The view of both psychology and popular culture is that victims of PTSD were damaged by and continue to fixate on",

These events range from extreme high magnitude stressors such as torture, terror attacks, rape, childhood sexual abuse, natural disasters, or war to more commonly experienced stressors such as the loss of a romantic relationship, persistent physical illness, or business difficulties. Traumatic-stressor exposure is common and, for the majority of individuals exposed to stressors, normal psychological reactions that occur in the immediate aftermath will abate within days or months of the event. Posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder share the same traumatic stressor criteria involving \"exposure to a threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation\" and include direct experiencing, witnessing, or learning about a stressor.",

Serta gejala lainnya berupa merasa pesimis atau putus asa, merasa bersalah, gagal, dan sendirian, berbicara atau bergerak dengan lamban, sulit berkonsentrasi, mengingat, maupun mengambil keputusan, tidur yang lebih sedikit atau lebih banyak daripada biasanya, nafsu makan dan perubahan berat badan yang meningkat atau menurun dari biasanya, adanya pikiran atau percobaan bunuh diri minimal dalam waktu 2 minggu. Terapi yang diberikan dapat berupa obat-obatan, psikoterapi, maupun keduanya. Jika terapi tersebut tidak dapat mengurangi gejala maka dapat diberikan electroconvulsive theraphy (ECT). ECT menyebabkan berbagai efek samping seperti pusing, disorientasi, kehilangan memori. Biasanya efek samping tersebut dalam jangka pendek, namun kehilangan memori berlangsung berkepanjangan. Namun selain ECT belum ada terapi lain yang mendapat hasil secara cepat untuk terapi depresi berat dan menjadi tantangan untuk pasien yang tidak responsif terhadap ECT. Sehingga diperlukan terapi lain untuk penderita depresi berat. Ketamin merupakan obat bius non- competitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) yang digunakan untuk merawat tentara saat di medan perang. Proses pelepasan metabolit spesifik ketamin akan merangsang terjadinya peningkatan pelepasan sinaps glutamat yang menyebabkan efek antidepresan. Hal tersebut menunjukkan bahwa ketamin dapat menjadi harapan baru untuk pasien dan peneliti dalam kasus depresi berat.\r\n \r\nKata Kunci: Antidepresan, Depresi Berat, Glutamat, Ketamin",

      "title": "Long-term Cognitive Impairment after Critical Illness – Definition, Incidence, Pathophysiology and Hypothesis of Neurotrophic Treatment",
      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment after critical illness (CIACI) is a frequent consequence of serious disease or injury that has been reported in as many as 66 % of patients, 3 months after an illness requiring intensive care unit hospitalisation. The condition has been recognised only within the past 15 years and its pathological mechanisms are, as yet, incompletely understood. The neurological changes and cellular and inflammatory processes of CIACI overlap with those of stroke, traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disorders. Patients also show brain atrophy, which worsens with the duration of intensive care unit stay. Risk factors associated with CIACI include depression, biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (e.g. apolipoprotein E), delirium, exposure to some drugs (e.g. fentanyl, morphine and propofol) and intubation. Current strategies to prevent or treat CIACI include treatments to reduce agitation and delirium and physical and mental rehabilitation including cognitive therapy. Many brain diseases and injuries affect the functioning of the neurovascular unit (NVU), which constitutes the key cellular building block of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). CIACI is believed to affect the integrity of the NVU and it is among the potential targets for therapy. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs), such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are known to play an important role in neurogenesis, maintenance of NVU structure and neuronal repair after disease and injury. This led to the development of strategies including the NTF-preparation (Cerebrolysin®), which is effective as a post-stroke therapy and has potential in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and brain injury as well as CIACI. There are currently no proven treatments for CIACI; improved understanding of the condition and further evaluation of NTFs may lead to effective treatments, which are vital to tackle this increasingly serious public health problem.",

These patients typically have significant addictive, psychosomatic, and post-traumatic problems. They show a characteristic picture, now called \"alexithymia.\" This involves an impairment of the ability to recognize, name, or verbalize emotions. The effects manifest themselves mainly in mixed physiological responses, which call attention to themselves rather than to their meaning or story. These emotions, which are less useable as signals, are dedifferentiated and resomatized. There is also a type of \"operative thinking\" with marked limitations in wishfulfillment and drive-related fantasy. There is a diminution of symbolization, and with it an impairment in the capacity to elaborate the kind of fantasies that underly neuroses and the related transferences. They also have a seriously diminished emotional involvement with their objects and a lowered capacity for empathy. Lastly, there are frequently associated problems such as anhedonia, impairments in the capacities for self-care, and affect tolerance. The impediments to psychoanalytic treatment resulting from this picture are considered, and some theories of its causation and therapeutic modifications calculated to enable these patients to benefit from psychotherapy are offered.",

When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.\n\nLike seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.\n\nSeizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.\n\nBHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, …",

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

It is not enough investigated, what kind of disorders they are like, their characteristics are, and how they differ from schizoid personality disorder and continuous sluggish schizophrenia. with the aim to define the clinical features of schizotypal personality disorder 58 patients were examined. Results: • Schizotypal personality disorder is similar to deficit states, observed at schizophrenia, clinically limited to personality sphere, without the signs of flow of endogenous process and psychotic disorders. • Schizotypal personality disorder on the clinical content reminds schizoid, but insignificant ideatory disorders are typical. Dymamic of psychopathy - disposition to decompensation - is never observed. • Schizotypal personality disorder can be diagnosed as latent schizophrenia, because the clinical picture is similar. the special value acquires a dynamic aspect typical of the endogenous process. • High quality remission of schizophrenia limited of specific personality changes, as a variant of «acquired psychopathy» can be considered as clinically identical to «schizotypal personality disorder». Conclusion: A content of Schizotypal personality disorder includes a group of disorders of schizophrenia spectrum, different originally, from shizofreniform personality disorders without the signs of dynamics to the different states of development of schizophrenia - initial (latent schizophrenia), and final (high quality remission of schizophrenia as practical completion of schizophrenia process with the formation of certain features of personality).

      "title": "Functional neuroimaging: the adaptive mechanisms in migraine",
      "abstract": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by a primary brain dysfunction subtended by an episodic activation and sensitization of the trigemino-vascular pain pathway. Although migraine attacks are clinically welldefined, the underlying pathophysiology of the more complex migraine scenario is largely unknown. Functional brain changes, that occur because of repeated migraine attacks, may be explained through a maladaptive feedforward allostatic cascade model. The fundamental assumption is that “the brain is a central organ of stress” [1], able to detect stressful or potentially stressful situations and react in form of behavioural and/or physiologic responses. These brain responses, mediated by the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine mechanisms, could be either adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, allostasis is the ability to protect the body through adaptation [2]. Contrariwise, the allostatic load and overload, resulting from repeated stress and/or allostasis [3], refers to the wear and tear on the systems that normally support adaptation. Compelling evidence suggests that the brain of migraine patients is significantly different from healthy controls. Some of these differences are related to abnormal cortical activity during painful stimulations, suggesting an “adaptive” response observed in the course of moderate or high noxious trigeminal stimulations. Conversely, other differences relate to abnormality in responses that should be adaptive but become impaired or maladaptive, such as altered brainstem processing. More recently, a decreased functional connectivity was demonstrated within the fronto-parietal network (FPN) in patients with migraine without and with aura in the absence of clinically relevant executive deficits. FPN represents the neural substrate of executive functions and FPN functional abnormalities might be a part of a complex cascade that terminates in a migraine attack. Specifically, FPN functional connectivity changes could underlie a defective executive functioning in which high-demanding conditions cannot be correctly processed and solved by patients with migraine, escalating the brain adaptive response, likely resulting in a risk factor for headache attacks. In conclusion, we believe that in migraine an internal state of dysregulation creates an allostatic load with maladaptive consequences on brain, behaviour, physiological regulation and systemic physiology that progress in a feedforward cascade. Thus, we suggest that migraine should be considered a brain disease and not simply a recurrent acute pain syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Sommario L’acromegalia è una malattia sistemica con segni e sintomi caratteristici, tra cui alterazioni delle caratteristiche facciali e ingrossamento delle estremità acrali. Sebbene le alterazioni neuropsicologiche non siano storicamente associate a questa malattia, la pratica clinica ha dimostrato che sintomi psicologici possono essere presenti nei pazienti acromegalici e avere un impatto significativo sulla qualità della vita. La qualità della vita nel paziente con acromegalia è un parametro importante per definire il compenso di malattia globale ed è direttamente influenzata, oltre che dalle terapie e dalla sintomatologia clinica, anche dal quadro neuropsicologico. Ad oggi, diversi studi hanno individuato una maggiore incidenza di patologia neuropsicologica nei pazienti affetti da acromegalia; in particolare, i pazienti hanno tassi più elevati di disturbi affettivi come depressione, ansia e disturbi somatici. Inoltre, come intuibile, anche le modificazioni dell’aspetto corporeo contribuiscono a innescare disturbi di percezione del proprio corpo che, oltre ad essere debilitanti di per sé, contribuiscono al mantenimento e all’aggravarsi della patologia psicologica in generale. Inoltre, valutazioni più complete e specialistiche dal punto di vista neurocognitivo hanno dimostrato come i pazienti acromegalici soffrano anche di una diminuzione della performance cognitiva in diversi domini, peggiorando ulteriormente il quadro globale e la qualità di vita. È interessante segnalare come tutte queste problematiche dipendenti dall’effetto di GH sul sistema nervoso centrale creino delle alterazioni a lungo termine, che non regrediscono con il raggiungimento del controllo o della cura di malattia. Per questo motivo, oltre ad auspicare ulteriori studi più approfonditi per meglio comprendere l’impatto di GH e IGF1 sul quadro neuropsicologico, raccomandiamo nella pratica clinica maggiore attenzione a questo aspetto, con un approccio sempre più multidisciplinare, comprendente anche la collaborazione di neuropsicologi, psichiatri e neurologi nel team dedicato al paziente acromegalico.",

Low-level deficits are various forms of homonymous hemifield scotomata, which affect all types of vision within their borders. Intermediate-level deficits refer to impairments of colour or motion perception, which affect either one hemifield or the entire field when lesions are bilateral. High-level deficits are divided into those of the ventral (occipitotemporal) or dorsal (occipitoparietal) stream. Occipitotemporal lesions affect various aspects of object recognition, ranging from general visual agnosia to selective agnosias, such as prosopagnosia or topographagnosia from right or bilateral lesions, and pure alexia from left-sided lesions. Occipitoparietal lesions cause the various components of Bálint syndrome, namely, simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, and ocular motor apraxia. They can also cause other impairments of visuospatial or visuotemporal processing, such as astereopsis and sequence-agnosia. Because of anatomic proximity, certain deficits cluster together to form a number of cerebral visual syndromes. Treatment of these disorders remains challenging, with frequent reliance on strategic substitutions rather than restorative approaches.",

Of the various terms used to refer to this behavioral change, \"apathy\" is now the most widely used. Global hypoactivity with apathy is easy to diagnose in patients without other obvious neuropsychiatric impairments. In other clinical contexts, the diagnosis of global hypoactivity with apathy requires the physician to first establish that hypoactivity and loss of motivation cannot be more readily explained by sensorimotor impairments (e.g., as observed in patients with stroke or Parkinson's disease) or cognitive impairments (e.g., as observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease). Many criteria and behavioral scales have been used to diagnose hypoactivity with apathy. The main differential diagnosis is depression and depressive symptoms, and distinguishing between these conditions and apathy may be particularly challenging. The mechanisms of hypoactivity with apathy remain uncertain and probably involve several dysfunctions, including the inability to attach motivational values to stimuli. We reviewed the frequency, characteristics, and determinants of hypoactivity with apathy in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, across the different stages of cognitive compromise. The diagnosis of this condition is an important step in identifying the source of difficulties in patients' activities of daily living.",

      "title": "Evaluation of Syncope in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Syncope is defined as a sudden, temporary loss of consciousness associated with loss of postural tone and should be differentiated from other states of altered consciousness such as cardiac arrest, coma, narcolepsy, seizures, dizziness, and vertigo. Although multiple studies have focused on the diagnostic workup and on the prognosis of patients with syncope,1-5 data on the evaluation and outcome of elderly patients are only recently being reported.6, 7 Establishing a cause of syncope is frequently difficult. There are at least three possible reasons for the inability to define a cause of syncope. One, abnormalities causing syncope are frequently episodic or isolated events and may not be found at initial evaluation. Two, the diagnostic criteria for causes of syncope may be too stringent, leading to underdiagnosis. Three, many patients evaluated after the syncopal event may not recall the details surrounding their episode. If witnesses are not present, valuable observations are lost and the cause of syncope may not be apparent. Additionally, the evaluation of syncope in the elderly is especially more difficult because the elderly often have multiple coexisting diseases, maybe taking multiple medications, and have age-related physiologic changes that can predispose to syncope. Elderly noninstitutionalized patients have on the average 3.5 chronic diseases8 including congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disorders, all of which can predispose to syncope. Older patients are reported to take three times as many drugs as the general population,9 and many of these medications may make persons susceptible to syncope. Additionally, age-related physiologic changes may alter the normal homeostatic mechanisms maintaining blood pressure and cerebral blood flow. Baroreceptor sensitivity decreases with age and the heart rate increase in response to upright posture, exercise, cough, and hypoxia may be blunted.10, 11 Furthermore, aging results in a diminished ability of the kidneys to conserve sodium when intake is restricted and plasma renin and aldosterone responses may be diminished in the elderly, leading to difficulties in maintaining extracellular fluid balance.12 As previously emphasized,13 multiple pathologic processes together may result in syncope in the elderly and occasionally it may be difficult to specifically assign a single entity as its cause. We have recently analyzed the data from our prospective syncope study in order to compare the diagnosis and prognosis of 210 elderly patients (mean age, 71 years; range, 60 to 90 years) to 190 younger patients (mean age, 39 years; range, 14 to 59 years).6 Patients in this study were accrued from the inpatient and outpatient services of the Presbyterian-University Hospital, Pittsburgh, from April 1981 through September 1983 and all underwent a standardized diagnostic evaluation.2, 6 In our elderly patients, as noted in Table 1, initial history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (EKG) were useful in assigning a diagnosis in the majority of the patients in whom a cause could be found. Furthermore, in the elderly, diagnosis assigned by electroencephalogram, carotid massage, cardiac catheterization, cerebral angiogram, and stress test were suggested by findings on the initial history and physical examination. These results in the elderly are similar to previous studies which have shown that a careful initial history and physical examination is the most important step in the evaluation of patients with syncope.1-3 Previous studies, however, have also shown that in a substantial number of patients a cause of syncope cannot be established after the initial history, physical examination, and EKG. Prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring has assumed a central role in the evaluation of this group of patients. Although in our study6 arrhythmias were more frequently diagnosed, and prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring more often led to a diagnosis in the elderly, there are many issues regarding the use of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring that are not resolved. First, there is poor correlation between symptoms found during monitoring and concurrent electrocardiographic findings.14-16 Symptoms of dizziness or syncope during monitoring occur in 29 to 42% of patients.14-16 We have reported that a rhythm disturbance could not be identified during 75% of symptomatic periods.15 Arrhythmias may be excluded as a cause if the patient has syncope during monitoring, but no concurrent rhythm disturbance. However, most patients do not have syncope during monitoring. Therefore, presumptions regarding the cause of syncope based on asymptomatic findings are frequently necessary because of the prognostic importance and sporadic nature of the arrhythmias. However, high prevalenece of cardiac arrhythmias has been reported in asymptomatic elderly patients. Therefore, in elderly patients with syncope, it has been difficult to be certain which arrhythmias should be considered significant indicators for a potential cause of loss of consciousness. Validation of the criteria used by different investigators will be needed with long-term follow-up using recurrence of symptoms and mortality as endpoints. Second, the optimal duration of electrocardiographic monitoring has not been determined. One study suggested that patients should be continuously monitored until the symptoms recur.17 This approach is impractical and not cost-effective. We are currently evaluating the optimal duration of monitoring in patients with syncope. Third, the yield of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring is variable, showing transient arrhythmias as a potential cause of syncope in 10 to 64% of patients.18-23 Clinical predictors are needed to help identify patients more likely to have diagnostic findings. Because of the limitations of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring, electrophysiologic studies have been advocated for use in the diagnosis and management of patients with syncope.24 These studies, however, consist of invasive and expensive diagnostic tests which are useful in the evaluation of very selected subgroups of patients with syncope, such as patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause “who have underlying organic heart disease. These tests may not be practical in many elderly patients who are frail, have multiple chronic medical illnesses, and who may not be able to undergo invasive diagnostic testing. A large number of abnormalities are reported on electrophysiologic studies but the diagnostic importance of many of these in terms of a cause of syncope is not well established. Although sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia, markedly prolonged H-V interval (greater than 80 m), and markedly prolonged sinus node recovery time are important findings in patients with unexplained syncope, the clinical significance of nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, mildly prolonged H-V interval or sinus node recovery time, and induction of supraventricular tachycardia is not clear. Morbidity and mortality from syncope in the elderly may be different than the young. Injury after a fall in the elderly may have important ramifications in terms of the medical and psychological well-being of the elderly. Although there are no prior studies regarding injury due to syncope, studies on falls in the elderly reveal a higher incidence of bone fractures with advancing age.25 Approximately one-third of our patients had an injury due to a fall, but falls resulted in major trauma more frequently in the elderly. Bone fractures may be more likely to occur in the elderly because of their higher prevalence of osteoporosis. In addition, if premonitory symptoms are present, younger patients may be able to react more quickly and assume a supine or sitting position to avoid a severe injury. The mortality in our study was higher in the elderly as a reflection of deaths due to many underlying illnesses such as malignancies and pneumonia.6 In addition, more deaths in the elderly resulted from cardiovascular diseases such as chronic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular disease. Elderly patients in our study also had a higher incidence of sudden death. A multivariate analysis of our data6 revealed that patients with a cardiovascular cause of syncope are at exceedingly high risk of mortality and sudden death regardless of age. In patients with a noncardiovascular cause of syncope or syncope of unknown origin, older age, a history of congestive heart failure, and male sex were important risk factors for mortality and sudden death. Recent studies on syncope in conjunction with our study in the elderly6 provide a framework for the evaluation of elderly patients with syncope. These studies show that a careful history and physical examination will help establish many of the causes of syncope and may suggest many of the cardiac or non-cardiac causes that require further testing for definitive diagnosis. An EKG and electrocradiographic monitoring should be done in patients in whom a cause is not found on initial history and physical examination. In selected patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause who have organic heart disease, electrophysiologic studies may provide evidence for possible cause of syncope, but further studies are needed to define the risk and benefit of this test in elderly patients. Other diagnostic tests should be used selectively. Our studies have shown that nongoal-directed use of head computed tomography scan, electroencephalogram, and glucose tolerance test establish few if any causes of syncope.1, 2, 6 Elderly patients have higher morbidity and mortality than the young. A systematic and meticulous evaluation for cause of syncope in the elderly is needed in the hope of decreasing recurrences, morbidity, and the incidence of sudden death.",

      "title": "Transient Ischemic Attacks",
      "abstract": "FigureDiagnosing transient ischemic attack is not always simple or straightforward. History may help, as with many entities, but then again, it might not. A patient whose arm was numb, swollen, limp, or “dead” earlier might have actually had a motor problem. Onset of neurologic deficit is generally sudden, and deficits are typically of short duration (less than 30 minutes). Involvement of different body parts affected in succession is more characteristic of migraine or seizure. Preceding seizure may cause a post-ictal (Todd's) paralysis. One paper listed signs and symptoms likely not due to TIA: loss of consciousness, vague weakness or dizziness, mental confusion, and incontinence of urine and feces. (Lancet 1992;339:402.) Similarly, vertigo, diplopia, loss of balance, tinnitus, sensory symptoms confined to part of one limb or the face, drop attacks, and amnesia, all in isolation, are unlikely to be caused by TIA. Symptoms from multiple sclerosis typically last longer, and may be characterized by different neurologic manifestations at different times. (Ann Emerg Med 2004;43:592.) How Much Work-up is Necessary? A few remarks on definitions for a moment: The classic definition of a transient ischemic attack entails a focal neurologic symptom lasting less than 24 hours, resulting from a transient decrease in blood supply making the brain ischemic in the area producing the symptom. With advances in neuroimaging, however, especially diffusion-weighted imaging on magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to identify ischemic brain injury very early. The classic TIA implies restoration of blood flow in a timely enough way to avoid infarction. Transient neurologic symptoms lasting for more than an hour usually imply that some sort of infarction has set in, and these events should not be considered TIAs. Switching from the classic definition to a tissue-based definition would decrease the annual incidence of TIA by approximately 33 percent and increase the annual incidence of stroke by approximately seven percent. (Stroke 2003;34:919.) Diffusion-weighted imaging has the advantage of distinguishing acute infarction from chronic lesions. Some of these are very small; the mean infarct volume detected in TIA patients was less than 1 mL in one report. In fact, this has led some to distinguish transient symptoms with infarction (TSI) from transient symptoms without infarction. (Ann Neurol 2005;57:679.) Clinical TIA duration may not correlate with signal changes on diffusion-weighted imaging. Back to Basics: Why the Hurry? It doesn't make sense to perform expensive tests for an entity that has no emergency treatment and that depends on the results of these tests. (“My back has been killing me for three years. I want an MRI to see what it is once and for all.”) Certainly, it makes sense to put patients on warfarin who have atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke, and an EKG is not a time-consuming or expensive test. Symptomatic patients with greater than 70 percent carotid stenosis, on the other hand, may well derive benefit from endarterectomy. Should all patients be admitted? This is probably the question of the hour for the emergency physician. A debate on this topic appeared in Stroke. (2006;37:1137.) As noted last month, the risk of stroke may be 10 percent to 20 percent in the 90 days after TIA. Perhaps half of the risk of early stroke accrues in the first two days after TIA, however. This is hardly enough time to expect a timely outpatient work-up by a neurologist or a patient's primary care provider. Potential benefits for hospitalization include expedited work-up, opportunity for risk factor modification, monitoring patients for deterioration and possible thrombolysis and especially facilitation of early carotid artery revascularization. Carotid surgery has been shown to be most effective when performed within two weeks of the index ischemic event. (Lancet 2004;363:915.) As for medical therapy with antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) or a statin, studies to be published soon may shed some light on their efficacy in the hyperacute state after TIA or minor stroke. For patients with atrial fibrillation and TIA, the rate of stroke appears to be approximately five percent in the first two to four weeks, a figure that may not be affected by anticoagulation. (Stroke 2002;33:2722.) There is some evidence that patients with motor or speech deficits of less than 10 minutes' duration, who are over 60, or who have diabetes are at higher risk for early stroke. Clinical risk stratification models for TIA have been developed and are used in some settings. (Stroke 2006;37:1137.) Sending Some Patients Home As with other disease entities, it is useful to confirm the diagnosis of TIA, identify and treat the cause, and especially prevent a disabling or fatal vascular event. Disposition from the emergency department often will be contingent on whether the patient is stable in other ways and prompt follow-up is available. This all presupposes that the emergency physician has made an accurate diagnosis, so that the neurologist isn't trashing the EP for tying up a precious hospital bed for someone with hypoglycemia, Todd's paralysis that resolves by the time the admitting physician comes in, or some benign vestibular disorder. Some experts say brain imaging for the most part can be performed on an outpatient basis, as can carotid scanning and echocardiography, perhaps even in a timely way. (Stroke 2006;37:1139.) Patients do not need to be in the hospital to be taught the value of exercise and cessation of smoking. They can certainly be started on any statin, diuretic, or ACE inhibitor without being hospitalized. Then there are the dangers of being in the hospital at all for anyone: exposure to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, risk of deep venous thrombosis, and deconditioning from being confined to a hospital bed. At any rate, many patients with TIA and normal imaging on diffusion-weighted imaging do well. One study of 83 consecutive patients listed th incidence of recurrent cerebral ischemic event after approximately 13 months at 30 percent if infarction was present, but only 14 percent if no infarction was present on diffusion-weighted imaging. (Stroke 2004;35:2313.) More convincingly, in a case series of 57 patients presenting with TIA, the rate of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients who had TIA with infarction during their hospital stay (3 to 5 days) was 14.8 percent, while no recurrent or new stroke occurred in patients with TIA and normal imaging. (Cerebrovasc Dis 2002;14:177.) The Bottom Lines There will be ongoing debate about how TIA should be defined and what technology is needed to determine whether a TIA actually occurred. From our perspective, there are some therapies which may prevent stroke and enough science to justify testing. It certainly adds more value to prevent neurologic deficit than to hospitalize someone after a CVA for rehabilitation purposes. There is a dearth of evidence on exactly what to do with the TIA patient in the emergency department. Patients with clear neurologic deficits such as aphasia or hemiparesis may be at higher risk than those with sensory events or vertigo. TIA work-up clearly lends itself to a brief hospital observation stay. Because the persistent concern is for tight carotid stenosis requiring revascularization, the case could be made for sending TIA patients home as long as their carotid arteries have been evaluated. Clearly, the last word has not been issued about whether all TIAs should be admitted. The fact that there has been a debate published this year (pro and con) in the stroke literature attests to this. In fact, the con position in the debate over hospitalization for TIAs was held by a geriatrician who works in a national health service country (Australia). If he thinks he can get a timely work-up there, surely we might be able to do so in the U.S. EMN on the Web Looking for Dr. James Roberts' article on kidney stones?

      "title": "[Depression: longer-lasting episode not an automatic indication for referral].",
      "abstract": "During episodes of depression, patients exhibit a low mood and a number of other emotional and/or physical symptoms for a certain period of time. Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

      "title": "Muerte encefálica: fisiopatología y neuropatología",
      "abstract": "Brain death is at present the accepted criterion to establish the diagnosis of death in all medical aspects and in public opinion. It implies the irreversible destruction of the brain with associated loss of spontaneous breathing and persistent cardiac rhythm. Brain death forms the basis of the Uniform Death Determination Act. Brain death may follow head trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, child abuse or chocking. In 1959, the concept of coma depasse (irreversible coma) was introduced based on 23 cases with loss of consciousness, of brain stem reflexes, spontaneous breathing, isoelectric EEG, and massive necrosis of the brain, all of which led to define the concept of irreversible coma as brain death. Due to clinical similarities the locked-in syndrome, GuillainBarre-Strohl peripheral neuropathy, accidental hypothermia, alcoholic intoxication, overdose of anesthetics, barbiturates, addictive drugs, antidepressants, and trauma must be considered in the differential diagnoses prior to diagnosis of brain death. The brain energetic requirements to maintain normal function depend on the constant flow of oxygen and glucose. Blood flow, blood perfusion pressure, intracranial pressure, blood viscosity, vascular resistance, and capillary density, are also participant factors. In cardiac arrest the oxygen drops to zero level with ensuing global brain death. Oxygen deficit in atmospheric air leading to hypoxia, induces brain lesions of varied topography obeying level of neuronal activity, intensity and duration of the hypoxia. Brain areas susceptible to oxygen and glucose deficits include the hippocampal pyramidal layer, neocortical layers3, 4, 5, cerebellar Purkinje and granular layers, Globus pallidus, and subcortical white matter. The peculiar susceptibility of brain areas to damage by hypoxia is based on the theory of pathoclisis or selective” topistic” vulnerability. Neuronal necrosis in ischemic hypoxia is due to glutamate excitotoxicity acting upon NMDA, AMPA, kainate and metabotropic receptors. Besides neuronal necrosis, programmed cell death also occurs, it is a morphological change named apoptosis. It occurs in sequential stages beginning by cell shrinkage, nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation, cytoplasm surface blebbing and extrusion of membrane bound apoptotic bodies. Cascading molecular events to apoptosis include signaling pathways to initiate apoptosis, control and integration, a common-execution phase, and removal of dead cells by phagocytosis. Mitochondrial permeability to release cytochrome c an apoptotic trigger into the cytosol, and gene participation ensue. Bcl-2, Bax, Bad, BclX, Apaf-1, p53; all are genes encoding proteins that may exert pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic actions. Conclusion: In clinical practice, in order to avoid any doubts, confirmatory laboratory tests are required as proof of the clinical diagnosis of brain death, which once firmly established leads to declare that the patient is dead, followed by unplugging mechanical ventilation. All of this must be in agreement with the bioethical, legal, and religious regulations and family consent.",

Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

      "abstract": "Myoclonic jerks are sudden shock–like involuntary movements, either manifesting as a brief contraction of a group of muscles (positive) or cessation of muscle activity (negative), driven by aberrant activity in one of the cortex, subcortical regions, brainstem or spinal cord. Its aetiology is variable and can occur physiologically, in a primary myoclonic syndrome (myoclonus–dystonia), or as part of an epilepsy (Progressive myoclonic epilepsy) or neurodegenerative syndrome (Alzheimer9s disease, multiple systems atrophy). Myoclonus can also occur secondary to hypoxic brain injury either in an acute (myoclonic status epilepticus) or a chronic form, eponymously titled Lance–Adams syndrome (LAS). LAS is characterised by a non–progressive generalised myoclonus with added seizures and ataxia. There is no curative management strategy, only symptomatic relief. A multidisciplinary approach involving medical, physiotherapy, speech and occupational therapy achieves the best holistic outcomes for patients. Case studies suggest certain antiepileptic agents may alleviate symptoms, but combinations are often required, and the most effective options have sedative side effects. A subset of cases have marked alcohol responsiveness that can lead to dependence. A number of experimental treatment options have been proposed including deep brain stimulation (DBS) and sodium oxybate, a sodium salt of gamma–Hydroxybutyrate. In what follows, a patient with an eleven year history of the LAS is presented and the experimental therapeutics explored, concluding with a recent trial of sodium oxybate. Sodium oxybate was well tolerated and produced improvements in the patient9s symptoms and perceived disability. This case highlights the difficulties of managing chronic myoclonic conditions and suggests sodium oxybate may be a useful treatment option in these patients.",

In approximately 15%, impairment is believed to stem from undetected yet potentially reversible underlying causes. Another 20 to 25% are estimated to have contributing conditions for which some form of therapeutic intervention other than symptomatic treatment is important. Common, potentially reversible causes of dementia include medication toxicity, depression, metabolic or infectious disorders, brain trauma and disease, and environmental and psychosocial elements. Early investigation of confusion and other symptoms of delirium or dementia is urgent because permanent injury to brain cells may occur, or because an undetected reversible disorder may worsen a chronic condition. Nursing interventions should promote early detection, prevention and treatment of reversible causes of dementia.",

Central nervous system disorders are a group of neurological disorder that affect the structure or function of the brain or spinal cord. Depression (major depressive disorder or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. The aim of treatment is release of neurotrophic proteins in the brain that can help to rebuild the hippocampus that has been reduced due to depression and to optimize patients’ physical, psychological and social functioning.

      "title": "Force Maintenance With Submaximal Fatiguing Contractions",
      "abstract": "Whereas many definitions of fatigue include externally measurable decrements in force or performance, fatigue can be present with no change in the external output of the muscle. The maintenance of submaximal forces can be considered a compromise between neuromuscular force enhancement and competing inhibitory influences. An example of a muscle facilitatory process includes postactivation potentiation that results in an increased sensitivity to Ca ++ . The neuromuscular system copes with metabolic disruption and subsequent loss of force by recruiting additional motor units and increasing the firing frequency. If the contraction persists, firing frequency may decrease so as to optimize the stimulus rate with the prolonged duration of the muscle fibre action potential (muscle wisdom). The insertion of additional neural impulses into the train of stimuli can result in force potentiation (catch-like properties). Furthermore, there is evidence of neural potentiation and a dissociation of muscle activity with submaximal fatigue. Conversely, inhibition may be derived supraspinally or at the spinal level. While there may be some evidence of intrinsic motoneuronal fatigue, inhibitory afferent influences from chemical, tensile, pressure, and other factors play an important role in the competing influences on force output. Key words: postactivation potentiation, recruitment, rate coding, inhibition, catch-like properties",

      "abstract": "Memory is the ability of an individual to record sensory stimuli, events, information, etc., retain them over short or long periods of time and recall the same at a later date when needed. Poor Memory, lower retention and slow recall and are common problems in today’s stressful and competitive world. Age, stress, emotions are conditions that may led to memory loss, amnesia, anxiety, high blood pressure, dementia, to more ominous threat like schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s diseases. After many centuries of use in Eastern medicine, doctors agree that some herbs do effectively enhance memory. You can use herbs one at a time or in a blend to enhance your memory. Ayurveda, the ancient science of life has more than one reference of the plant for the enhancement of memory and mental agility of mankind. The famous Charaka Samhita written in the 1st century refers Brahmi (nerve tonic), a perennial creeping plant (Bacopa monnieri) for curing mental retardation leading to psychosis. Pharmacological properties of this plant have been clearly mentioned as having properties of cognitive enhancement and anxiolytic effect. The other treatise Sushruta Samhita makes this more explicit and describes Brahmi to be effective in memory loss. This herb is also helps you to cure the unrelieved disorders, nervous breakdown, insomnia and pin. This herb is also effective in controlling the cholesterol level in the body. This herb is also deals with the urinary problems as well. Bacopa is very profitable to sharpen your memory, intelligence longevity, anti-aging and also helps you to reduce stress. This herb is also very beneficial to boost the coordination between the neurons and brain.",

      "abstract": "Seizures and epilepsy commonly occur in patients with organ system failure, either as a consequence of trophic effects on cerebral function or of therapies used in such conditions. Acute organ failure results in an abrupt, but often reversible, lowering of seizure threshold, whereas chronic organ failure results in more pervasive and indolent cerebral compromise, often permanently altering both the seizure threshold and the physiologic responses to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Failure of an organ system is not typically a sudden, all-or-none phenomenon but occurs in stages with variable susceptibility to seizures as the condition worsens or remits. Although the principles of diagnosis and management of seizures in adult and pediatric patients with a specific organ dysfunction are similar, the underlying etiologies and influences of comorbid conditions differ between adults and children. Adult organ failure often involves multiple systems to different extents and is superimposed on other chronic diseases of adulthood. Pediatric organ failure is usually the result of inherited metabolic disorders, infections, and unique pediatric susceptibilities to metabolic effects of medications (Table 1).",

The results of traumatic events on emotional state or behavior of child may be short term or long term, anyway they affect development. Events like natural disasters, wars, rapes are traumatic for all people, but chlidren may almost equally be affected by separation, abusing, divorce, death of parents and testifying against abusers or parents. Posttraumatic stress disorder is the most recognizable manifestation of state caused by trauma. Traumatic event is relived on different ways: through frequently recalling events and flashbacks of that experience, avoiding of situations related with trauma, appearing of general insensitivity, that manifests as losing of interests for important activities, impossibilty of emotional binding and sense of isolation from others. The simptomes of posttraumatic disorder are: increased arousal, irritability, anxiety, difficulties with concentration, overemphasized shock. Quality relationship parent-child, support that child had in family before the traumatic experience and current support from social surroundings may be protection factors and prevent occurrence and advancemenet of negative trauma effects.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are particularly common presentations in primary care settings. They lie on a severity spectrum, with significant overlaps with other functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses like depression and anxiety, and general medical conditions. Typically, symptoms present with either no identifiable medical aetiology, or are disproportionate to the cause, with associated distress and preoccupations, health-related anxiety, and help-seeking behaviours. Cultural factors are known to shape shared mental representations about interpreting such symptom experiences and are therefore vital determinants of health and illness reporting. The nosology of MUS has been debated, deliberated, and transformed several times over the last century. Several models have been proposed to understand the pathogenesis of MUS based on the complex interaction of developmental, personality, cognitive–perceptual, cultural, and emotional processes within a bio-psycho-socio-cultural framework. Effective and sensitive communication of socio-culturally grounded and individualized illness formulations that link the individual’s belief systems, diagnosis, and treatment options are key to managing MUS. Medications are used to treat severe symptoms or comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Psychotherapy that targets coping, help-seeking behaviours, and real-world functioning is also effective.",

It should be differentiated from occasional drug use, from drug abuse with minor consequences as well from medical drug dependency in which the individual does not seek a psychological effect. Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief.

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "abstract": "For the purpose of this paper, the term disability will encompass the following impairments: disability that can increase vulnerability to abuse resulting from physical, sensory, or mental impairments, or a combination of impairments; physical disability resulting from injury (e.g., spinal cord injury, amputation), chronic disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), or congenital conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy); sensory impairments consisting of hearing or visual impairments; and mental impairments comprising developmental conditions (e.g., mental retardation), cognitive impairment (e.g., traumatic brain injury), or mental illness. Emotional abuse is being threatened, terrorized, severely rejected, isolated, ignored, or verbally attacked. Physical abuse is any form of violence against one’s body, such as being hit, kicked, restrained, or deprived of food or water. Sexual abuse is being forced, threatened, or deceived into sexual activities ranging from looking or touching to intercourse or rape.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric emergencies faced by adolescents are often linked to developmental issues such as separating from parents, establishing attachments to peers, and developing autonomy. In a vulnerable adolescent, a stressful developmental event may trigger a pathological response--acute anxiety, depression with or without suicidal ideation or behavior, severe conduct disturbance, a first psychotic episode, or explosive or violent behavior--that requires emergency psychiatric treatment. The basic components of an emergency psychiatric evaluation of an adolescent include initial observation of the patient, taking a history, interviewing the patient and others accompanying the patient, conducting a mental status examination, making a diagnosis, and planning for disposition and further treatment. Such an evaluation may be the first contact with the mental health system for many adolescents, and the intervention of a sensitive clinician may help the adolescent be more comfortable seeking mental health care in the future.",

      "abstract": "Psychological trauma is caused by an extreme event that occurs unexpectedly and suddenly, is life-threatening or is perceived to be so, and has an intense impact on the senses of the person involved. A wide range of reactions, responses and emotions can be brought forth by such experiences. Reactions directly following the event can be characterized as shock. Such reactions might include a feeling that nothing is real, emotional apathy and confusion, as well as physical responses such as trembling, shivering or nausea. Children often react differently than adults. For this reason, adults do not always understand the connection between the child's behavior and the traumatic experience. For instance, depressed children are often active and restless, while depressed adults are sluggish and move at a slower speed. Moreover, children suffer from extreme mood swings, from jubilant at the one extreme to deeply sorrowful.",

Este potencial adaptativo del sistema nervioso permite al cerebro reponerse a trastornos o lesiones, y puede reducir los efectos de alteraciones estructurales producidas por patologías como lo es la enfermedad del Alzheimer. La enfermedad de Alzheimer es una enfermedad cerebral que ocasiona problemas relacionados con la memoria, el pensamiento y el comportamiento. No es una parte normal del envejecimiento. El Alzheimer empeora con el tiempo aunque los síntomas pueden variar mucho. El primer problema que muchas personas notan es el olvido lo suficientemente grave como para afectar su capacidad para funcionar en el hogar o en el trabajo, o para disfrutar de pasatiempos permanentes. La estimulación cognitiva es un conjunto de procedimientos muy útiles para estimular los mecanismos de la neuroplasticidad y con ello detener el avance de la demencia, así como mejorar la calidad de vida del paciente y de su familia.",

Udowodniono, że dysfunkcje seksualne występują u osób chorujących na SM często. Dysfunkcje te występują częściej niż w przypadku pacjentów cierpiących na inne przewlekłe choroby – 70% pacjentów ze stwardnieniem rozsianym dotkniętych jest problemami w sferze seksualnej. Patofizjologia tych zaburzeń jest wieloczynnikowa. Jednym z czynników są uszkodzenia w centralnym układzie nerwowym, innym współistniejące zaburzenia niezwiązane bezpośrednio z obszarami demielizacyjnymi, takie jak: zmęczenie, spastyczność, osłabienie siły mięśni czy skutki uboczne wdrożonej w procesie leczenia farmakoterapii. Należy podkreślić, że część dysfunkcji seksualnych u osób z SM ma podłoże psychologiczne i społeczne.

Some patients experience seizures, which may increase in severity with subsequent AW episodes. Another potential AW complication is delirium tremens, characterized by hallucinations, mental confusion, and disorientation. Cognitive impairment and delirium may lead to a chronic memory disorder (i.e., Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome). Psychiatric problems associated with withdrawal include anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. In addition, alterations in physiology, mood, and behavior may persist after acute withdrawal has subsided, motivating relapse to heavy drinking. Recent advances in neurobiology may support the development of improved medications to decrease the risk of AW complications and support long-term sobriety.",

      "abstract": "A broader palette of safe and better-tolerated agents is available for treating people suffering from chronic schizophrenia, depressive disorders, anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorders. However, current medical treatments are still only partially effective, and highly-prevalent psychiatric disorders continue to represent a huge personal and socio-economic burden. Most pharmacological agents sometimes induce a variety of severe movement disorders, including dystonia or dyskinesia, with an acute, subacute or more chronic time course. More extensive cerebral condition, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome or the serotonin syndrome may be induced by antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Medications commonly involve dopamine receptor blockers, antidepressants and anti-epileptics, among many others. Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia [1]. The traditional and atypical neuroleptics sometimes induce dystonic reactions, akathisia, parkinsonism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, tremor, hyperkinesia and movement disorders [1]. A better understanding of the impact of these drug-induced adverse effects may provide new strategies to develop novel neuroleptics with less adverse metabolic effects and to develop complementary medical therapies to patients treated with antipsychotic medication [2]. The lack of success in discovering more effective pharmacotherapy has contributed, together with many other factors, to a relative few useful findings on new drug targets for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Stress factors in elderly have their particularity. Anxiety states in elderly can develop in response to factors that wouldn’t cause mental disorders in a young persons. The most common chronic factors in elderly are lonely dwelling, change of life conditions and financial losses, diminished capacity of self-serving, helplessness and living in dependence of other people because of somatic diseases. Among acute stress factors could be mentioned on interrupted association with relatives, moving to a new place, had planned hospitalization and surgical treatment. Clinical picture of mixed anxiety and depressive disorder in elderly has its particularity. It is characterized by impairment of emotional and will functions expressed in depressive mood, fear, anxiety assessment of future. These factors lead to forming pathological motivation of behavior, accompanied by feeling of helplessness, uncertainty in abilities. Cognitive functions are also disturbed, especially in case of comorbide organic emotionally labile disorder of vascular genesis. In such cases symptoms of both disorders enforce each other. Firstly, attentive functions are disturbed because of fixation on unreal problems, connected with anxiety apprehensions. Voluntary memory is also reduced, especially on recent events. Although mixed anxiety and depressive disorder has a mild level of severity, it is accompanied with disturbance of critical functions. It has a great influence on persons’ capacity to make decisions and on level of social functioning.",

However, a generally accepted understanding and clear definition of what is constituted by psychological pain do not exist. Morse and colleagues' criteria (definition, characteristics, boundaries, preconditions, outcomes) were used to analyze related concepts (suffering, psychache, emotional pain, and psychic pain) that could contribute to a definition of psychological pain. The analysis indicated that psychological pain may best be defined as a lasting, unsustainable, and unpleasant feeling resulting from negative appraisal of an inability or deficiency of the self. This negative self-appraisal is typically brought on by loss of someone or something, or failure to achieve something that is intimately linked to core psychological needs.",

The locked-in syndrome is characterised by preservation of consciousness with dissociation between automatic and volitional control of lower cranial nerve and limb function. Minimally conscious state is characterised by inconsistent but reproducible responses above the level of spontaneous or reflex behaviour, which indicates some degree of interaction with surroundings. Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome is characterised by complete absence of behavioural evidence for self or environmental awareness.

      "abstract": "Naturally occurring memory processes show features which are difficult to investigate by conventional cognitive neuroscience paradigms. Distortions of memory for problematic contents are described both by psychoanalysis (internal conflicts) and research on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; external traumata). Typically, declarative memory for these contents is impaired - possibly due to repression in the case of internal conflicts or due to dissociation in the case of external traumata - but they continue to exert an unconscious pathological influence: neurotic symptoms or psychosomatic disorders after repression or flashbacks and intrusions in PTSD after dissociation. Several experimental paradigms aim at investigating repression in healthy control subjects. We argue that these paradigms do not adequately operationalize the clinical process of repression, because they rely on an intentional inhibition of random stimuli (suppression). Furthermore, these paradigms ignore that memory distortions due to repression or dissociation are most accurately characterized by a lack of self-referential processing, resulting in an impaired integration of these contents into the self. This aspect of repression and dissociation cannot be captured by the concept of memory as a storage device which is usually employed in the cognitive neurosciences. It can only be assessed within the framework of a constructivist memory concept, according to which successful memory involves a reconstruction of experiences such that they fit into a representation of the self. We suggest several experimental paradigms that allow for the investigation of the neural correlates of repressed memories and trauma-induced memory distortions based on a constructivist memory concept.",

      "abstract": "Disability after severe closed head injury (CHI) differs from that of penetrating trauma or other causes of more focal cerebral damage, but its symptoms can be understood in terms of the pathophysiology and the usual pathology of CHI. Outcome can be quantified by means of specific, narrowly-defined measures, which may fail to reflect other serious sequelae, or by means of functional rating scales, which bear little logical relation to CHI pathophysiology and lump together patients with diverse deficits. The choice of appropriate intake measures of CHI severity in turn depends on which aspects of outcome are to be determined. As the cardinal symptom of CHI is altered consciousness, logical intake measures of CHI severity include measures of the depth and the duration of the abnormal state of consciousness. Confounding factors in outcome prediction include secondary complications of CHI, premorbid characteristics, and effects of acute and rehabilitative therapy. Most research has focused on functional outcome predictions based on simple intake measures obtained shortly after injury, but intake measures that permit accurate prediction of rehabilitation potential or of specific cognitive and behavioral outcomes are also needed.",

      "abstract": "There is little written in the geriatric literature about the concept of psychological frailty which encompasses cognitive, mood, and motivational components. The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Concussion is defined as a biomechanically induced brain injury characterized by the absence of gross anatomic lesions. Early and late clinical symptoms, including impairments of memory and attention, headache, and alteration of mental status, are the result of neuronal dysfunction mostly caused by functional rather than structural abnormalities. The mechanical insult initiates a complex cascade of metabolic events leading to perturbation of delicate neuronal homeostatic balances. Starting from neurotoxicity, energetic metabolism disturbance caused by the initial mitochondrial dysfunction seems to be the main biochemical explanation for most postconcussive signs and symptoms. Furthermore, concussed cells enter a peculiar state of vulnerability, and if a second concussion is sustained while they are in this state, they may be irreversibly damaged by the occurrence of swelling. This condition of concussion‐induced brain vulnerability is the basic pathophysiology of the second impact syndrome. N ‐acetylaspartate, a brain‐specific compound representative of neuronal metabolic wellness, is proving a valid surrogate marker of the post‐traumatic biochemical damage, and its utility in monitoring the recovery of the aforementioned “functional” disturbance as a concussion marker is emerging, because it is easily detectable through proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.",

In ideal circumstances, this can be diagnosed in a clinical sensory examination as a decrease or total loss of sensation of one or several sensory modalities within the affected nerve distribution. While the negative symptoms and signs of hypoesthesia are essential for the diagnosis of a neuropathy, some patients also develop one or more positive sensory signs including pain, allodynia, paraesthesia, and hyperesthesia. Within the trigeminal distribution, these positive phenomena may severely interfere with vital and socially important functions, e.g. mimics, eating, speaking, teeth brushing, and kissing. The sensory hypoesthesia caused by sensory nerve fibre damage may be so subtle, however, that it cannot be detected in the rather crude clinical sensory examination.",

However, such declines must not be accepted as indisputable evidence that the learning efficiency of older adults is necessarily impaired.

However, a number of noncognitive factors such as functional and pathological sensory deficits, psychomotor slowing, poor physical and mental health, and insufficient or excessively high motivation also mitigate against optimal performance in the aged. The learning efficiency of the aged may be improved through the use of teaching and learning techniques designed to compensate for the negative effects of both detrimental cognitive and noncognitive factors.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

Panic attacks are one of the most typical examples of somatizations: they are characterized by a focusing of attention towards physiological arousal signals and by a pathological interpretation of them as indicating an imminent danger or a serious sickness. Regular physical activity is associated with decreasing somatization, probably through adaptive mechanisms of serotonergic circuits implicated in anxiety and nociception regulation.",

      "abstract": "Fear and anxiety are common and basic human experiences. Fear is pathological if it occurs disproportionately frequently and excessively, i.e. without adequate, real threat. When anxiety occurs too often, a patient loses control over it and tends to avoid situations and is thus restricted in his/her everyday life. The most important forms of anxiety disorders in psychosomatic primary care are panic disorder, agoraphobia and generalised anxiety disorder. Very often anxiety symptoms are hidden by physical symptoms. Basic psychosocial interventions include strengthening autonomy, explaining the vicious circle of fear and also relaxation techniques (breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation). The core features of obsessive compulsive disorder are obsessions (intrusive, unwanted thoughts) and compulsions (performance of highly ritualized behaviours intended to neutralise the negative thoughts and emotions resulting from the obsessions).",

      "abstract": "Un fenomeno frecuente y de dificil tratamiento en los pacientes psiquiatricos es el dano fisico directo e intencional causado por conductas autolesivas que no se efectuan con una finalidad suicida. La conducta se puede presentar eventualmente en padecimientos psiquiatricos como estados depresivos o psicoticos. Sin embargo, cuando se presenta de manera frecuente, constituye lo que se denomina el sindrome de autolesion deliberada que se puede observar en pacientes con retraso mental y trastornos de personalidad. Este trabajo sustenta una implicacion de las estructuras limbicas que procesan el componente cognoscitivo-afectivo del dolor en el desarrollo del comportamiento autolesivo (CAL). Proponemos que el CAL resulta de una disfuncion en la percepcion nociceptiva, particularmente en los mecanismos de alto orden de procesamiento, donde se integra el dolor como una experiencia consciente y se conceptua como sensacion desagradable. Suponemos que esta alteracion en la percepcion nociceptiva puede considerarse como una consecuencia, manifestacion o sintoma, de una anomalia en la percepcion de si mismo. La alteracion en la percepcion nociceptiva y en la percepcion de si mismo, resultaria, en algunos casos, de la incidencia de factores ambientales desfavorables en personas biologicamente vulnerables, mientras que en otros, seria la anomalia biologica la determinante de la conducta. Se ha encontrado una asociacion entre la incapacidad de reconocer estimulos nociceptivos y la presencia de fenomenos disociativos. Esto ejemplifica la forma en que una respuesta altamente especializada y adaptativa en sujetos sanos ante condiciones amenazantes podria originar, de manera paradojica, conductas poco adaptativas. Los sujetos expuestos de manera cronica a situaciones amenazantes en edades tempranas, son susceptibles de desarrollar un patron de respuesta patologico que podria poner en riesgo su vida.",

Cette dernière peut constituer la cause du retard des acquisitions (encéphalopathie épileptogène) ou bien n'être qu'une traduction supplémentaire conséquence d'une pathologie neurologique sous jacente commune (encéphalopathie avec épilepsie). Elle n'est alors pas seule responsable du retard. Dans le cadre des encéphalopathies avec épilepsie une démarche diagnostique rigoureuse est nécessaire avec notamment un examen cutané (syndromes neuro‐cutanés), un examen moteur (séquelles anoxo‐ischémiques de la période périnatale), un EEG, une imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM) cérébrale ainsi que la recherche d'anomalies associées (cardiaque, rénale…). D'autre part il existe des encéphalopathies épileptogènes telles que les syndromes liés à l'âge : syndrome hémiconvulsions, hémiplégie, épilepsie (HHE) ; syndrome de Rasmussen, épilepsie myoclonique sévère du nourrisson (syndrome de Dravet), épilepsie myoclono‐astatique (Doose) que nous développerons comme exemples. L'âge, le type de crises et l'EEG sont utiles pour le diagnostic dans ce cas, les autres examens étant généralement peu contributifs. Retard et épilepsie sont souvent associés et la première étape du diagnostic est d'essayer de comprendre si l'épilepsie est une cause active du désordre cognitif ou non, afin d'affiner la démarche étiologique mais aussi d'adapter la prise en charge thérapeutique.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) could be defined as an insult to the brain caused by an external force producing altered states of consciousness that result in impaired cognitive or physical functions. TBI, especially if severe, can produce structural and functional modifications of the brain, which in turn can result in a highly variable and complex interaction of symptoms depending on the motor, sensory, cognitive, emotional, behavioural, and autonomic spheres. The brain during traumatic collision is prone to insults due to a complex combination of acceleration and deceleration and translation and rotation forces causing contusions, diffuse axonal injuries (DAI), and haemorrhages. Moreover, damages to neurons may occur as a consequence of biochemical modifications as a consequence of a drop in the levels of oxygen and glucose, and, finally, because of blood hypotension or increased intracranial pressure. This complex combination of and interaction among insults tends to produce a heterogeneous association of diffused and focalized damages that affect every possible area of the brain: cortical, subcortical, and midbrain. In addition, mild TBI can produce cerebral damage whose severity is directly correlated with the length of loss of consciousness and of post-traumatic amnesia",

As a rule, late-life depression afflicts medically ill, disabled persons living under chronic stress and/or isolation. Symptoms and signs of medical illnesses and behavioral limitations from disability are often difficult to distinguish from depressive symptomatology. Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next. Clinical subpopulations of late-life depression — psychotic depression, dysthymic disorder, depression associated with an adverse life event, treatment-resistant depression, and residual symptoms of depression — require special attention.",

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

      "abstract": "Personality disorders are a class of mental diseases characterized by inflexible and maladaptive patterns of behavior, cognition, and inner experience, involving several areas of functioning, such as affectivity, impulse control, ways of perceiving and thinking and reaction to stress factors. In the literature, personality disorders have always been described as stable patterns of long duration, and their onset can be found during adolescence or early adulthood. These patterns are associated with significant distress or impairment in a patient's life in which a main element affects every aspect of living, and in which no biological or other pathologies exist to assist in its identification. Therefore, they often lead to comorbidities such as dysfunctional anxiety, drug abuse, major depression and suicide.We present a case of a 37-year-old man, who came to the outpatient department needing support to quit smoking. During the follow up, he described some transitory changes in his personality while watching football (soccer) games. These episodes were characterized by inappropriate anger crises, rapid and dramatic shifts in emotional tone, dysphoria and superstitious and magical beliefs with paranoid elements; connecting himself, his family and friends to players in the match and to the unfolding of the game. Every manifestation was induced by the football match, and there were no signs of difficulty in handling impulses and in managing relationships, or any superstitious beliefs, outside of it.The combination of all the symptoms led us to think about a diagnosis of the borderline personality disorder. There was a lack of managing impulsivity, intense uncontrollable emotional reactions, and episodes of psychotic decompensation with unreal and paranoid connections made between the patient's entourage and the results of the match.With this case, we propose to consider the personality disorder, not just as a stable and inflexible pattern, but also as a transitory dysfunction induced by stress factors, as in this case, a football match, introducing therefore a new entity: transient personality disorder.",

Forensic Neuropsychology establishes an expert valuation of the brain-injured patient (or supposed), or of the law offender people (or supposed) requiring law protection due to their illness. This discipline has a fundamental role in the study of cerebral organic syndromes, particularly in the dementias. DEVELOPMENT. The demential syndrome is common to a group of diseases as degenerative or cardiovascular disorders, brain tumors, syphilis, alcoholism or toxic factors, etc. When speaking of dementia we refer to a syndrome characterized by a progressive and global deterioration of the cognitive functions (memory, language, attention, space-temporal orientation, praxis, thinking, etc.) with preservation of the level of conscience (DSM-IV). This symptomatology affects the personality of the individual as reasonable being , as well as to his behavior and social adaptation. The decrease or loss of the intellectual and volitives abilities of the affected person of a demential syndrome, if it is permanent, also implies a change in its legal situation, since its legal capacity is altered. Therefore, it will be necessary to adopt protective measures for his person and his patrimony. Even if it is necessary, to promote a process of disability, whose sentence will be emitted by a judge, who will indicate: the degree of the mentioned disability, the trusteeship regime and who is designated as a legal tutor.",

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of uncertainty in illness of patients is discussed and analyzed in this article. Uncertainty in illness is a condition that accompanies the patient from the moment of appearance of the first somatic symptoms of the disease and could be strengthened or weakened thanks to many psychosocial factors. The level of uncertainty is related to the level of stress, emotional disadaptation, affective states, coping strategies, mechanisms of psychological defense, etc. Uncertainty can perform destructive functions, acting as a trigger for stressful conditions and launching negative emotional experiences. As a positive function of uncertainty, one can note a possible positive interpretation of the patient's disease. In addition, the state of uncertainty allows the patient to activate the resources of coping with the disease, among which the leading role belongs to social support.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is one of several disruptive psychotic disorders characterized by a broad mix of symptoms such as perceptual anomalies like hallucinations, thought distortions like delusions, disorganized speech and behaviors, and various negative symptoms such as muted expressiveness. The illness affects approximately 1% of the population. It usually begins in late adolescence or early adulthood and causes significant difficulties in cognition and affect at work, in social relationships, and in self-care. Its course varies across individuals, with many patients’ symptoms responding to medicine. There are many theories of the disorder’s pathophysiology, with several mechanisms invoked to account for evidence ranging from impaired performance on neuropsychological tests to brain structure, function, and neurotransmitter alterations such as in the dopamine, glutamate, and GABA systems. The etiology of schizophrenia is complex, with both genetic and environmental risk factors. While there exist other psychotic syndromes with a number of similarities, schizophrenia can be understood as a severe, persistent, and debilitating mental illness that still requires a more thorough investigation of its causal mechanisms to improve patients’ lives.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in all sections of the population and are either the main clinical complaint or a frequent complication of many conditions for which patients are seen in primary care or specialist services. However, the subject is poorly covered in medical education. A major consequence is that the manifestations of the many sleep disorders now identified are likely to be misinterpreted as other clinical conditions of a physical or psychological nature, especially neurological or psychiatric disorders. To illustrate this problem, examples are provided of the various possible causes of sleep loss, poor quality sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of disturbed behaviour at night (parasomnias). All of these sleep disorders can adversely affect mental state and behaviour, daytime performance or physical health, the true cause of which needs to be recognised by clinicians to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. As conventional history taking in neurology and psychiatry pays little attention to sleep and its possible disorders, suggestions are made concerning the enquiries that could be included in history taking schedules to increase the likelihood that sleep disorders will be correctly identified.",

According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, parasomnias are distinguished on the basis of the stage of sleep in which they appear: (1) parasomnias arising from NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep, which include arousal disorders (confusional arousal, sleep terror, sleepwalking) and sleep-related eating disorders; (2) parasomnias associated with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep; and (3) “other parasomnias” occurring in any sleep stage (eg, sleep enuresis, exploding head syndrome).

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V menghapus diagnosis untuk skizofrenia simpleks, namun dalam Pedoman Penggolongan Diagnostik Gangguan Jiwa (PPDGJ) III dan International and Classification Diseases (ICD)-10 masih disertakan. Studi kasus ini membahas pasien yang didiagnosis skizofrenia simpleks dengan diagnosis pembandingnya episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik. Seorang laki-laki bernama AY, berusia 28 tahun, dan tidak tamat sekolah dasar tidak memiliki figur ayah. Klien AY pernah bekerja secara wajar serta menyukai lawan jenis. Kemunduran fungsi psikologis kemudian terjadi. Simtom negatif dari skizofrenia pada AY sangat menonjol, yaitu sedikit berbicara, afek datar, menarik diri dari pergaulan sosial, minat dan ambisi kurang, dan dorongan vitalitas rendah. AY memiliki ide atau pikiran-pikiran bahwa dirinya bersalah, berdosa, dan memandang sesuatu tampak kotor sehingga terdapat perilaku mencuci yang berulang-ulang. Hasil integrasi tes psikologi menjukkan tanda-tanda patologis, yaitu depresi, cemas berlebihan, dan gangguan afek. Dinamika psikologi AY menunjukkan beberapa pengalaman traumatik pada masa kecil yang direpres. Konflik yang berkembang dengan ibu sehingga menghasilkan kompleks antara ego alien dengan ego. Kata kunci: skizofrenia simpleks, simtom negatif, diagnosis, ego ABSTRACT Simple Schizophrenia is an unusual type of schizophrenia characterized by slow, progressive development of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as inability to meet community demands, and overall performance degradation. Unlike other types of schizophrenia (hebephrenic, paranoid, and catatonic), simple schizophrenia is difficult to determine the diagnosis. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V cleared the diagnosis for simple schizophrenia, but in the Mental Disorder Diagnostic Classification Guidelines (MDDCG) III and International and Classification Diseases (ICD) -10 are included. This case study discusses patients diagnosed with simple schizophrenia with a comparative diagnosis of severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms. A man named AY, aged 28 years, and did not finish primary school has no father figure. He has worked fairly and liked the woman. The decline of psychological function then occurs. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia in AY are very prominent, ie, little speech, flat affects, withdrawal from social intercourse, lack of interest and ambition, and low vitality drive. AY has ideas or thoughts that he is guilty, sinful, and looks at something so dirty that there is repetitive washing behavior. The integration result of psychological tests shows pathological signs, such as depression, anxiety, and affective disorders. The psychological dynamics of AY shows some traumatic experiences in childhood that are repressed. Conflict that develops with the mother so as to produce a complex between alien ego with ego.

The disorder is common in neurological services and frequently seen by psychiatrists working in such settings. It is often associated with chronic severe disability. The diagnosis previously hinged on the neurologist’s demonstration of the lack of disease and the psychiatrist’s hypothesis of a ‘conversion’ of stress into a physical symptom. It is now based on positive findings on neurological assessment supplemented by a psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression disorders are common. Treatment is multi-disciplinary. Explanation of the condition to the patient is a crucial initial step supplemented, where necessary, by psychological treatment (especially for dissociative or non-epileptic attacks) and physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms. The prognosis without treatment is poor once the disability is established.",

Emotional arousal can be traced to the interaction between mechanisms involved in perception, memory, and other cognitive functions with the striatum, amygdala, and other limbic structures. Several factors are associated with portraying and conveying emotion, including social aspects, movement cues, vocal features, roughness or dissonance, and memory. Preference for specific musical pieces or styles is strongly influenced by emotional arousal experienced during adolescence, which is linked to a dopaminergic surge in the striatum during that time of life. Music can be used for emotional self-regulation via psychological mechanisms, such as reappraisal, which seem to involve top-down modulation from frontal cortex onto striatum and amygdala.",

      "title": "What attitude towards a patient with somatoform disorder?",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

The acute neurological manifestations of HIE have been well described [1,2] and are characterized by clinical evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction; impaired brainstem function, autonomic dysregulation, various abnormalities in mental state, epileptic seizures, and, in addition to tone and other motor abnormalities, non-epileptic movements i.e. myoclonus and tremors. The severity of the phenotype is dependent on the degree of cerebral insult, extent of subsequent injury incurred; with some correlation with outcome [1–4]. Because of the wide variety and often changing signs and symptoms post HI, coupled with the numerous co-morbid metabolic and systemic problems and the frequent occurrence of seizures which can be very difficult to differentiate clinically, this article will concentrate solely on describing the hyperkinetic non-epileptic movement disorder observed following transient HI in the term newborn.",

Aber auch klassische Präsentationen im Sinne von Depressionen oder Psychosen können durch immunologische Enzephalopathien verursacht werden. In Zusammenschau von Labor-, Bildgebungs- (MRT, ggf. FDG-PET), EEG- und Liquorbefunden kann die Diagnose einer immunologischen Enzephalopathie gestellt werden. Insbesondere dem Nachweis von Antikörpern gegen neuronale Zelloberflächenantigene oder intrazelluläre synaptische/onkoneuronale Antigene kommt eine wesentliche Bedeutung zu. Eine Tumorsuche und ggf. Behandlung ist in vielen Fällen angezeigt. Eine Tumorresektion kann in solchen Konstellationen eine genuin kausale Therapie der neuropsychiatrischen Symptomatik darstellen. Immunmodulatorisch kommen eine hoch dosierte Steroidbehandlung, Plasmapherese oder intravenöse Immunglobuline (First-Line) zum Einsatz. Bei fehlendem Ansprechen können Behandlungsversuche mit Rituximab oder Cyclophosphamid (Second-Line) erwogen werden. Das Erkennen von immunologischen Enzephalopathien im psychiatrisch-psychotherapeutischen Alltag ist wichtig, da potenziell lebensbedrohliche Erkrankungen vorliegen, oftmals eine Tumorassoziation besteht, eine im Vergleich zur klassischen psychiatrisch-medikamentösen Behandlung unkonventionelle bzw. innovative Behandlungsoption (Immuntherapie) vorliegt und diese Erkrankungen unter adäquater Behandlung potenziell reversibel sind.",

Zu beurteilen sind die körperlichen Voraussetzungen, nämlich die Gebrauchsfähigkeit von Armen und Beinen, das Sehvermögen und das Gleichgewicht sowie geistige (psychische) Voraussetzungen, nämlich die (visuelle) Wahrnehmungsfähigkeit, die Aufmerksamkeit und die Belastbarkeit. Zu deren Überprüfung werden in der Regel geeignete, objektivierbare psychologische Testverfahren verlangt. Festgestellte Eignungsmängel können unter Umständen durch entsprechende Hilfsmittel, Kfz-Umbauten oder durch eine besonders erfahrene, vorausschauende und sicherheitsbewusste Fahrweise kompensiert werden. Nicht kompensiert werden können homonyme Hemianopsie, persistierende Doppelbilder bei Geradeausblick, unvorhersehbar attackenförmig auftretender Schwindel, visuelles Hemineglektsyndrom sowie charakterliche Mängel. In der Beurteilung bei speziellen Krankheitsbildern ist immer vom Einzelfall auszugehen. Von einer Einschränkung der FE ist auszugehen, wenn eine Verkehrsgefährdung durch die Erkrankung/Symptomatik in konkreten Fahrsituationen anzunehmen ist, sodass ein Unfall mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit eintreten kann. Derartige Gefährdungssituationen entstehen durch Einschränkungen der körperlichen oder geistigen Leistungsfähigkeit, unvorhersehbar auftretende Störungen der Leistungsfähigkeit oder mangelnde Einsicht in Gefahren und Risiken. Die Bedingungen bei verschiedenen Krankheitsbildern/Syndromen werden diskutiert. Für das praktische Vorgehen werden neben der aktuellen klinischen Untersuchung ggf. ein EEG, Doppler-Sonographie der hirnversorgenden Gefäße und eine neuropsychologische Untersuchung empfohlen.",

      "title": "Ketamine In Acute and Chronic Pain Management",
      "abstract": "Acute and chronic pain remain important health problems both in the United States and worldwide. With the rise in the prevalence of many chronic degenerative diseases across the globe, the distribution and absolute numbers of persons experiencing acute and chronic pain have continued to increase. As a result, pain management has come to the forefront of the public health community.The manifestation of pain itself typically involves the peripheral and central nervous systems. Pain can classify as nociceptive, neuropathic or nocicplastic in origin. Nociceptive pain, also referred to as physiologic pain, results from activation of primary nociceptive afferents by actual or potential tissue-damaging stimuli. In nociceptive pain, large nerve integrity remains preserved as sensory receptors are stimulated within visceral and somatic structures. In contrast to nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain results for direct injury or disease affecting the somatosensory system and tends to be more disabling than nociceptive pain. Neuropathic pain subdivides into peripheral (e.g. diabetic neuropathy) and central (e.g., spinal cord injury or central poststroke pain), while nociceptive pain subcategorizes into somatic or visceral (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease). Recently, the International Association for the Study of Pain added a third category to pain classification of taxonomy for conditions that do not neatly fit into neuropathic or nocicplastic categories. Nociplastic pain refers to pain that arises from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage or evidence a disease or lesion directly affecting the somatosensory system. Conditions considered to be nocicplastic pain include fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I, and irritable bowel syndrome. One should keep in mind that there are several pain conditions, such as failed back surgery syndrome, that contain elements of more than one pain category, and can be classified as “mixed” pain states. In addition, conditions that are clearly classified as nociceptive and neuropathic often contain overlapping mechanisms with nocicplastic pain in that they involve abnormal nociceptive processing (e.g. amplified pain signals, expansion of receptive fields, decreased descending modulation). Pain can also categorize as acute, chronic, or a combination of these types (e.g. sickle cell crisis). Acute pain arises from a specific disease or injury and its duration is typically self-limited. Acute pain is considered to serve a protective biological purpose and is often associated with muscle spasm and sympathetic nervous system activation. In contrast, chronic pain may be considered a disease state, with its duration outlasting the normal time of healing when associated with disease or injury. Chronic pain may also stem from psychological states and does not serve an apparent biological purpose. Unlike the self-limited nature of acute pain, chronic pain often does not have a recognizable endpoint.",

      "abstract": "Social cognition has become a rapidly growing area of schizophrenia research. Individuals with schizophrenia show substantial and persistent impairments in a range of social cognitive domains, including emotion processing, social perception, attributional bias, and theory of mind. The social cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is associated with, but separable from, impairments in (nonsocial) neurocognition such as attention, memory, and problem solving. Social cognition is a key determinant of functional disability of schizophrenia; it acts as a mediator between neurocognition and functional outcome, and it contributes unique information about functional outcome beyond that provided by neurocognition. Efforts to develop interventions to improve social cognitive impairments through new pharmacological and training approaches are under way.",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Cerebral palsyaffects two to three children per 1,000 live-born children. Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life. Methods used, based on clinical kinesiology, and appropriate exercise and modification, kinesitherapy has positive effects in treating the condition of people with cerebral palsy.",

Thus a specific role for neurochemical or neuroendocrine factors certainly cannot be postulated or elucidated to explain such behavior in its entirety. Even when the term “antisocial” is used in other than a legal or criminological sense – for example, when it is applied in psychiatric diagnostics in an attempt to define and understand individual human behavior more fully – it remains overinclusive. From a clinical standpoint, the term “antisocial” most often signifies antisocial personality disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1952, 1968, 1980), which in the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) is considered an “axis II” personality disorder, which may or may not coexist with certain “axis I” clinical syndromes or other conditions. Simply stated, this means that, according to current diagnostic nomenclature, an antisocial personality disorder theoretically could coexist with an organic mental disorder, substance use disorder, paranoid disorder, depressive disorder, psychosexual disorder, and so on.",

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Neuropsychiatric ManifestationsThe manifestations of neuropsychiatric illness in lupus erythematosus in order of decreasing frequency are (1) alterations of mental function including organic brain syndromes, affective illnesses, and schizophrenia-like disorders;(2) transient or recurrent seizures, usually generalized, although a variety of forms has been described; (3) paresis resulting from ischemia or hemorrhage; (4) tremor, choreoathetosis, or ataxia; (5) nuclear and infranuclear cranial neuropathies; and (6) peripheral neuropathies, usually of a mixed sensory-motor variety.Feinglass et al. 1 surveyed the relationships of nervous system involvement to other manifestations of the disease.Neuropsychiatric manifestations attributed to central nervous system SLE occurred in 37% of 140 patients, and five of these presented with neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.The most frequent manifestations were psychiatric dysfunction, seizures, long tract signs, cranial neuropathy, and peripheral neuropathy.Psychiatric abnormalities secondary to SLE were characterized by organic features and by associated neurological findings, often diffuse or multifocal.The spinal fluid was abnormal in only 32%, usually a modest elevation of protein (70 to 92 mg/dl) and/or pleocytosis.The EEG was abnormal in 71%, particularly in association with seizures or focal neurological signs.Frequently, central nervous system abnormalities were an early feature, and in 63% neuropsychiatric involvement either",

Eine besondere Rolle spielt das Korsakoff-Syndrom, wobei überkommene Vorstellungen zum Wernicke-Korsakoff-Komplex wahrscheinlich revidiert werden müssen. Nur Alkoholmissbrauch erhöht das Demenzrisiko, während moderater Alkoholkonsum mit einem gegenüber Abstinenz verminderten Risiko einhergeht.

The consequence of this is the accumulation of traumatic or stressful developments in people. Stress or trauma is interpreted as an event beyond normal human experience. One form of illness that is associated with this is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD engages the affected person as a whole by acting on all aspects of person's development, that is, biological, psychological and social aspects. Biological plan includes the changes in the functioning of the nervous system, disruption of neurotransmitters such as cortisol, epinephrine, endorphins etc., which leads to changes in the mood and functions of our organism. In the psychological sphere, the victim manifests numerous symptoms, such as dissociation, learned helplessness, intrusive dreams and memories, emotional dullness, solitariness, depression, etc. In the social environment, especially in the family, large dysfunction occur. The victim unfavourably affects his or her environment, which at the same time represents, or at least it should represent, the supporting structure in overcoming the difficulties. The victims of PTSD live a difficult life in which each new day represents the beginning of a struggle with oneself. What is considered ordinary and normal, like self-control, sense of security or desire to discover new things, respresents a remarkable effort and hard work to the victims of PTSD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an efficient form of psychotherapy whose effectiveness is proven by numerous clinical studies in the treatments of various psychological disorders. Therefore, the importance of conduction of treatments in order to enable the ill persons to deal with the situation in the easiest possible way is incontestable. With family support, understanding environment, participating in therapies and pastoral models which are provided by the Church and which can be provided with spiritual-psychological assistance, the victim of the disorder can work on himself or herself and thus expect positive steps in dealing with the illness.",

It can be an isolated symptom or a symptom of another neurological disorder, such as dystonia, Parkinson disease, spinocerebellar ataxia et al. It is an unintentional, somewhat rhythmic, muscle movement involving to-and-fro movements of one or more parts of the body. It can affect the hands, arms, head, vocal cord, jaw, chin, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. Clinically, the most useful way to categorized tremor is whether it occurs mainly at rest, on postural, or during movement (kinetic tremor). Tremor is most common classified by different clinical features and cause or origin; include essential tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, cerebellar tremor, dystonic tremor, orthostatic tremor, physiologic tremor, and psychogenic tremor. Diagnosis need a detail history (include familial inheritance, drugs exposure, alcohol consumption or withdraw); complete physical examination and laboratory tests. Electromyography is also a simple and quick method with which to calculate tremor frequency and amplitude for assisting diagnosis. Treatment for majority of tremor syndrome is purely symptomatic, and is similar regardless of the underlying cause of the tremor. There are different medicines to try in order propranolol, clonazepam, primidome and gabapentin for limb tremors, or trihexyphenidyl for dystonic tremor. Focal botulinum toxin injection may be help in focal tremor. Neurosurgery is only indicated in severe tremor, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subthalamic nucleus for primary or secondary parkinsonian tremor.",

      "abstract": "Profound and debilitating fatigue is the most common complaint reported among individuals with autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. Fatigue is multi-faceted and broadly defined, which makes understanding the cause of its manifestations especially difficult in conditions with diverse pathology including autoimmune diseases. In general, fatigue is defined by debilitating periods of exhaustion that interfere with normal activities. The severity and duration of fatigue episodes vary, but fatigue can cause difficulty for even simple tasks like climbing stairs or crossing the room. The exact mechanisms of fatigue are not well understood, perhaps due to its broad definition. Nevertheless, physiological processes known to play a role in fatigue include oxygen/nutrient supply, metabolism, mood, motivation, and sleepiness—all which are affected by inflammation. Additionally, an important contributing element to fatigue is the central nervous system—a region impacted either directly or indirectly in numerous autoimmune and related disorders. This review describes how inflammation and the central nervous system contribute to fatigue and suggests potential mechanisms involved in fatigue that are likely exhibited in autoimmune and related diseases.",

      "title": "Limb weakness",
      "abstract": "The definition of weakness is important, because many patients who self-describe a ‘weak limb’ will actually have a clumsy limb (ataxia), a numb limb (reduced sensation), or a limb that is too painful to move. The time course of the onset of the symptoms in general reflects the time course of the underlying pathology: • Sudden onset (seconds to minutes) usually implies either trauma (e.g. displaced vertebral fractures due to major trauma) or certain vascular insults (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA)). • Subacute onset (hours to days) suggests a progressive demyelination (e.g. Guillain–Barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis) or a slowly expanding haematoma (e.g. subdural haematoma). • Chronic onset (weeks to months), is consistent with pathologies such as a slow-growing tumour or motor neuron disease (progressive degeneration of motor neurons). As only acute and subacute limb weakness will present acutely to generalists in hospital (chronic onset cases will most likely be referred to neurology from primary care), we have limited the chapter to these cases. Limb movement requires an intact pathway from the cerebral cortex, down the corona radiata, internal capsule, and pons, along the corticospinal tract of the spinal cord, out along a nerve root, and down a peripheral nerve to the neuromuscular junction and muscle itself. If a patient has limb weakness, there must be a lesion somewhere in this pathway. Figure 26.2 gives the differential diagnosis for limb weakness. Mr Walker has presented with rapid onset of left-sided arm weakness. Key clues in the history to elicit include: • Exact time of onset? This is critical in suspected strokes because the window of time in which to confirm the diagnosis and administer thrombolysis (if appropriate) is only 4.5 hours from onset of symptoms (after that, you risk doing more harm than good to the patient). If you suspect a stroke in a patient within that time frame, call the thrombolysis team immediately. In this case, all we can say is that the onset was at some point in the 7 hours between 11 p.m. (when he went to sleep) and 6 a.m. (when he woke up), so we cannot confidently say the onset was within 4.5 hours.",

      "title": "Memory impairment in post-traumatic stress disorder: Behavioral and neuroimaging findings",
      "abstract": "When an event is perceived as life-threatening or as having the potential to cause serious bodily injury to oneself or others, an intense feeling of fear, horror or helplessness can arise and the memory process can be disrupted, leading to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This pathology is characterized by three kinds of symptoms: (i) re-experiencing, which is probably the main PTSD symptom and refers to intrusive memories occurring in flashbacks and/or nightmares so invasive that PTSD sufferers feels as if they are reliving the sensory and emotional aspects as occurring in the present; (ii) avoidance, where sufferers try to avoid everything that may remind them of the traumatic event (thoughts, places, people, and other reminders of the trauma) and (iii) hyper-arousal, which includes hyper-vigilance, exaggerated startled reactions, sleep disturbances, and irritability. The purpose of this article is to review the current state of knowledge on memory disturbances and cerebral abnormalities that are central to the pathology’s importance. PTSD in adults is well documented, and a concise description of the impairment of traumatic event memory has been established, involving both enhanced memory for emotional aspects and decreased memory for contextual information. As for traumatic events, memory for everyday events is also impaired in PTSD, with hypermnesia for negative information and lower memorizing of neutral information. Structural and functional abnormalities of brain areas involved in episodic memory (hippocampus), emotional memory (amygdala), and emotional regulation (medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices) seem involved in memory disturbances observed in PTSD. We will describe the two main theories synthesizing current understanding of adult PTSD. In children, while the symptoms are well described, the lack of investigations hinders the accurate identification of a particular profile of memory dysfunctions and their cerebral substrates. However, we will review the few findings in this field.",

      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common psychiatric complication associated with pregnancy and childbirth with debilitating symptoms that negatively impact the quality of life of the mother as well as inflict potentially long-lasting developmental impairments to the child. Much of the theoretical pathophysiology put forth to explain the emergence of PPD overlaps with that of major depressive disorder (MDD) and, although not conventionally described in such terms, can be seen as neurodegenerative in nature. Framing the disorder from the perspective of the well-established inflammatory theory of depression, symptoms are thought to be driven by dysregulation, and subsequent hyperactivation of the body's immune response to stress. Compounded by physiological stressors such as drastic fluctuations in hormone signaling, physical and psychosocial stressors placed upon new mothers lay bare a number of significant vulnerabilities, or points of potential failure, in systems critical for maintaining healthy brain function. The inability to compensate or properly adapt to meet the changing demands placed upon these systems has the potential to damage neurons, hinder neuronal growth and repair, and disrupt neuronal circuit integrity such that essential functional outputs like mood and cognition are altered. The impact of this deterioration in brain function, which includes depressive symptoms, extends to the child who relies on the mother for critical life-sustaining care as well as important cognitive stimulation, accentuating the need for further research.",

      "abstract": "The mentalising abilities of schizophrenic patients and normal controls were tested using picture sequencing and story-telling tasks that required subjects to infer causal mental states in story characters, and a recall task that required subjects to dissociate subjective mental states from objective realities. Selective mentalising deficits were found in some patients. For other patients, general sequencing errors, \"sensory\" mentalising, and poor recall of symbolic representations suggested more profound problems. Task results were best accounted for by dissociable cognitive abnormalities, rather than graded dysfunction of a central mentalising mechanism. Symptom profiles of patient subgroups and correlations between task measures and clinical ratings linked these cognitive abnormalities to specific symptoms. General sequencing difficulty was associated with both poverty symptoms and reality distortion, suggesting that two mechanisms may underpin such errors: one, inability to manipulate symbolic representations, being linked to poverty; the other, failure to critically evaluate plausible cause-and-effect, being linked to reality distortion. There was some evidence that defective self-monitoring underpins thought disorder. Impaired metarepresentation was linked to the autisticlike symptoms of flat affect, social dysfunction, and alogia, rather than reality distortion. Implications of these findings are discussed with respect to theoretical and methodological issues confronting current schizophrenia research.",

The clinical features of delirium predominantly involve subacute changes in cognition, awareness, and activity levels, behavioral disturbance, clouding consciousness, and sleep-wake cycle changes. In contrast, epilepsy involves the acute interruption of brain function, often with convulsive activity, falls, and injury. States that may share the clinical features of both, such as nonconvulsive epileptic states, are also important: the cause of brain derangement is one of excessive and abnormal electrical brain activity. In such conditions, the clinical manifestations may resemble states of delirium and confusion, and the absence of convulsive clinical activity is significant. Electroencephalography remains the diagnostic test of choice: it is essential for differentiating these two conditions, enabling the distinctly different treatments and epilepsy. Ongoing research and investigation are essential to better understand the abnormal brat mechanisms underlying delirium, and to develop better tools for objective diagnosis.",

The prevalence of depression does not decrease in the elderly, affective disorders in old people, however, often manifest masked by physical illness worsening the course of these somatic disorders. Elderly depression also tends to present with a peculiar clinical picture. Atypical and also only few symptoms are characteristic of depression in the elderly. Vegetative symptoms are often primary and depression in old people often manifests solely in somatic symptoms. Typical cognitive alterations and pseudodementia are also characteristic features. At the same time, typical affective symptoms of depression are often absent, and instead of psychomotor retardation, psychomotor agitation manifested as irritability or motor restlessness is frequent. In the diagnostic process depression in the elderly should be separated from somatic diseases and dementia. The correct diagnosis and treatment of depression in the elderly is very important, since old age depression does not only cause significant distress, but often leads to suicide, and in addition, it generally increases morbidity and mortality, worsens the general somatic condition of the patient and increases social isolation.",

En nuestro estudio hemos estudiado una poblacion de nacidos pretermino a la edad de 5 anos y, tras una exploracion oftalmologica completa, hemos realizado el cuestionario a los cuidadores de los pacientes a fin de identificar una posible disfuncion visual cerebral y, a la vez, poder aconsejar ciertas medidas rehabilitadores a fin de mejorar la calidad de vida de estos pacientes.",

In this paper we propose to review the physiopathology, clinical features and diagnostic procedures of these crises.There are three types of reflex anoxic cerebral crises: asphyxiating anoxic crises, ischemic anoxic crises and asphyxiating-ischemic anoxic crises. They are caused by sudden activation of the so-called syncopal reflex. They are characterized by diverse clinical manifestations and may often be mistaken for epileptic crises. They are related to various precipitating factors such as a blow, often to the head, an emotional stimulus or something which upsets or molests, hyperthermia, abdominal pain, headache, physical exertion, prolonged standing-up, exposure to heat, the sight of blood, feeling of fear and other factors.Important elements for the diagnosis of these crises are the presence of a family history of vagal crises, the presence of precipitating factors, brief duration of the crises (seconds) in most patients, and clinical signs of facial or perioral pallor or cyanosis. The test involving pressure on the eyeball and the tilting table are useful for diagnosis. However, they should be used sensibly.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

      "title": "Pain and Cognition: A Narrative Review of the Effects of Chronic Pain on Neuropsychological Functioning",
      "abstract": "It is widely established that chronic pain has a negative effect on neurocognitive functioning, in both adult and pediatric populations. These impairments are specifically strong in the areas of memory, processing speed, attention, and executive functions, and particularly among older patients and those with fibromyalgia. However, the exact mechanism explaining the relationship between cognition and pain has yet to be determined. Two main hypotheses are posited: 1) pain is distracting and removes focus from the task at hand, resulting in decreased cognitive performance, and 2) the neural systems involved in both pain and cognition are closely linked and may even modulate one another reciprocally.The relationship is complex in nature and it is important to consider factors that could be potential mediators or moderators of the relationship, such as age, sex, cognitive load, fatigue, opioid use, pain intensity, pain location, sleep disturbance, fatigue, tendencies toward somatization and/or somatic vigilance, and emotional state. These factors have all been shown to interact with cognition on some level, whether they are independently associated with cognitive dysfunction or, in tandem with pain, disrupt cognitive processes.",

One of the most important consequences in the ischemic ictus is the cerebral damage, which is a consequence of a complex mixture of biochemical processes. Among them the excitoxicity mediated by glutamate. Not only has excitoxicity a central role in the IBD, but also in situations of acute trauma and in diverse neurodegenerative diseases. The focal model of obstruction of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in rats by means of intraluminal suture that causes a cortical frontoparietal lesion as well as in the dorsolateral striatum allows evaluating the phenomena of cellular stress in the ischemic focus or in oligaemia areas or ischemic penumbra. The cerebral ischemia unchains a sequence of molecular phenomena that begin with the lack of energy secondary to the interruption of the processes of oxidative phosphorylation and the deficit of adenosin triphosphate (ATP) production. These processes could be responsible for several degenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, ischemic stroke, epilepsy and schizophrenia. The study of these processes could increase the understanding of the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia, allowing progress in design of neuroprotective strategies, achieving to decrease the mortality and morbidity of patients with IBD.",

Insidensi kejadian skizofrenia cukup besar, biasanya terjadi pada kelompok sosial ekonomi rendah dengan derajat keparahan lebih besar terjadi pada negara maju. Terdapat beberapa faktor penyebab skizofrenia yaitu faktor genetik, keseimbangan kimia pada otak, stress diathesis dan faktor psikososial. Tingkat kekambuhan pada penderita skizofrenia setelah perawatan di Rumah sakit cukup tinggi, hal tersebut dapat terjadi karena kurangnya pengetahuan keluarga mengenai penyakit skizofrenia serta keluarga yang memiliki ekspresi emosi yang tinggi, hal itu berkorelasi negatif tehadap kekambuhan penderita skizofrenia. Terapi musik merupakan salah satu bentuk dari teknik relaksasi. Efek terapi musik pada sistem limbik dan saraf otonom adalah menciptakan suasana rileks, aman dan menyenangkan sehingga merangsang pelepasan zat kimia Gamma Amino Butyic Acid (GABA), enkefallin, atau beta endorphin yang dapat mengeliminasi neurotransmiter rasa tertekan, cemas dan stres sehingga menciptakan ketenangan dan memperbaiki suasana hati atau mood pasien. Musik yang lembut, lambat dan tanpa lirik secara signifikan dapat menurunkan sistolik tekanan darah, detak jantung, laju pernapasan dan saturasi oksigen, apabila seseorang melamun atau merasa dirinya berada dalam suasana hati yang emosional atau tidak terfokus, musik klasik dapat membantu memperkuat kesadaran dan meningkatkan organisasi mental seseorang.

Diagnosis of major depression in old age could also could be a challenge, due to aspects like (1) there is a higher vulnerability to the stigma of depression in this population, (2) hypochondriac ideation and somatic symptoms are the main symptoms, while depressive disposition or anhedonia are under-reported by such patients, (3) differential diagnosis includes various organic diseases, but also several psychiatric disorders, like neurocognitive disorders, organic affective disorders, drug induced affective disorders etc. Reduction of social relationships caused by retirement and loss of spouse and friends, as well as a decrease of personal income could precipitate or maintain depressive disorders during late-life. Quality of life in patients diagnosed with depressive major disorders is a rarely monitored parameter, although its importance for case management could not be overemphasized. A reduction of life quality correlates with a poorer functional prognosis, persistence of neglected residual symptoms, low adherence to treatment plan.",

      "abstract": "The management of a patient with epilepsy requires the physician to address himself to two basic tasks: (1) an accurate diagnosis must be made with special attention to the possibility of progressive intracranial disease; and (2) an effective regimen for control of the seizures must be devised. DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGE Seizures beginning in infancy are accompanied, in about half of cases, by other evidence of cerebral damage, especially mental subnormality. The precise pathology often cannot be determined during life, although a cerebral developmental defect or birth injury is usually responsible. In a small proportion of cases a metabolic error, subdural hematoma, neuronal degenerative disease, or some other progressive process will be revealed by a history of deterioration in skills previously acquired. The diagnosis can then be established by other characteristic signs of the condition under consideration and appropriate laboratory studies. Grand mal, focal seizures and minor motor seizures are the types usually encountered in infancy. The same factors which commonly cause seizures in infancy continue to initiate seizures in childhood and early adolescence, but to a steadily decreasing extent. Thus, seizures due to a birth injury, like most post-traumatic seizures, usually begin within 24 months after the traumatic incident1; however, they may be delayed until late childhood or adolescence. Seizures appearing as a sequela of meningitis or other infections are sometimes similarly delayed. After the second year of life, seizures of unknown cause rapidly increase in incidence, including cases of so-called genetic epilepsy. In the latter, centrencephalic seizure bursts (3/sec wave and spike discharges) appear diffusely in the EEG, not only in patients, but in 45% of their asymptomatic siblings (aged 4 to 16 years), as well.",

Here, we report a 60‐year‐old male patient who presented with a sudden onset of disorientation and short‐term memory loss and started to ask about his whereabouts and what happened. He had no significant past medical or psychiatric disorder. Likewise, the patient did not have a recent history of head trauma, substance abuse, loss of consciousness, seizure disorder, or migraine. Neurologic examination was normal except for mild disorientation and short‐term memory impairment. He had a score of 18/30 on the mini‐mental state examination. Extensive laboratory investigations did not show any abnormal findings. Brain MRI and EEG were normal. His memory improved and returned to a normal baseline within 24 h from the onset. After the exclusion of potential causes and the patient returned to a normal state of memory, the diagnosis of transient global amnesia was made. At the follow‐up visit, the patient was in a state of normal function without a recurrence of memory impairment. Here, we presented this interesting case of transient global amnesia. TGA is a diagnosis of exclusion and is essential to keep in mind when evaluating a patient with acute onset of short‐term memory impairment, especially when etiological investigations reveal no potential cause.",

The persistent monoideistic preoccupation tends to acquire the quality of a repetitive hypnotic suggestion or \"inner commands\" and creates an altered state of consciousness that transcends the limits of volitional control. The one-sided ideational context permeates interpersonal relations, intensifies family conflict and drains a considerable portion of available psychic energy. Disregard or an incorrect approach to this factor may result in painful therapeutic failure, since no exploratory psychotherapy or verbal intervention technique will be able to penetrate the monoideistic armour. THe continuous repetition of the dominant idea functions as a cumulative suggestion stimulus leading to disruption of spontaneous processes and self-defeating thinking, behavioral, motivational, and affective changes. The monoideistic preoccupation may be total and pervade the individual's entire life. Any comprehensive form of therapy should offer formulations and precise procedures--for the identified patient, nuclear family, and network of significant others--to block the feedback supplying system attached to the monoideistic pattern.",

DSM-III changed the term “organic” to “secondary to a medical illness.” In DSM-5, mania and depression secondary or due to a medical illness were moved to “other mental disorders.” These days the terms “organic,” “secondary,” and “neuropsychiatric” are used interchangeably. Psychotropic agents mainly have symptomatic effects when used for mood or anxiety or cognitive symptoms in the context of medical illnesses. In chronic traumatic encephalopathy, low-dose lithium may assist with mood and impulsivity and suicidality, as well as potential dementia progression.

      "abstract": "Diverse neuromuscular disorders can complicate the course of a severely ill patient. Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is the most precisely defined neuromuscular complication in this context. It is characterized by a primary axonal degeneration of the motor and sensory nerve fibers with degeneration of the skeletal muscles as a result of their denervation. The precise etiology of CIP remains elusive. Electrophysiology must be used to confirm the diagnosis of CIP because clinical evaluation is clearly insufficient and testing can also exclude other entities such as a Guillain-Barré syndrome or a primary disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Nerve biopsy studies are not required for a diagnosis of CIP. Other disorders can explain neurophysiological abnormalities in critically ill patients after the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, such as persistent neuromuscular junction blockade, pure axonal neuropathy, and necrotizing myopathy. The incidence of myopathies in critically ill patients is not well characterized, although the incidence most likely is high in critically ill patients with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). The clinical picture of a primary myopathy is indistinguishable from other ICU-acquired causes of neuromuscular disease. Three main forms of myopathies in the ICU have been described: critical illness myopathy, thick filament myopathy, and necrotizing myopathy. Myopathies are difficult to detect because the neurophysiological studies are neither sensitive nor specific and a muscle biopsy is required.",

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

It is unclear whether the frequency of these disorders increases or decreases with age. Clinical expression of psychiatric disorders in old age may be different from that seen in younger age groups, with less and often milder symptoms. Concurrently, comorbidity between different psychiatric disorders is immense, as well as comorbidity with somatic disorders. Cognitive function is often decreased in people with depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis, but whether these disorders are risk factors for dementia is unclear. Psychiatric disorders in the elderly are often related to cerebral neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease, although psychosocial risk factors are also important. Psychiatric disorders, common among the elderly, have consequences that include social deprivation, poor quality of life, cognitive decline, disability, increased risk for somatic disorders, suicide, and increased nonsuicidal mortality.",

Ces troubles s’observent majoritairement dans les epilepsies partielles, particulierement les epilepsies temporales, mais peuvent concerner aussi les sujets presentant une epilepsie generalisee idiopathique. Les perturbations a l’origine de ces troubles sexuels sont multiples, psychologiques mais aussi physiologiques. L’etiologie de ces troubles, quasi certainement multifactorielle, reste imparfaitement elucidee. Les decharges et crises epileptiques, les lesions cerebrales, des troubles ou handicaps psychiques, intellectuels et sociaux, des modifications hormonales et neuro-endocriniennes, des effets collateraux des medicaments antiepileptiques, le traitement neuro-chirurgical de l’epilepsie sont autant de facteurs contributifs ou etiologiques dont certains sont fortement co-dependants. Les troubles sexuels en relation avec les crises sont beaucoup plus rares, qu’il s’agisse de crises comportant une semiologie de type sexuel ou d’exceptionnelles crises survenant en relation temporelle avec une activite sexuelle.

These disorders can appear without a context of histrionic personality. The evolution of hysterical disorders during life is not well known. First of all, because the nosographic systems are not constant and, secondly, because the disorders themselves can vary when observed at different times. The aging subject is exposed to an increasing symptomatology or conversely, to an improvement due to the waekening of the narcissism. It is also possible that a continuum could be established from hysterical symptoms in the adulthood to delusions or hallucinations in the elderly. The relation with the old hysteric subject must be marked by empathy and by the conviction that improvement will only lead back to a basal symptomatology.",

These may be obvious, such as hallucinations or paranoid delusions, or they may be subtle, appearing as changes in personality or motivation. 2 The three most common categories of neuropsychiatric posttransplant complications include the following: (1) concurrent pathological processes, such as mass lesion; (2) effects of vasoconstriction secondary to immunosuppressive medications; and (3) central nervous system pharmacodynamic effects of the immunosuppressive medications. 3 This differential diagnosis should guide the history as well as the mental status and neurological examinations. Suspected acute processes deserve computed tomography scanning. Magnetic resonance imaging, more sensitive to subtle structural change, should be generally reserved for cases suggesting such chronic change or those in which treatment appears ineffective. 4 Treatment follows the differential diagnosis. Concurrent diagnoses dictate specific treatment, such as in drainage of a subdural hematoma or administration of antibiotics for cerebral abscess. Symptoms referable to vasoconstriction suggest switching the primary immunosuppressive agent. Symptoms suggesting delirium indicate lowering the dosage of immunosuppressive medication, as in the case of generalized seizure, or use of very low-dose antipsychotic medication, as in cases of confusion, amotivational states, or personality changes.",

      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

Around 10% of patients with mild cognitive impairment progress to dementia each year. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of cases. Other common types of dementia are vascular, fronto-temporal, Lewy body, Parkinson's, and mixed type dementia. There is evidence to suggest that dementia pathology is established before the onset of symptoms, and thus mild cognitive impairment can be considered as a predementia stage. NICE guidance suggests examination of: attention, concentration, short- and long-term memory, praxis, language and executive function. Particular attention should be paid to any signs of neglect, state of dress, agitation or poor attention. Dysphasia and difficulty in naming objects is often present. Mood symptoms (including suicidal ideation) may be primary or comorbid. Abnormal thoughts and perceptions should be probed for, as psychotic symptoms are common. Primary care options for cognitive testing include the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition or the Abbreviated Mental Test Score. Physical examination should include observation of gait, inspection for tremor; examination for rigidity, bradykinesia, frontal release signs, upper motor neurone lesions, pulse and BP. Structural brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy, exclude other pathologies and act as a prognostic marker of dementia progression but the overlap in structural changes between the dementias makes imaging alone insufficient for diagnostic purposes. NICE guidelines recommend referral to a memory clinic for patients with mild cognitive impairment, those at high risk of dementia, such as patients with learning disabilities, Parkinson's disease, or patients who have had several strokes.",

      "abstract": "Memory is the ability of an organism to store, retain, and subsequently recall information. Memory enhancers are the compounds which improve or enhance the memory. The compounds, enhance memory are called nootropics. Some physiological conditions such as stress, anxiety affect the memory. Memory loss may be age related and due to some disease condition like Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease etc. There are several nootropics marketed such as torental, duxil but these products has side effects like vascular dementia related to lacunae or to multiple infarcts, or leucoaraiosis and drg related amnesia. So mostly people prefer herbal nootropics over synthetic nootropics because they have less side effects than others. Herbal nootrppics mainly act by different ways like by increasing and replenishing neurotransmitter at high concentration in brain, by anti-depression, adaptogenic and mood stabilization, by improved oxygen supply and brain energy, by improved concentration, stamina, and focus, by memory enhancement and learning improvement, by nerve growth stimulation and brain cell protection. Memory is the most imperative characteristic for effectual survival of human beings. It also differentiates humans from animals. Reminiscence is the ability of an personage to record the in sequence and recall it whenever needed. Traditionally herbal drugs have been used to augment cognitive functions. A figure of medicinal plants and medicines derived from these plants have shown memory enhancing properties by virtue of their medicinal constituents. There has been substantial pharmacological exploration into the memory enhancing activity of some compounds. Since allopathic system of medicine is yet to make available a radical cure, the usefulness of traditional medicines needs to be explored. This article reviews the memory enhancing properties of the most commonly employed herbal medicines and their identified active constituents. The herbs acting on the brain are called Nootropic herbs and their isolated constituents are referred to as smart drugs. These herbs enhance the memory as well as increase blood circulation in the brain.",

      "abstract": "Dementia is a collective term used to describe the problems that people with various underlying brain disorders or damage can have with their memory, language and thinking.\n Alzheimer's disease, vascular disease, front temporal dementia are the best known and most common disorders under the umbrella of dementia. Dementia as a clinical syndrome is characterized by global cognitive impairment, which represents a decline from previous level of functioning, and is associated with impairment in functional abilities and, in many cases, behavioral and psychiatric disturbances. It is a chronic progressive debilitating disease that is largely a disorder of old age. It is characterized by widespread impairment of mental functioning, progressive memory loss, language difficulties, confusion and disorientation. These impairments are often accompanied by behavioral and psychological disturbance. The behavioural disturbances associated with dementia are defined as symptoms of disturbed perception, altered thought content, mood and behavior. Dementia is not merely a problem of memory. It reduces the ability to learn reason, retain or recall past experience and there is also loss of patterns of thoughts, feelings and activities. Additional mental and behavioral problems often affect people who have dementia, and may influence quality of life and the need for institutionalization. As dementia worsens individuals may neglect themselves and may become disinhibited, the individual may become incontinent as their condition worsens. Depression affects 20–30% of people who have dementia, and about 20% have anxiety. Psychosis and agitation/aggression also often accompany dementia. The evidence base on the prevalence of dementia is expanding rapidly, particularly in countries with low and middle incomes. There is such a wide range of dementia and levels of severity that the associated complications are vast. Complications may include increased infections anywhere in the body, loss of ability to function or care for self, loss of ability to interact, abuse by an overstressed caregiver, reduced lifespan, and side effects of medications used to treat the disorder.We select this problem as our research study because we want to assess effectiveness of structural teaching programme (STP) on knowledge regarding dementia among adults in a selected community area at Delhi/ NCR”. The study aims to assess the knowledge regarding knowledge regarding dementia among adults in a selected community area at Delhi/ NCR”. This study is a type of experimental research. The research approach used in this study was experimental survey approach. A purposive sampling technique was used to select the samples. The size of the sample was 30 individuals. Data were collected by using closed questionnaire schedule. Analysis was done by descriptive and inferential Statistics. The result showed that the mean post-test knowledge score (20) was higher than the mean pre-test score (20). The mean difference pre-test score (6.8) of knowledge was significant at 0.05% level at the “t”=7.42*P<0.05. Hence research hypothesis H1 was accepted. This indicates that the planed reaching program was effective in increasing the knowledge about dementia and prevention of dementia among adults.",

Si bien sabemos que la causa de la enfermedad es una afectacion cerebral, se desconoce, no solo la etiologia de dicha afectacion, sino el momento en que esta sucede, su posterior evolucion y los factores pronosticos. Una de las manifestaciones de esta afectacion cerebral, es el deterioro cognitivo. El deterioro cognitivo propio de la esquizofrenia se ha demostrado que no es difuso o generalizado, sino que afecta de forma diferencial y especifica a la atencion, memoria de trabajo, memoria y funciones ejecutivas, si bien es cierto que otras funciones que dependen del optimo funcionamiento de estas, van a verse secundariamente afectadas. Asi mismo, la literatura avala la asociacion de la gravedad de la afectacion cognitiva a la mayor presencia de sintomas negativos y a un peor desempeno social y laboral. El deficit cognitivo inherente a la enfermedad se ha podido observar tambien en familiares sanos de personas con esquizofrenia y en poblaciones de riesgo para desarrollar psicosis, por lo que determinados deficits cognitivos han sido conceptualizados como marcadores endofenotipicos de vulnerabilidad a la esquizofrenia. Una de las cuestiones aun sin resolver en relacion con el deterioro cognitivo en la esquizofrenia, es su evolucion a lo largo del desarrollo de la enfermedad, habiendose planteado como hipotesis alternativas, que su evolucion es estatica, o que sigue un curso de deterioro, lento, pero progresivo. Para tratar de responder a esta cuestion, se ha realizado un estudio de diseno transversal, con una muestra de 22 pacientes con una evolucion de la enfermedad entre uno y cinco anos, y 21 pacientes con diez o mas anos de evolucion de la enfermedad.",

      "abstract": "Characteristic symptoms of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) are (muscle) weakness, muscle pain, cognitive deficits, neurological abnormalities, but above all post-exertional malaise: a long-lasting increase of symptoms after a minor exertion. In contrast, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is primarily defined by 鈥渃hronic fatigue鈥? Since 鈥渃hronic fatigue鈥?is not mandatory for the diagnosis ME, and post-exertional malaise and cognitive deficits are not obligatory for the diagnosis CFS, the case criteria for ME and CFS define two distinct, partly overlapping nosological entities. ME and CFS are considered to be enigmatic diseases, qualified by some authors as 鈥渕edically unexplained syndromes鈥?of 鈥渇unctional syndromes鈥? However, specific abnormalities consistently observed over the years and their direct and indirect sequels can plausibly explain characteristic symptoms, e.g. 鈥渆xhaustion鈥?and pain. Abnormalities established repetitively incorporate immunological aberrations (inflammation, immune activation, immunosuppression, and immune dysfunction), persistent and/or reactivating infections, gastro-intestinal dysbiosis, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, a (prolonged) deviant response to exertion and orthostatic stress, circulatory deficits, and neurological abnormalities.This article depicts the 4I hypothesis, an explanatory model for ME (CFS) with a central role for four types of immunological abnormalities: inflammation, (Th2-predominated) immune activation, immunosuppression, and immune dysfunction. The potential direct sequels of these abnormalities, e.g. increased oxidative and nitrosative stress, (reactivating or chronic) infections, and their possible indirect consequences, e.g. mitochondrial dysfunction, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) axis hypofunction, and cardiovascular dysregulation, can plausibly explain various distinctive symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g. 鈥渆xhaustion鈥?

      "title": "Autonomic Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) results not only in motor and sensory deficits but also in autonomic dysfunctions. The disruption of connections between higher brain centers and the spinal cord, or the impaired autonomic nervous system itself, manifests a broad range of autonomic abnormalities. This includes compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, thermoregulatory, and sexual activities. These disabilities evoke potentially life‐threatening symptoms that severely interfere with the daily living of those with SCI. In particular, high thoracic or cervical SCI often causes disordered hemodynamics due to deregulated sympathetic outflow. Episodic hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia develops as a result of massive sympathetic discharge often triggered by unpleasant visceral or sensory stimuli below the injury level. In the pelvic floor, bladder and urethral dysfunctions are classified according to upper motor neuron versus lower motor neuron injuries; this is dependent on the level of lesion. Most impairments of the lower urinary tract manifest in two interrelated complications: bladder storage and emptying. Inadequate or excessive detrusor and sphincter functions as well as detrusor‐sphincter dyssynergia are examples of micturition abnormalities stemming from SCI. Gastrointestinal motility disorders in spinal cord injured‐individuals are comprised of gastric dilation, delayed gastric emptying, and diminished propulsive transit along the entire gastrointestinal tract. As a critical consequence of SCI, neurogenic bowel dysfunction exhibits constipation and/or incontinence. Thus, it is essential to recognize neural mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying various complications of autonomic dysfunctions after SCI. This overview provides both vital information for better understanding these disorders and guides to pursue novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate secondary complications. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

This descriptive study aimed to document cognitive deficits in a sample of the 2003 infected population reported in New Mexico. Patients with clinically defined neuroinvasive disease or who were impaired on brief mental status screening were seen for comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. We found that one year after symptom onset, more than half of the sample had objectively measurable neuropsychological impairment in at least two cognitive domains. Impairment was not related to subjective complaints of physical or emotional distress, or premorbid intellectual abilities. Persistent cognitive impairment in West Nile virus infection may be due to prolonged or permanent damage to the central nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Specific learning disorders (SLD) involve persistent difficulties in reading, writing, and/or mathematics, with a neurobiological basis and not attributable to intellectual, sensory deficits, or inadequate instruction. Their prevalence in school populations ranges from 5–15%, with significant impact on academic performance, self-esteem, and social participation. Objective: To synthesize evidence on the neurobiological foundations, differential diagnosis, and educational implications of SLD, guiding clinical and pedagogical practice. Development: Dyslexia shows alterations in left temporo-parietal phonological networks and, in some cases, in the dorsal magnocellular-visual pathway, suggesting a multisystem disorder. Dyscalculia is associated with intraparietal sulcus dysfunction and altered numeric-mnemonic connectivity. Dysgraphia may be linguistic (phonological-orthographic deficit) or motor (dyspraxia/DCD), linked to working memory and executive function impairments. Comorbidities (e.g., ADHD) further complicate cognitive profiles and interventions. Strategies such as the Response to Intervention model support early detection, while Universal Design for Learning and assistive technologies promote educational inclusion. Continuous teacher training and socio-emotional learning programs are essential to mitigate negative effects and foster resilience. Conclusions: SLD require comprehensive diagnosis, evidence-based interventions, and inclusive adaptations. Combining early screening, targeted support, accessible environments, and teacher training enhances academic and psychosocial outcomes. Further research is needed to optimize identification and intervention protocols, particularly regarding dyscalculia and emerging technologies.",

      "abstract": "Ring (20) chromosome epilepsy syndrome is characterized by highly refractory epilepsy that is often associated with non-pathognomonic, electroencephalographic (EEG) changes. Seizures typically begin during the stage of childhood around the age of 6 years. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is the most common seizure types and is distinguished by a long-lasting, confusional state that is often associated with EEG patterns in the form of prolonged, high-voltage slow waves with occasional spike/sharp components. Patients with this syndrome suffer from intractable seizures with cognitive decline and frequent epileptic episodes. Accompanying features of this rare disorder, such as superficial minor dysmorphic abnormalities if any, mental retardation and behavioral changes are quite variable. Because of the variability in clinical presentation, in particular the lack of clear dysmorphic features, the clinical diagnosis of this disorder can be delayed before being diagnosed genetically. Most patients with this syndrome have chromosomal changes in the form of a mosaic. High levels of mosaicism correlate well with a lower age of onset and severe cognitive impairment. Here, we emphasize the importance of early G-banding chromosomal analysis when patients present with unexplainable severe seizures and repetitive NCSE, even in the absence of any dysmorphic features suggestive of a chromosomal disorder.",

      "abstract": "Poremecaj nevoljne emocionalne ekspresije (PNEE), engl. involuntary emotional expression disorder (IEED) je sindrom disinhibicije emocionalne ekspresije karakteriziran nevoljnim, relativno stereotipnim epizodama plakanja i/ili smijanja bez vidljivog podražaja koji bi pokrenuo takav odgovor. U znanstvenoj literaturi poznat je kao pseudobulbarni afekt, emocionalna labilnost, afektivna labilnost, emocionalna inkontinencija i patoloski plac ili smijeh. Javlja se kod razlicitih neuroloskih i psihijatrijskih bolesti i stanja kao sto su moždani udar, demencija, amiotroficna lateralna skleroza, Parkinsonova bolest, multipla skleroza, traumatska moždana ostecenja. Neuropatofiziologija sindroma nije razjasnjena. Pretpostavlja se da neurostrukturalno ostecenje narusava koordinaciju između doživljenih osjecaja i motorne ekspresije. Ovaj sindrom je rijetko prepoznat u klinickoj praksi i cesto se pogresno dijagnosticira i lijeci kao depresija, bipolarni afektivni poremecaj, generalizirani anksiozni poremecaj, poremecaj licnosti ili parcijalna epilepsija. Lijecenje je za sada simptomatsko, koriste se triciklicki antidepresivi, selektivni inhibitori ponovne pohrane serotonina (SIPPS), NMDA-agonisti. Nedavna istraživanja pokazuju da bi lijekovi koji smanjuju ekscesivnu glutamatergicnu aktivnost kao npr. dekstrometorfan hidrobromid mogli biti ucinkoviti u lijecenju PNEE-a. Prikazat cemo bolesnicu u pocetnoj fazi demencije tipa Alzheimer u koje je doslo do razvoja PNEE-a.",

      "abstract": "Depression (e.g. depressive episode) is a pathological affective disorder characterized by several emotional, physical, behavioural and cognitive symptoms, which vary in duration, and are characterized by progressive evolution. Over time, they lead to an important alteration of daily activities (domestic, social, professional) of the person. At present, with life expectancy continuing increasing all over the world and with 10% of the total world population being over 65, the incidence of neuro-degenerative and affective disorders becomes an important concern for specialists. Old age is accompanied by important changes in the person’s self perception and perception of the environment; although depression in the elderly is not different from depression in young age, clinical data have evidentiated a particular type of depressive disorder related to old age, characterized by: motivational deficiency, low concentration and attention capacity, psychomotor impairment, which are frequently accompanied by several organic degenerative diseases. Many times, depression of the elderly is underdiagnosed and remains insufficiently treated. Drug therapy should be associated with psychotherapy, in order to improve patient compliance and motivation. The antidepressants existing nowadays in therapy are more selective and with fewer side effects than the first generation antidepressants: serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, sertralin), serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (as venlafaxine) are preferred, taking into account the multiple health conditions that may coexist in the elderly patient.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Noise‐induced hearing loss due to intense and long‐term noise exposure is no longer disputed since the etiology is well defined. However, the influence of noise on the vegetative functions is not so clear. In addition to existing investigations on vegetative functional disturbances, the role of noise as a risk factor has to be determined and its effects have to be quantified. The significance of noise‐induced sleep disturbances in relation to health and well‐being, is also controversial. The hypothesized causal connection between acoustical stimulation and the occurrence of disorders, includes primary‐effects (e.g. awakenings) and after‐effects (e.g. changes in mood or performance). To date, it has not been feasible to determine late after‐effects, such as health disorders. The most often reported sociopsychological effect of noise is general annoyance, whereby annoyance is defined as disturbance of communication, rest, recreation or concentration. Some results indicate a higher sensitivity of critical groups (e.g. old people, the sick, children, pregnant women).",

      "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a frequent head injury, one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and a global health issue. TBI is defined as a direct physical impact to the head, and it elicits physical, cognitive, psychological, psychosocial and functional impairments. TBI can be associated with a fatal outcome. In addition, TBI is related to high healthcare costs, long term rehabilitations, prolonged sick-leaves, and social and functional disability. The conflicts around the globe have facilitated the development of complications after TBI, especially in combat veterans, but also in civilians affected by conflicts and combat situations. The severity of TBI might vary from mild to moderate and severe forms of TBI. The complications of TBI include cognitive dysfunctions, posttraumatic epilepsy, headaches and other motor and sensory neurological impairments. There are two phases of TBI: primary (a head injury) and secondary (a biological response to primary TBI). The understanding of the pathophysiology of the secondary TBI is still unclear. Biological processes that develop after TBI are the result of the organism response to the primary TBI, and they include activation of the inflammatory mediators and secretion of neurotransmitters, the development of apoptosis or necrosis, regenerative processes and altered synaptic plasticity. The main goal in TBI research is to improve the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to the secondary TBI, to develop biomarkers that would be used to monitor the severity of injury, to find new targets (new molecules) for treatment and to have biomarkers that would follow the treatment response to reduce mortality and physical, cognitive, psychological, psychosocial and functional impairments after TBI, and to improve the clinical outcome.",

      "title": "Developmental coordination disorder continues to evolve",
      "abstract": "Motor coordination has classically been understood in terms of harnessing degrees of freedom and performance variables in the neuro-musculo-skeletal system. In clinical examination, however, coordination is often seen as resulting from a selective contribution to sensorimotor processing by proprioceptive, vestibular input and cerebellar modulation. Therefore, impaired coordination (often described as ataxia) typically rules out other causes such as muscle weakness, abnormal muscle tone, disrupted motor planning, or the occurrence of involuntary movements. This is both a great strength and a difficulty in clinical neurology: many descriptors are based on phenomenological observation, but also have a localizing connotation. For example, dystonia is not any one type of muscle tone impairment, as implied by etymology, but reflects basal ganglia dysfunction. It is distinct from spasticity, which indicates abnormal corticospinal tract function.1 Similarly, aphasia (literally absence of speech) does not overlap with anarthria (absence of articulated speech) but refers to language difficulties that can be traced to other brain regions. Yet, the clinico-anatomical approach is less accurate or is inappropriate when clinical signs relate to brain development.2 In this context, replacing the privative prefix ‘a’ by ‘dys’ sometimes serves to denote the developmental character and signal differences in presentation, clinico-anatomical correlation, outcome, and management needs, as in (developmental) ‘dysphasia’ versus (acquired) ‘aphasia’, or ‘dyspraxia’ versus ‘apraxia’. Growing interest in neurodevelopmental conditions has led many clinicians and researchers to move beyond these semantic considerations. They have adopted a more pragmatic approach to define more useful frameworks for understanding the complexity at stake and assessing intervention approaches. The developmental coordination disorder (DCD) construct has thus emerged to describe a comprehensive developmental condition in which impairments in a child's capacity to develop and execute coordinated motor skills cannot be explained by cognitive or sensory dysfunction or other neurological conditions. In DCD, the hallmark ‘coordination disorder’ is inclusive and not specifically clinico-anatomically localizing. The construct has superseded the restrictive characterization of dyspraxia. Therefore, dyspraxia could potentially be used to address an overlooked aspect of the complex motor phenotype in other defined neurodevelopmental disorders, whether generic (e.g. autism spectrum disorder or cerebral palsy) or specific (e.g. neurogenetic syndromes), which has not been common practice. In many clinical situations, DCD has also proved more relevant than previous concepts based on supposed minimal brain lesions or dysfunction. In 2012, Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology (DMCN) published the outcome of a several-year-long effort by the European Academy of Childhood Disability (EACD) to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, assessment, and management of DCD. These recommendations were based on sound appraisal of the body of studies available then and endeavoured to translate results into good clinical practice. The recommendations have been very influential in clinical practice worldwide. They have also further shaped and clarified the DCD concept for the provision of service and for clinical research. A wealth of new studies published since then have brought valuable insights into motor performance, executive functions, cognition, visual functioning, mental health, other aspects of ‘comorbidity’, quality of life, assessment, as well as clues to pathophysiology and the potential for improving outcomes.3, 4 The way we approach DCD has also changed. To cite but one example relating to nosology, the fifth and latest revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) now lists DCD as a main disorder under a new ‘Neurodevelopmental Disorders’ cluster. In this issue of DMCN, we present the fully updated EACD recommendations,5 which marks an important, historic step in the understanding and treatment of DCD. We expect these recommendations to improve identification, evaluation, and management of this condition. Hopefully, they will continue to enhance the current practical relevance of the DCD construct and contribute to our evolving understanding of DCD in the wider context of developmental disorders.",

Frequently, it is of little clinical importance, but in some conditions there may be profound disturbance of autonomic function, including orthostatic hypotension, impairment of heart rate and bladder control, and impotence. Some autonomic neuropathies are of acute onset, but most are chronic and of gradual onset. Diseases that primarily affect small fibers in peripheral nerves or cause acute demyelination of small myelinated fibers are those most likely to cause autonomic dysfunction. Conditions that cause severe autonomic dysfunction include acute dysautonomia, familial and primary amyloidosis. Guillain-Barre syndrome, diabetes, porphyria, Chagas' disease, and some hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies. Management consists of treating the underlying cause and symptomatic therapy.",

      "abstract": "Reflex seizures (RS) are epileptic events that are objectively and consistently elicited in response to a specific afferent stimulus or by an activity of the patient. The specific stimulus can be a variety of heterogenous intrinsic or extrinsic factors, ranging from the simple to the complex, such as flashing lights or reading a book. These seizures can take a variety of forms, comprising either general or focal onset, with or without secondary generalization. Reflex epilepsies (RE) are classified as a specific syndrome in which all epileptic seizures are precipitated by sensory stimuli. The few designated RE include idiopathic photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy, other visual sensitive epilepsies, primary reading epilepsy, and startle epilepsy. RS that occurs within other focal or generalized epilepsy syndromes that are associated with distinct spontaneous seizures are classified by the overarching seizure type. Most patients experience spontaneous seizures along with their provoked events. RS originate from stimulation of functional anatomic networks normally functioning for physiological activities, that overlap or coincide with regions of cortical hyperexcitability. Generalized RS typically occur within the setting of IGEs and should be considered as focal seizures with quick secondary generalization via cortico-cortical or cortico-reticular pathways. In aggregate, activation of a critical neuronal mass, supported and sustained by cortico-subcortical and thalamocortical pathways eventually result in a seizure. Treatment includes antiseizure medication, commonly valproate or levetiracetam, along with lifestyle modifications, and when amenable, surgical intervention. High clinical suspicion and careful history taking must be employed in all epilepsy patients to identify reflex triggers.",

An important portion of the history in a primary care evaluation is the psychiatric history and the mental status examination. When evaluating a patient for mental or emotional disorders, history is truly everything. Often, the practitioner must ask specific questions to assess the presence of common mental disorders in order to supplement other information or because the patient does not recognize or does not volunteer the symptoms. Casting ones net for the symptoms of common mental disorders, including the category of anxiety disorders, is extremely helpful to fully assess a patient’s emotional and physical status. Disorders that comorbidly occur may further complicate matters, especially if common symptoms are shared. For example, shared symptoms of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder include worrying, poor concentration, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and somatic concerns. An appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan can be instituted only after the clinical symptoms and signs are fully recognized and evaluated. The information in this book is applicable to evaluations of adult patients, age 18 years or older, although sections may be applicable to younger patients.

Central monoaminergic (noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic) neural networks, limbic structures, the sympathoadrenal system, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the immune system are considered the most important stress pathways. Their activation determines stress reactivity and pathological consequences on exposure to situations of distress. Both trauma and long-term stress can cause alterations in the activities of neuroanatomical structures and neural networks within the central nervous system. These neurohormonal changes are associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a disturbance thought to be one of the most serious psychiatric illnesses. PTSD may develop in individuals after exposure to a traumatic event (war, violence, accident) and is manifested by various symptoms, such as re-experiencing, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, impaired memory of the event, sleep disorders, nightmares, panic attacks, and depression.

      "title": "Touching the unconscious in the unconscious – hypnotic communication with unconscious patients",
      "abstract": "If hypnosis means contact to the unconscious to modulate psychological and physiological functions by means of suggestions, and if this is facilitated by attenuation of the critical mind, then the question arises as to whether suggestions also have an effect when waking consciousness is otherwise eliminated, namely by coma or anesthesia. A prerequisite would be perception, which actually is evidenced by reports of patients after traumatic brain injury, artificial coma, resuscitation or general anesthesia. Moreover, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently observed after these medical situations is hardly explainable without some sort of awareness under such conditions. Even advanced neurophysiological diagnostic cannot yet rule out consciousness or sensory processing. Especially reference to perception during unconsciousness is given by the results of a recent multicenter study on the effects of hypnotic communication with patients under controlled adequate deep general anesthesia. The observed reductions in incidence and severity of postoperative pain, opioid use, nausea and vomiting cannot be explained by the reaction of a few but only by a considerable proportion of patients. This leads to a strong plea for a more careful treatment of unconscious patients in the emergency room, operating theater or intensive care unit, for the abandonment of the restriction of therapeutic communication to awake patients, and for new aspects of communication and hypnosis research. Obviously, loss of consciousness does not protect against psychological injury, and continuation of communication is needed. But how and what to talk to unconscious patients? Generally addressing the unconscious mind with suggestions that generally exert their effects unconsciously, hypnotic communication appears to be the adequate language. Especially addressing meaningful topics, as derived from the basic psychological needs and known stressors, appears essential. With respect to negative effects by negative or missing communication or to the proposed protective and supporting effects of therapeutic communication with patients clinically rated as unconscious, the role of consciousness is secondary. For the effects of perceived signals and suggestions it does not matter whether consciousness is absent, or partial, or unrecognized present.",

      "abstract": "Detailed history taking is of paramount importance to establish a reliable diagnosis in patients with transient loss of consciousness. In this article the clinical symptoms and signs of the successive phases of a syncopal episode are reviewed. A failure of the systemic circulation to perfuse the brain sufficiently results in a stereotyped progression of neurological symptoms and signs culminating in loss of consciousness; when transient, this is syncope. Prior to loss of consciousness the affected individual tends to exhibit unclear thinking, followed by fixation of the eyes in the midline and a 'frozen' appearance. Narrowing of the field of vision with loss of colour vision ('greying' out) and finally a complete loss of vision (hence 'blacking' out) occurs. Hearing loss may occur following loss of vision. This process may take as little as approximately 7 s in cases of sudden complete circulatory arrest (e.g. abrupt asystole), but in other circumstances it may take longer depending on the rate and depth of cerebral hypoperfusion. Complete loss of consciousness occurs with the 'turning up' of the eyeballs. Profound cerebral hypoperfusion may be accompanied by myoclonic jerks.",

In other words, the myopathies are those conditions in which the patient’s symptoms and signs can be attributed to a pathological process affecting either the structure of muscle fibres or their associated interstitial tissues, or to disturbance of the biochemical or electrophysiological function of those fibres. Myopathies are rare in all age ranges. They may be inherited or acquired. Onset of inherited myopathies in the elderly, not surprisingly, is uncommon, but some of these diseases are asymptomatic or cause such minor symptoms that their significance is not appreciated by the patient, and thus they may not be recognized until late on in life. Their recognition may have implications for other, younger, family members. Many of the acquired myopathies afflicting the elderly are treatable, but the commonest, inclusion body myositis, is not, and incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate use of steroids may compound morbidity.",

These disorders arise at the intersection of lesion-related brain dysfunction and psychological distress related to the event and its aftermath, making it difficult to identify what symptom is a direct physiological consequence of the stroke. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, apathy, emotionalism, and anger are the most common of these syndromes, and posttraumatic stress disorder related to the stroke event has become increasingly recognized as a relevant entity. Mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis are less commonly encountered but potentially highly debilitating conditions that may be underrecognized. Early identification and treatment may mitigate functional impairment and improve quality of life. Evidence-based guidelines from the general population are often relied upon to guide treatment. Further research is needed to understand and tailor treatment of these disorders in the poststroke population.",

These disorders reflect pathological processes in the central nervous system and are an important predictor of the social functioning recovery of patients. The question of the deficit structure remains open. In some cases, cognitive impairments are detected in early school age, in others, they appear only in adolescence. At the disease onset, there is a sharp deterioration in cognitive functioning. Further change is also heterogeneous: the same cognitive functions can either remain stable, or deteriorate or improve. To further study the cognitive deficit, it is necessary to distinguish more homogeneous groups based on both clinical parameters, and on the results of performing cognitive tests. It is important for the future of the concept of cognitive deficit to correlate it with the usual conceptualizations, including pathopsychological symptom groups.",

      "title": "Alien Hand Syndrome: Ethical Issues",
      "abstract": "Abstract At the nexus of theories of mind and the science of the brain is alien hand syndrome, a rare neurologic disorder in which one hand displays complex nonvolitional behaviours. The causative lesion disconnects brain regions that initiate hand movement from those needed for conscious recognition of volition. The aberrant behaviours may be unwilled and automatic, or in other cases they may be unconsciously willed yet unrecognised as the patient's own. Although sometimes touted as proof that free will does not exist, scientific descriptions of alien hand phenomenon are neutral in regard to competing philosophical theories attributing human decision to free agency or to determined physical processes. How one thinks about the nature of free will is important for ethics, which respects the validity of personal autonomy in moral decision making. Demonstration that some purposeful actions may be unwilled does not mean that all thoughts are predetermined. Therefore, neuroscientific explanations of alien hand syndrome can help to inform but do not dismantle traditional approaches to biomedical ethics. Key Concepts: Alien hand syndrome is a neurologic condition in which the affected hand exhibits complex nonvolitional behaviours. It results from disconnection of brain regions that control the hand from those that signal conscious recognition of volition. Other clinical examples of complex involuntary behaviours are recognised. Purposeful yet nonvolitional behaviour calls into question common understandings of free will. If no human decisions were freely made, then the ethical principle of respect for autonomy would be meaningless. Personal culpability for unwilled harmful actions is ethically and legally diminished. Just because some actions may be unwilled does not mean that all are. Scientific accounts of alien hand syndrome are philosophically neutral with respect to theories of agency versus determinism. Some instances of alien hand syndrome may be a form of agnosia of agency.",

Main issues of anaesthetic concerns are difficult airway, altered respiratory mechanics, myopathy, gastric reflux,interaction of poly- pharma therapy for seizures and anaesthetic agents, associated cardiovascular disorders. The response to general anae- sthesia with sevoflurane and muscle relaxants and its postoperative outcomes were observed in these unreported cases. Abstract Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) occurs when the band of tissue connecting the two hemispheres of the brain does not develop typically in utero. It has been correlated with inherited genetic factors, prenatal infec- tion or injuries, prenatal toxic exposures, structural blockage by cysts or other brain abnormalities, metabo- lic disorders fetal alcohol syndrome, craniofacial ab- normalities, and chromosome errors such as unequal chromosome x inactivation or deletion of the short arm of Chromosome 1 1 . It is diagnosed sometimes acciden- tally presenting with a broad range of clinical manifesta- tions and no unique prognosis. 2 The clinical features most commonly seen in patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum are microcephaly, macrocephaly, seizures, developmen- tal delay or retardation, hypotonia, spasticity and multi- ple somatic anomalies including arthrogryposis, eye anomalies, syringomyelia in the spinal cord and facial dysmorphisms. 3 Some syndromes that frequently inclu- de ACC are Aicardi syndrome, Andermann syndro- 4 .

Predisposing factors are a history of sexual or physical abuse, psychiatric disorders, previous episodes of functional coma, and recent surgery with general anesthesia. Several clinical signs are suggestive for the diagnosis, however none of them is sufficiently sensitive or specific. Therefore, functional coma remains an exclusion diagnosis. Vital signs must be normal, just as a routine blood examination, an electroencephalogram and imaging of the central nervous system.

      "title": "Does the Patient Have Abnormal Movements at Night?",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders are generally characterized by simple movements that disturb sleep or the ability to fall asleep. These disorders manifest symptoms of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness or tiredness. In order to make an accurate diagnosis, an all-night video recording is desired to differentiate these disorders from parasomnias. Sleep-related movement disorders or congenital simple movements can cause disturbed sleep. All-night recordings are recommended to differentiate the sleep-related movement disorder from parasomnias. Patients are usually unaware of movements or sleep disturbance. Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders are repetitive and stereotyped with rhythmic motor behaviors. These movements occur during drowsiness or early sleep and involve large muscle groups and include body rocking, head rolling, or head banging. They are more common in children and infants. In most situations, they do not have any significant consequences. Many sleep-related movement disorders are a result of a medical condition due to side effects or withdrawal from medication or a substance, or they could be an isolated symptom or normal variant. Many of these disorders of movement tend to overlap with other sleep conditions including parasomnias. In general, parasomnias are undesirable physical events that occur when falling asleep, during sleep, or while waking up. They include abnormal sleep-related complex movements, behaviors, and autonomic nervous system activity. They significantly contrast with sleep-related movement disorders. Parasomnias tend to result in injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Sometimes they affect the patient, the bed partner, or both. Non-REM-related parasomnias include confused arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Patients tend to have a partial or complete amnesia for episodes. REM-related parasomnias include a REM behavior disorder also known as RBD. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged to elderly males. However, it is often associated with an underlying neurologic disorder such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, narcolepsy, cerebrovascular accident, or Lewy body dementia. Nightmare disorder is apparent during rapid eye movement sleep and often leads to awakening with a bowel movement. While prevalent in the general population, this is common in children. Nightmares are frequently associated with psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder. The patient remembers the dreams and can describe the nightmare, which usually involves threats to survival, security, or physical activity. Nightmares can have a negative impact on family functioning and lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or low energy. It can also impair occupational or educational functions.",

En d’autres termes les sujets ayant des caracteristiques alexithymiques ont des difficultes a identifier et a exprimer le stress emotionnel par la verbalisation. L’alexithymie fut initialement consideree comme de survenue plus frequente chez les sujets souffrants de maladies dites psychosomatiques. Certaines etudes ont retrouve des anomalies du systeme immunitaire notamment de l’immunite a mediation cellulaire ou une hyperactivite du systeme sympathique ou une perturbation de la secretion des corticoides mais tres peu ont essaye d’avoir une approche psychoneuroimmunologique en integrant toutes ces voies (immunes et neuroendocrines) lors des investigations sur l’alexithymie. Les objectifs de cette these etaient d’explorer de maniere plus approfondie le systeme immunitaire en tenant compte de l’activite du systeme sympathique et des taux seriques de cortisol. Nous avons emis l’hypothese que les alexithymiques presenteraient une baisse de l’immunite a mediation cellulaire avec une chute de la secretion de cytokines de type 1 associee a une elevation des taux seriques de cortisol et une augmentation de l’activite du systeme sympathique. Lors d’une etude longitudinale, nous avons compare - entre un groupe de sujets alexithymiques et un groupe de sujets non alexithymiques – les concentrations seriques des sous-populations lymphocytaires (CD4, CD8), la production de l’interleukine 1 (IL-1), de l’interleukine 2 (IL-2), de l’interleukine 4 (IL-4) et de son recepteur soluble (sIL-4R) et de l’interleukine 10 (IL-10) par les lymphocytes actives par PHA ainsi que la reponse cardiovasculaire (frequence cardiaque et tension arterielle) et le taux serique de cortisol. Cinquante et une femmes âgees de 18 a 27 ans ont ete incluses (27 femmes alexithymiques et 24 non alexithymiques) en fonction de leur score a l’echelle de la Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Sur les femmes initialement vues la premiere annee (n=38) 26 ont ete incluses a un an Initialement nous avons constate chez les alexithymiques une diminution significative de la production d’interleukine-1 (IL-1), d’IL-2, d’IL-4 produites par lymphocytes actives par Phytohemagglutinine A (PHA) ainsi que du ratio Th1/Th2 (IL-2/IL-10) avec une baisse du ratio de CD4/CD8 et du pourcentage de CD4 et de lymphocytes. Les alexithymiques presentaient une plus grande elevation de la pression arterielle sans modification du taux serique de cortisol. Un an plus tard il y avait toujours une diminution significative chez les alexithymiques comparativement aux non alexithymiques de la production d’IL-2, d’IL-4 et du pourcentage de CD4 avec une tendance a la baisse du ratio CD4/CD8. Bien que l’anxiete etait plus elevee initialement dans le groupe d’alexithymiques, les resultats persistaient a un an en depit d’un retour a la normal du niveau d’anxiete a l’echelle HAD. Ces resultats suggerent que les femmes alexithymiques pourraient presenter un systeme immunitaire affaibli avec une atteinte predominante de la voie Th1 de l’immunite mais non exclusive. Cette dysregulation immunitaire pourrait etre liee a une hyperactivite du systeme sympathique. Il pourrait y avoir chez les alexithymiques un facteur de vulnerabilite aux maladies infectieuses et a celles liees au stress.",

      "abstract": "<b>Abstract:</b> Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndromic label for people with informant-corroborated memory problems and evidence of memory impairment on formal testing in the absence of more pervasive deficits in cognition and functional abilities. It is often described as a “risk factor” for dementia though this is misleading; patients with the first signs of Alzheimer9s disease (AD) will meet the criteria for MCI and as their illness progresses they will move to more traditional criteria for dementia (eg, DSM). Importantly though, they have not changed or “converted” from one disease to another. The problem with MCI clinically, and hence the reason why all such patients are not simply diagnosed with very mild AD is that as one moves closer to normal performance (ie, not clearly demented), the risk of patients who do not have AD (eg, so-called “worried well”; depression; alternate degenerative or non-degenerative pathology) being captured by the MCI syndrome increases. Furthermore, although the concept of MCI seems straightforward, “absence of dementia” or “intact cognition in domains other than memory” or even “objective evidence of memory impairment” varies according to the methods used to define each criterion. Nevertheless, with longitudinal follow-up to confirm that initial MCI status was due to incipient AD, this syndrome offers a important window to examine the earliest symptomatic stages of the disease. Emerging evidence from such studies have highlighted that incipient (MCI-stage) AD is underpinned by degeneration of an interconnected neural circuit including mesial temporal lobe, diencephalon and posterior cingulate regions—all of which, interestingly, have been implicated in memory processing from focal lesion studies in humans.",

      "abstract": "The neuropathology associated with cognitive decline in military personnel exposed to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and chronic stress is incompletely understood. Few studies have examined clinicopathologic correlations between phosphorylated-tau neurofibrillary tangles, β-amyloid neuritic plaques, neuroinflammation, or white matter (WM) lesions, and neuropsychiatric disorders in veterans. We describe clinicopathologic findings in 4 military veterans with early-onset dementia (EOD) who had varying histories of blunt- and blast-TBI, cognitive decline, behavioral abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, and suicide. We found that pathologic lesions in these military-EOD cases could not be categorized as classic Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy, traumatic axonal injury, or other well-characterized clinicopathologic entities. Rather, we observed a mixture of polypathology with unusual patterns compared with pathologies found in AD or other dementias. Also, ultrahigh resolution ex vivo MRI in 2 of these 4 brains revealed unusual patterns of periventricular WM injury. These findings suggest that military-EOD cases are associated with atypical combinations of brain lesions and distribution rarely seen in nonmilitary populations. Future prospective studies that acquire neuropsychiatric data before and after deployments, as well as genetic and environmental exposure data, are needed to further elucidate clinicopathologic correlations in military-EOD.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is a specific psychosocial result of a complex neurobiological process in the existence of individuals. As pharmacologically term addiction arises from creation of physiological adaptation to the substance and with occurrence of withdrawal syndrome in the moment of cessation of both substance intake and effect of the substance. With psychobiological disorders created as a result of such adaptations, addiction becomes the illness of central nervous system. Persistent and compulsive usage is created through forming of long term associative memory in several neural networks including prefrontal cortex. 'Pathological usurpation of neural of learning and memory mechanisms, which normally serve to shape behavior connected to the reward as well as a signal for prediction of reward' Defining one phenomenon with addiction term requires application of medical model. Therefore illness is defined before all with existence of stable pathological signs and symptoms, which are expressed through dysfunction of some organs and followed by individual experience of torment and misery of individuals. Symptoms have to have stable and regular occurrence with large number of patients and make one clinical picture. This allows diagnostics, classification and requires treatment. Outcome of the addiction and future career /destiny of the addict largely is connected with his/her primary bio-psychological potentials and possible other diagnosis besides addiction. Therefore, therapeutic possibilities in treatment of addictions are determined by the use of pharmaco-therapeutic means, but in many cases they are determined by society’s attitude towards psychoactive substance and addicts. Namely, the goals of treatment depend on it, as well as different modalities of rehabilitation and social reintegration of addicts. This paper analyzes forms of treatment and rehabilitation of addicts, it also estimates theoretical forecast of treatment possibilities with realistically realized therapeutic programs.",

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

In settings associated with litigation/disability evaluation, the rate of malingering may be as high as 30%, but its frequency in clinical practice is not known. We describe the main characteristics of deliberate deception (factitious disorders and malingering) and ways that neurologists might detect symptom exaggeration. The key to establishing that the extent or severity of reported symptoms does not truly represent their severity is to elicit inconsistencies in different domains, but it is not possible to determine whether the reports are intentionally inaccurate. Neurological disorders where difficulty in determining the degree of willed exaggeration is most likely include functional weakness and movement disorders, post-concussional syndrome (or mild traumatic brain injury), psychogenic non-epileptic attacks and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (especially when there is an associated functional movement disorder). Symptom amplification or even fabrication are more likely if the patient might gain benefit of some sort, not necessarily financial. Techniques to detect deception in medicolegal settings include covert surveillance and review of social media accounts. We also briefly describe specialised psychological tests designed to elicit effort from the patient.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Confusion is a non-specific, non-diagnostic term to describe a patient with disorientation, impaired memory, or abnormal thought process. Agitation describes an increased level of psychomotor activity, and anxious or aggressive behaviour. Many agitated patients may also be delirious, yet they only represent a minority of all delirious patients. ICU delirium is an acute cognitive disorder of both consciousness and content of thought. The hallmark of ICU delirium is a fluctuating mental status, inattention, and an altered level of consciousness. Delirium is the end product of a sequence of insults and injury that lead to a common measurable manifestation of end-organ brain injury. It does not have a single aetiology, but often has multiple different and potentially interacting aetiologies. Both non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors play important roles in the development of delirium. Importantly, the new onset of delirium should prompt the physician to investigate the underlying cause. Cognitive impairment and age are among the most important non-modifiable risk factors, whereas administration of benzodiazepines is the greatest. The alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine shows promise as a sedative reducing the risk for delirium when compared with benzodiazepines.",

Self-injurious behavior or compulsion refers to any voluntary action resulting in self-damage. Compulsive disorders are characterized by repetitive, persistent, or sustained behaviors in excess of what is required for normal function, especially if severe enough to interfere with normal function. Cutaneous compulsions (psychodermatoses) often have an underlying organic disease or trigger. Diagnosis and treatment include identifying the underlying trigger, treating secondary dermatoses, and modifying behavior to prevent recurrence; medications are a helpful adjunct if anxiety interferes with normal activities or learning. Dermatoses may be initiated by a pathology, with subsequent self-injury causing persistence or worsening of lesions. Basic work-up to rule out medical causes of self-injurious behavior include evaluation for pain or pruritus, including musculoskeletal disease, neurologic disease, and/or primary dermatologic disease.",

      "abstract": "At first glance, acute grief would not seem to be a medical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. Bereavement or the sudden cessation of social interaction seems to be of special interest because it is often cited among the alleged psychogenic factors in psychosomatic disorders. The enormous increase in grief reactions due to war casualties, furthermore, demands an evaluation of their probable effect on the mental and physical health of our population. The points to be made in this paper are as follows: i. Acute grief is a definite syndrome with psychological and somatic symptomatology. 2. This syndrome may appear immediately after a crisis; it may be delayed; it may be exaggerated or apparently al)sent. 3. In place of the typical syndrome there may appear distorted pictures, each of which represents one special aspect of the grief syndrome. 4. By appropriate techniques these distorted pictures can be successfully transformed into a normal grief reaction with resolution. Our observations comprise tot patients. Included are (i) psychoneurotic patients who lost a relative during the course of treatment, (2) relatives of patients who uied in the hospital, (3) bereaved disaster victims (Cocoanut Grove Fire) and their close relatives, ( ) relatives of members of the armed forces.",

Description of clinical case C. is a 14 teenager who comes to a mental health center for the first time a year ago for having numerous self-injuries in the forearm. She says that she cannot avoid doing so in moments of anxiety and that, in addition, when she is hurt she calms down. Throughout the interviews, C. relates that after the death of her best friend in a traffic accident she is alone and with episodes of anxiety. Exploration and complementary tests It is important to analyze the risk factors of self-injurious behaviors in adolescence such as: – personal characteristic; – psychiatric disorders; – family characteristics; – mass media. Diagnosis Depressive episode (F32). Differential diagnosis In general, self-injury is considered as a symptom or characteristic of a specific psychiatric disorder. Stereotyped self-injury is characteristic of processes of cognitive deficit of the level of severe and profound mental retardation. Compulsive self-harm involves symptomatic habits such as severe scratching of the skin or already differentiated psychiatric entities, such as trichotillomania, onicofagia or delusional parasitosis… Important psychotic disorder. Conclusions Following the Task Force's criteria, in relation to probably effective therapies, it can be concluded that the therapy based on mentation for adolescents (MBT-A) is the first effective treatment for the treatment of self-harm in adolescents.

      "abstract": "Alexithymia is a deficit in the recognition, expression and regulation of emotions, which has the following features: difficulty in identifying or describing feelings, difficulty distinguishing between feelings and bodily sensations, stringent imaginal processes, and externally oriented cognitive style. This personality trait is associated with many psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders, as well as with risky behaviors.To investigate whether this trait is also associated with reduced memory for emotional information.A review of articles investigating the possible damage caused by alexithymia to implicit and explicit memory for emotional information was conducted.Although the studies concerning implicit memory presented divergent results, most studies on explicit memory suggested a deficit for emotional information retention in high-alexithymia individuals.The reviewed data support the notion that the typical increase in episodic memory for emotional information is reduced in high-alexithymia individuals.A alexitimia é um déficit no reconhecimento, expressão e regulação das emoções, que possui as seguintes características: dificuldade em identificar sentimentos, dificuldade em descrever sentimentos, dificuldade em distinguir sentimentos e sensações corporais, processos de imaginação dificultados e estilo de cognição externamente orientado. Este traço de personalidade está associado a muitos transtornos psiquiátricos e psicossomáticos, bem como a comportamentos de risco aumentados.Investigar se este traço também está associado a redução de memória para informações emocionais.Artigos que investigam os possíveis danos causados ​​pela alexitimia na memória implícita e explícita para informações emocionais foram revisados.Embora os estudos sobre memória implícita tenham apresentado resultados divergentes, a maioria dos estudos sobre memória explícita sugeriu déficits na retenção de informação emocional em indivíduos com altos índices de alexitimia.Os dados revisados ​​sugerem que o aumento típico na memória episódica para informações emocionais é reduzido em indivíduos com alta alexitimia.",

      "title": "Schizotypy, schizotypic psychopathology and schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "The term schizotypy refers to a latent personality organization that putatively harbors the liability for schizophrenia and can give rise to a variety of schizophrenia-related phenotypic outcomes1, 2. This personality organization, which is determined by any number of as-yet-unknown schizophrenia-related genetic influences acting against a background of polygenic assets and liabilities as well as impacts from the environment (e.g., stressors, epigenetic inputs), can manifest itself variously at the phenotypic level, ranging from clinically diagnosable schizophrenia through pathological personality manifestations (e.g., schizotypal, paranoid, avoidant and schizoid personality disorders) to subtle, sub-clinical psychotic-like phenomenology (e.g., perceptual aberrations, magical ideation, referential thinking, interpersonal aversiveness). Schizotypy may also manifest itself in an imperceptible manner, undetectable by the unaided naked eye, through deviance on endophenotypes that have established valid relations with schizophrenia. Moreover, schizotypy as a latent construct (personality organization) is centrally embedded in a diathesis-stressor theoretical model that has considerable utility as an organizing framework for the study of schizophrenia, schizophrenia-related psychopathology (e.g., delusional disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified, schizotypal, paranoid and other related personality disorders) as well as putative schizophrenia endophenotypes, a view I have advocated for several decades3-6. Note, the term schizotypy is not restricted to describe only those clinical manifestations that are associated with schizotypal personality disorder2, 5, 6. Nor is the term reserved to indicate a methodological preference, e.g. for self-report psychometric assessments. Rather, schizotypy can be assessed using a variety of approaches such as interviews, psychometric inventories, familial risk and/or laboratory measures. Schizotypic persons may indeed display some of the phenomenology associated with schizotypal personality disorder, but they may also show other features6-8. There is a long history of describing clinical states bearing the imprint of schizotypy and an implicit connection to schizophrenia liability, including observations by Kraepelin, Bleuler, Rado, Meehl, Gottesman and myself. It has been argued that a clear demarcation in an underlying schizophrenia liability continuum (e.g., a pronounced threshold effect or discontinuity) is required to explain the emergence of schizotypic indicators in psychological functioning. An alternative position regarding schizotypy holds that it is a dimension of normal personality, not necessarily connected to schizophrenia liability, and representing something of a \"healthy\" personality factor. However, observers of schizophrenia and schizotypic psychopathology, in the main, do not view schizotypy as benign or reflective of healthy psychological adjustment. Non-psychotic schizotypic states (defined using clinical, laboratory and/or familial risk) have been associated with a wide range of findings, including sustained attention deficits, working memory deficits, smooth pursuit eye movement dysfunction, schizophrenia-related psychometric deviance on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), executive functioning deficits, dysfunctional anti-saccade performance, subtle formal thought disorder, clinical schizotypal and paranoid personality features, schizophrenia-related social cognition deficits, exteroceptive and proprioceptive somatosensory deficits, psychomotor abnormalities, and candidate polymorphisms (e.g., ZNF804A, Val158Met-COMT, neuregulin-1). That schizotypic persons manifest such a panorama of deficits, similar in nature albeit less in degree to those seen in schizophrenia, argues for a connection or common underlying construct for conditions defined phenotypically (i.e., schizotypic subjects vs. schizophrenia-affected subjects). An area of continued speculation concerns the underlying structure of schizotypy and the precise nature of the variation expressed in that latent construct. Considerable statistical evidence, using a variety of latent structure methods, points to the existence of possible underlying discontinuities or severe threshold effects in schizotypy, and work in this area continues. Such evidence stimulates the caveat, to wit, that the use of continuous measures to assess phenotypic manifestations of schizotypy does not ipso facto mean that the underlying (or latent) schizotypy construct is fully quantitative or uniformly graded by degree. The course and clinical outcome for those designated as harboring schizotypy remains an area of active inquiry. It is entirely conceivable that many individuals possessing schizotypy may traverse the life course escaping psychotic illness as well as other diagnosable schizotypic manifestations. The expectation that some people validly at risk for schizophrenia may never manifest the illness is well established in the reality of discordant monozygotic twins, in which one twin is affected by schizophrenia and the co-twin is not psychotic (perhaps not even diagnosable as having a non-psychotic, but detectable, clinical schizotypic condition like schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder). Individuals that achieve elevated scores on psychometric measures of schizotypy have been shown to be at increased risk for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related psychoses later in life, as well as a variety of other related outcomes. Such individuals also display poorer psychosocial functioning, lower rates of marriage, increased use of psychiatric medications, and increased utilization of psychiatric services2. It is entirely conceivable that many individuals designated as \"prodromal\" for schizophrenia, but who do not convert to schizophrenia (which is 60-70% of such subjects), are in fact harboring schizotypy and will, even if not psychotic, show impairments across the life span, perhaps adopting an eccentric or odd manner of personality functioning. The schizotypy model has helped to adjust the boundaries of schizophrenia phenotype in the DSM-5 (e.g., schizotypal pathology is now included with schizophrenia). Furthermore, illuminating the nature of schizotypy may aid in unraveling the current puzzle of the very low conversion to schizophrenia rates seen in \"prodromal\" schizophrenia research9. Finally, I have argued that the schizotypy framework may be useful in understanding configurations (rather than simple additive summation) of genes relevant to schizophrenia variants2, an idea that is beginning to gain traction. There is no doubt that incorporation of schizotypy indicators into genomic studies of schizophrenia increase their statistical power. The advantages of a cleaner unit of analysis (the schizotype), free from the effects of medication, institutionalization and neurocognitive decline, are axiomatic. However, the understanding (and misunderstanding) of the schizotypy model as well as alternative approaches to the construct require vigilance, in order to ensure that the approach continues to yield the fruit that it can.

In the acute post-concussion state, it is common to feel irritable, more emotional, and to have difficulty falling asleep, which are non-specific symptoms commonly observed in anxiety disorders. Concussion injuries sometimes occur in a psychically charged environment, which may potentiate acute anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. These disorders can then potentiate prolonged post-concussion persistent symptoms. It is important to differentiate between post-concussion anxiety symptoms and the development of an anxiety disorder. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management, as needed, should address the specific anxiety manifestations.",

Little attention is paid to the condition in doctors' practices, however, and the topic is also hardly mentioned in scientific publications. It is important to distinguish between isolated gustatory loss and gustatory loss in combination with other neurological symptoms. Isolated gustatory loss can be the result of a laesion of the chorda tympani of the facial nerve caused by otitis media or damage to the taste buds, for example. Treatment is aimed at removing the cause, e.g. medication or chronic otitis media, but the treatment options are often limited. Zinc supplementation in patients with zinc deficiency has not been proven to be effective. Gustatory loss in combination with other neurological symptoms is caused by damage to one or more cranial nerves, to the brain stem or cerebral cortex, and is an indication for referral to a neurologist. Early detection of the loss of taste, good patient counselling, diagnostics and possible treatment may limit the negative consequences of this condition.",

      "title": "Aportaciones de aripiprazol en el tratamiento de pacientes agudos con esquizofrenia.",
      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, complejo y heterogeneo que se asocia, generalmente, a un importante deterioro somatico, funcional y de la calidad de vida1. La esquizofrenia no tienen ningun sintoma patognomonico2 y existen otros muchos trastornos psiquiatricos que cursan con sintomas psicoticos que tambien pueden presentarse en la esquizofrenia3. Ademas, no hay pruebas especificas que aseguren su diagnostico en las primeras fases de la enfermedad, y solo el tiempo de evolucion (sintomatologia durante un periodo mas o menos prolongado segun las distintas nosologias) y el curso (en brotes, generalmente con deterioro y afectacion funcional) permiten confirmar el diagnostico de esquizofrenia3. Los sintomas pueden afectar a diversos ambitos psicologicos, pudiendose agrupar en sintomas positivos (delirios y alucinaciones, principalmente), sintomas negativos (pensamiento empobrecido, alogia, deficit volitivo), sintomas afectivos (afecto aplanado, inadecuado; ahedonia, apatia) y sintomas cognitivos (deficits neurocognitivos, estrechamente vinculados al resultado funcional de los pacientes). En general, se acepta clasicamente que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia en la poblacion general es del 1%. Las cifras de prevalencia anual en el ano 1998, recopiladas por varios registros correspondientes a distintas provincias espanolas, coinciden con los valores asumidos de prevalencia mundial, que oscilan aproximadamente entre el 2 y el 4,5 por 1.000 habitantes4. Segun un estudio realizado en Cantabria por Vazquez-Barquero (1995), la incidencia aumenta hasta el 19 por 100.000 (18,8 para los varones y 19,3 para las mujeres) en la poblacion en situacion de riesgo (definida por los autores como aquella con edades comprendidas entre los 15 y los 54 anos)4. Segun las guias clinicas publicadas por la APA2, los objetivos del tratamiento de la fase de agudizacion psicotica interesan de manera primordial a los sintomas positivos: evitar que el paciente sufra lesiones, controlar las alteraciones del comportamiento, disminuir la gravedad de la psicosis y de sus sintomas asociados (delirios, alucinaciones, agitacion, agresividad, angustia) e identificar y analizar los factores desencadenantes del episodio agudo. Se trata ademas de recuperar con rapidez el mejor nivel de funcionamiento, establecer una alianza terapeutica con el paciente y su familia, formular planes de tratamiento a corto y a largo plazo y poner al paciente en contacto con los correspondientes servicios de asistencia ambulatoria. Vale decir que el tratamiento farmacologico instaurado para el manejo y control de estas fases agudas puede determinar el tratamiento de mantenimiento durante los periodos de compensacion clinica, por lo que la eficacia sobre sintomas negativos-afectivos-cognitivos debe ser tenida en cuenta en la eleccion terapeutica, entendiendo asi el abordaje integral de las diferentes fases y problematicas de la esquizofrenia. Durante la fase de estabilizacion, el objetivo principal del tratamiento, ademas del mantenimiento de la compensacion clinica, debe centrarse en continuar el proceso de recuperacion y lograr un mejor funcionamiento y calidad de vida2, y por ello la gran importancia de una buena vinculacion a dispositivos comunitarios, terapias rehabilitadoras, trabajo con las familias, etc. Ademas, en los pacientes que han sufrido dos o mas episodios en los ultimos 5 anos, se recomienda la administracion de medicacion antipsicotica de mantenimiento durante un tiempo indefinido2. En este sentido, los tratamientos antipsicoticos deben sumar a su eficacia un bajo perfil de efectos adversos (tolerancia), ya que cuanto menor sea la presencia de efectos indeseables, mayor sera igualmente la aceptacion subjetiva por el paciente de los farmacos prescritos, factor importante para aumentar la adherencia terapeutica (el 60-70% de los pacientes sin tratamiento de mantenimiento sufre una recaida antes de 1 ano, y este porcentaje aumenta hasta practicamente el 90% en los 2 anos siguientes2).",

The insidious, chronic course of most sleep disorders and lack of patient awareness of signs and symptoms during sleep can complicate the clinical evaluation. Typical chief complaints include snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and behaviors during sleep. Sleep disorders can be primary or secondary to medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is often desirable. Family members can be a critical source of information as they may have observed nocturnal or daytime symptoms unrecognized by the patient. Objective testing plays an important role in assessment for obstructive sleep apnea, parasomnias, and other specific sleep disorders, and can be used most effectively in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation. Nonsleep specialists should consider obtaining assistance from sleep clinicians for more challenging presentations or management of sleep disorders unfamiliar to them.",

Patient's clinical features may support a specific dissociative disorder subtype diagnosis associated with sleep-related episodes, specifically dissociative identity disorder, dissociative fugue, or dissociative disorder NOS.

It is characterised by intrusive thoughts or images (obsessions) which increase anxiety, and by repetitive and ritualistic actions (compulsions) which decrease anxiety. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is frequently complicated by major depressive disorder or other psychiatrics disorders. Unfortunately, it is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated despite the efficacity of treatments by selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors associated with behavioural and cognitive therapy. Diagnosis of this disorder is easy but needs a good knowledge of symptoms because of the clinical heterogeneity.",

      "abstract": "All healthcare professionals dealing primarily with physical disorder need a working knowledge of relevant psychological factors and psychiatric dis­orders. Despite the geographical and, often, cul­tural separation of most ‘general’ (i.e. physical) and psychiatric hospitals, there are close links (1) be­tween physical and psychological disorders, and (2) between physical and psychological factors in the aetiology, presentation, and management of all illness. This chapter aims to stimulate you to think about these issues in primary care and in the general hospital, and to equip you with the know­ledge required to think about them in an integrated, biopsychosocial way. The links between physical and psychological fac­tors are multiple. They include: … ● psychiatric and physical disorders occurring together by chance— as they are both common; ● psychiatric disorders causing physical symptoms— for example, depression is associated with low physical energy (anergia), amenorrhoea, and constipation; ● psychiatric disorder adversely affecting the outcome of physical disorder— for example, a depressive disorder might impair self- management of diabetes mellitus, because low motivation is a common symptom of depression, and may reduce adherence to self- monitoring of glucose; ● psychological factors increasing disability associated with physical disorder— for example, if a patient recovering from a myocardial infarction believes that it has led to a permanent reduction in their cardiac function, they are less likely to return to work, to take regular exercise, and to have a normal sex life; ● untreated psychological problems leading to the inappropriate use of medical resources and to poor compliance with medical advice— for example, people with panic disorder are more likely to attend emergency departments with acute ‘cardiac’ symptoms; ● physical symptoms and disorders having psychological consequences, which include psychiatric disorder— for example, hypothyroidism and cerebrovascular disease may lead to depression; ● physical disorder exacerbating unrelated psychiatric symptoms— for example, a viral infection could delay recovery from a depressive disorder, by impairing the person’s usual activities, at work and at home, which would otherwise provide therapeutic distraction and stimulation.",

Although many methods have been used to measure the presence and severity of cognitive symptoms, little progress has been made in defining and contrasting possible determinants of cognitive dysfunction. We propose a theoretical framework that describes impairments of higher mental functions in terms of both \"extrinsic\" noncognitive processes and \"intrinsic\" cognitive processes. The latter include effort (capacity) demanding processes; automatic processes; episodic (recent biographical) memory; and processes involved in accessing previously acquired knowledge. Noncognitive processes include sensitivity to reinforcement, activation, sensorimotor function, and mood. Each of these processes can be expressed at the time of information acquisition or retrieval from memory. Findings from clinical studies of patients suffering amnestic disorders, progressive dementias, and mood disorders illustrate the utility of such a model for understanding some of the determinants of cognitive dysfunction, for developing diagnostic tools, and for considering therapeutic strategies that may be useful in treating cognitive dysfunctions.",

Some symptoms of the disease, such as auditory hallucinations and delusions, can be ameliorated with drug treatment, whereas other symptoms, such as social withdrawal and cognitive decline, remain uncontrolled. It is possible that these latter symptoms that are often termed ''negative symptoms'' are the result of anatomical and neurochemical abnormalities, whereas those symptoms of the disease such as auditory hallucinations that are termed ''positive symptoms'' may be a result of only neurochemical disorders. The drugs used to treat schizophrenia are designated neuroleptics. The term neuroleptic was chosen to emphasize the similarity of pharmacological profiles of drugs with entirely different chemical structures. Especially prominent features of the effects of neuroleptics include the following: a state of affective indifference; a decrease in locomotor activity; a decrease in excitation, agitation, and aggressiveness; and an antipsychotic action in patients with acute as well as chronic psychoses.",

The first step in the management of memory complaints is to rule out Alzheimer's disease and affective disturbances which could require specific therapeutic measures.

Given the common and essential cellular function of the lysosomal system in different organs and systems, patients afflicted with these disorders present a broad range of clinical problems, including neurological problems, visceromegaly, and skeletal deformities. Onset of symptoms may range from fetal period to adulthood. The neurological problems include developmental delay, seizures, acroparesthesia, motor weakness, muscle wasting, behavioral/psychiatric disturbances, cerebrovascular ischemic events, and extrapyramidal signs. Patients may present with symptoms later that include psychiatric manifestations, are slowly progressive, and may precede other neurologic or systemic features. Most of LSDs are autosomal recessive; however, a few are X-linked with symptpmatic female carriers (e.g., Fabry disease). In most of them, the diagnosis is established by biochemical and/or molecular assays. In terms of management, disease-modifying therapies include enzyme replacement, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and substrate reduction therapy. Patients and their families require genetic counseling regarding reproductive risks, disease prognosis, and therapeutic options. Investigations of disease molecular mechanisms provide insights into potential targets for the development of therapeutic strategies. Supportive care has been the key and essential for most LSDs, resulting in substantial improvement in quality of life of patients and families.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

      "title": "Bipolar depression: the clinical characteristics and unmet needs of a complex disorder",
      "abstract": "Objective: We reviewed important clinical aspects of bipolar depression, a progressive psychiatric condition that is commonly treated in primary care. Bipolar depression is associated with considerable burden of illness, high suicide risk, and greater morbidity and mortality than bipolar mania.Methods: We identified articles relevant to our narrative review using a multistep search of the literature and applying terms that were relevant to bipolar depression or bipolar disorder.Results: Bipolar depression accounts for the majority of time spent unwell for patients with bipolar disorder; high rates of morbidity and mortality arise from full symptomatic episodes and interepisode subsyndromal symptoms. Bipolar depression is an important contributor to long-term dysfunction for patients with bipolar disorder due to psychosocial impairment, loss of work productivity and high rates of substance abuse. Missed and delayed diagnosis is prevalent due to overlapping symptoms with unipolar depression and other diagnoses. Medical comorbidities (i.e. cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome) and psychiatric comorbidities (i.e. anxiety disorder, personality disorder, eating disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) are common. Currently, only three treatments are FDA-approved for bipolar depression; monotherapy antidepressants are not a recommended treatment option.Conclusions: Bipolar disorder is common among primary care patients presenting with depression; it is often treated exclusively in primary care. Clinicians should be alert for symptoms of bipolar disorder in undiagnosed patients, know what symptoms probabilistically suggest bipolar versus unipolar depression, have expertise in providing ongoing treatment to diagnosed patients, and be knowledgeable about managing common medication-related side effects and comorbidities. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is critical.",

      "abstract": "Les états de mal non convulsifs et confusionnels sont classiquement séparés en deux formes, l’état d’absence (EA) et l’état de mal partiel complexe (EMPC). Le diagnostic est difficile sur la base des seuls éléments cliniques et nécessite un électroencéphalogramme (EEG) d’urgence. L’EA ou « petit mal status » est la forme la plus fréquente d’états de mal non convulsifs et confusionnels. Il est caractérisé par une confusion fluctuante, d’intensité variable, souvent associée à des myoclonies périoculaires. L’EEG montre des décharges critiques généralisées qui cèdent sous benzodiazépines alors que la conscience se normalise. Les EA possèdent une importante hétérogénéité nosographique. Quatre groupes peuvent être individualisés : EA typiques s’inscrivant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie généralisée idiopathique, EA atypiques survenant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie généralisée symptomatique ou cryptogénique, EA « de novo » de l’adulte caractérisés par des facteurs de provocation toxiques ou métaboliques, EA avec éléments focaux s’observant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie partielle préexistante. Les EMPC temporaux sont caractérisés par des décharges temporales continues ou récurrentes et peuvent être organisés de façon cyclique, cette présentation étant caractéristique mais rare. Ils nécessitent un traitement énergique en raison de leur résistance et du risque de séquelles cognitives. Les EMPC frontaux constituent un défi diagnostique. Ils sont en effet souvent inauguraux, de présentation clinique déroutante et symptomatiques d’une lésion focale dans un cas sur trois. Nonconvulsive confusional status epilepticus is classically divided on the basis of the ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) into absence status (AS) and complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Based on clinical semiology alone, diagnosis is difficult and requires emergent EEG. AS is a polymorphic condition that can complicate many epileptic syndromes. Confusion of varying intensity is associated in half of the cases with bilateral periocular myoclonias. Clinical and EEG normalization is obtained after intravenous benzodiazepine injection. From a nosographic point of view, four types of AS may be recognized. Typical AS occurs as part of an idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Atypical AS occurs in patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic generalized epilepsies. “De novo” AS of late onset is characterized by toxic or metabolic precipitating factors in middle-aged subjects with no previous history of epilepsy. AS with focal characteristics occur in subjects with a preexisting or newly developing partial epilepsy, most often of extratemporal origin. Most cases are transitional forms between these four entities. CPSE is characterized by continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures, which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. Cyclic disturbance of consciousness characterizes CPSE of temporal lobe origin that requires vigorous treatment to prevent recurrence or cognitive sequelae. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, symptoms are unusual and patients should be documented extensively. A focal frontal lesion is revealed in one third of cases.",

      "title": "Relations of Symptoms to Cognitive Deficits in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is characterized by a variety of cognitive dysfunctions. Information-processing dysfunctions differ between clinical subtypes such that nonparanoid schizophrenia patients attend less than paranoid schizophrenia patients to connotative or contextual aspects of stimuli. The positive and negative symptom dimensions are also associated with distinct cognitive deficits. In general, positive symptoms are related to auditory-processing deficits and negative symptoms to visual/motor dysfunctions. The interaction of frontal and septohippocampal brain systems, and failures of information-processing automaticity and self-monitoring, have been proposed as the bases of positive symptoms. Negative symptoms are thought to arise from abnormalities in the complex interactions of frontal and striatal systems. Recent theoretical analyses have recommended a focus on the cognitive and neuropsychological analysis of specific symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) instead of on the more heterogeneous symptom clusters or dimensions. Studies of specific symptoms indicate that patients with hallucinations have deficits in discriminating the source of information. Delusions have been related to abnormal inference processes as well as abnormal perceptual experiences. Studies should now examine the links between information-processing abnormalities and symptoms over time, as the latter change, within the framework of explicit, disconfirmable theoretical models.",

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

Viele Faktoren konnten verantwortlich sein fur den Spine Verlust, wie ein veranderter pre synaptischer Input oder externe Faktoren und es ist nicht klar ob die pre synaptische Fehlfunktion oder die Postsynaptischen Veranderungen zuerst auftreten. Dennoch ist der Synapsen Verlust nicht spezifisch um Alzheimer vorherzusagen. Viele neurodegenerative Erkrankungen zeigen diese Verluste, ebenso wie es eine Erscheinung des normalen Alterns ist. Jedoch ist es der Haupt Risikofaktor fur Demenz.\r\nSynapsen Verlust ist nicht gleich verteilt in allen Gehirnregionen, was bedeutet, dass alters- abhangige Veranderungen nicht uberall auftreten, aber in bestimmten Regionen, wie im Kortex und im Hippocampus. Korpereigene Kompensationsmechanismen, die den Spine Verlust entgegenwirken und synaptische Kontakte erhalten, konnen nur bedingt gegen die Neurodegeneration halten.\r\nDie Glutamat Freisetzung aus Vesikeln ist der Haupt Signalweg von anregenden Synapsen im Sauger und somit wichtig fur die neuronale Aktivitat. GABA ist der bedeutendste hemmende Neurotransmitter, bindet auf Rezeptoren der Postsynapse und leitet hemmendes Signal ein.\r\nDoch gibt es Unterschiede in den verschiedenen Synapsen-Typen? Und welche sind in Krankheit eher betroffen? Um diese Fragen zu beantworten, erregende und hemmende Synapsen wurden evaluiert um mittels typischen synaptischen Markern spezifisch markiert: GABAR- α2 fur die hemmenden Synapsen und PSD-95 (DLG4) fur die Postsynapse der erregenden Synapsen. Antikorper auf menschlichem Paraffin fixierten Schnitten von 15 verschiedenen Hirnregionen, in Alzheimer, Kontrolle und Lewy-Korper-Demenz, wurden mittels Konfokal Mikroskop (Zeiss LSM 780) detektiert und mit Hilfe von IgorPro7 einzelne Synapsen ausgewertet.\r\nDer starkste Synapsen Verlust war in den hemmenden Synapsen des Entorhinal Kortex von Alzheimer Patienten zu verzeichnen.

      "title": "Concussion in Sport",
      "abstract": "Concussions affect millions of athletes of all ages each year in a variety of sports. Athletes in certain sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and combative sports like boxing are at higher risk for concussion. Direct or indirect mechanical forces acting on the skull and brain cause a concussion, which is a milder form of brain injury. Conventional neuroimaging (e.g., computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for concussion is typically negative. Concussions involve both neurometabolic and subtle structural damage to the brain that results in signs (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, confusion), symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, nausea), and functional impairment (e.g., cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor). Symptoms, impairment, and recovery time following concussion can last from a few days to weeks or months, based on a variety of risk factors, including younger age, female sex, history of concussion, and history of migraine. Following a concussion, athletes may experience one or more clinical profiles, including cognitive fatigue, vestibular, oculomotor, post-traumatic migraine (PTM), mood/anxiety, and/or cervical. The heterogeneous nature of concussion warrants a comprehensive approach to assessment, including a thorough clinical examination and interview; symptom inventories; and cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor, and exertion-based evaluations. Targeted treatment and rehabilitation strategies including behavior management, vestibular, vision, and exertion therapies, and in some cases medication can be effective in treating the various concussion clinical profiles. Some athletes experience persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and/or psychological issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) following concussion. Following appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies, determination of safe return to play is predicated on being symptom-free and back to normal levels of function at rest and following exertion. Certain populations, including youth athletes, may be at a higher risk for worse impairment and prolonged recovery following concussion. It has been suggested that some athletes experience long-term effects associated with concussion including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, additional empirical studies on the role of concussion on CTE are needed, as CTE may have multiple causes that are unrelated to sport participation and concussion.",

      "title": "Procrastination, Perfectionism, and Other Work-Related Mental Problems: Prevalence, Types, Assessment, and Treatment—A Scoping Review",
      "abstract": "Work-related mental problems can be defined as behaviors, emotions and cognitions that impede the successful completion of a task in a given time frame, i. e., the difficulty or inability to achieve important work-related goals. They are highly prevalent but have been neglected in psychology in general and as a target of psychotherapy in particular. Although work-related problems do not represent a mental disorder per se , they are associated with severe distress and high psychosocial costs. In this article, the prevalence of work-related problems, associated burden, diagnostic assessment and treatment are reviewed. So far, research has primarily focused on procrastination, i.e., the act of postponing or delaying tasks until the last minute or past the deadline. However, procrastination represents just one type of work-related problems among several others. Further forms of work-related problems are presented (e.g., perfectionism, or work-related problems in the context of specific personality types). The relation of work-related problems to specific mental disorders is discussed. Psychosocial interventions are the treatment of choice for work-related mental problems. However, response rates for the treatment of procrastination are limited, which calls for further research into which treatments work for whom. No evidence-based treatments are currently available for other types of work-related problems, with the exception of perfectionism, a personality trait that is also linked to problems in the field of work. Thus, there is a need to further improve the treatment of work-related problems including procrastination. For other types of work-related problems, effective treatments need to be developed and validated. They may be based on existing manualized treatments and extended by specific aspects or modules focusing on work-related problems.",

      "title": "Genetics of Suicidal Behavior",
      "abstract": "Suicidal behavior is a global public health problem. Patients with different psychiatric disorders, such as alcohol and substance use disorders, depression, bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), personality disorders and altered behaviours frequently have suicidal thoughts, ideas and frequently develop suicidal behavior. However, there are a lot of psychiatric patients who do not have suicidal thoughts or suicidal ideation, who do not display suicidal behavior, and who never attempt suicide. Suicide is believed to be a multi-determined act, precipitated by a complex interplay of different socio-cultural factors, biological factors, traumatic events, a history of psychiatric disorders and particular personality traits. Neurobiological basis of suicidal behavior is not completely understood, however, the disturbances in the function of the major neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter systems, such as the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, serotonin, noradrenalin, dopamine, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), glutamate, endogenous opioids, and plasma cholesterol status, are assumed to be responsible for the development of suicidal behavior. The evidence from the literature suggests that genetic factors play an important role in the predisposition to suicidal behavior. Therefore, the data from the family, twin, and adoption studies all point to a genetic predisposition to suicide and suicidal behavior. Genetic studies are focused on the search for the candidate genes related to suicide and suicidal behavior. The most frequently investigated genes are the genes related to serotonin, noradrenalin and dopamine transporters, receptors and enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of these neurotransmitters, genes related to glutamatergic system, GABA and to neurotrophic factors and genes related to neuroendocrine system. However, despite the numerous studies showing the association of particular genes and suicidal behavior, the genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior, such as susceptibility genes that contribute to suicidal behavior, are still not yet confirmed, and there are a lot of non-replication in these results. Since the transmission patterns of suicidal behavior is complex, involving both environmental and genetic factors, precipitated by the complex interactions of the multiple genes, multiple alleles are implicated in the development of suicidal behavior. Therefore, more studies are needed to fully understand the genetic basis of suicidal behavior. The search for the genetic risk factors of suicidal behavior is an important task in the studies of the genetic susceptibility to suicide, since these studies might help in identifying subjects prone to develop suicidal behavior, who might attempt and/or complete suicide. These subjects might be properly treated and suicidal behavior might be prevented, in order to decrease the suicide rate. Therefore, an important goal in psychiatry is to evaluate the risk factors of suicidal behavior, in order to prevent suicidal behavior, to early identify the individuals prone to attempt suicide, to use the best possible treatment strategies to save lifes and to prevent suicidal attempts and suicide.",

      "title": "Lost in Translation – What is Alexithymia",
      "abstract": "Introduction Alexithymia is considered a personality trait characterized by difficulties in identifying and expressing emotions, impoverished fantasy life and tendency toward action-oriented or ‘operational’ Thinking. There are alterations in cognitive processing and regulation of emotions, and tendency to somatization. Objectives The authors examine literature regarding the concept of alexithymia, exploring the current definition and role in the clinic, research findings and proposed management. Methods A brief non-systematized review is presented, using the literature available on PubMed and Google Scholar. Results Alexithymia is not a discrete psychiatric diagnosis. It has been reported in 9-10% of the general population. It is related to numerous psychiatric disorders (substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, depression and eating disorders), but also to somatic illnesses (essential hypertension, functional gastrointestinal disorders, diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, fibromyalgia and cancer pain). Neuroimaging and neurobiological studies found evidence for morphological and functional brain alterations that integrate the classification introduced by Bermond. Affective type I is characterized by the absence of emotional experience and, consequently, by the absence of cognition accompanying the emotion (associated to right unilateral cortical lesions). Cognitive Type II is characterized by a selective deficit of emotional cognition with sparing of emotional experience (associated to a right-to-left unidirectional deficit in interhemispheric transfer). Conclusions There is little consensus on the subject. Clarification of the mechanisms underlying alexithymia can improve our management of these individuals. Identification of effective strategies could improve the patients’ capacities for adaptive emotional processing and enhance other aspects of functioning. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Basic Epidemiology of Stroke and Risk Assessment",
      "abstract": "Definition of stroke In epidemiological studies, stroke is defined by clinical findings and symptoms [1]: rapidly developed signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours (unless interrupted by surgery or death), with no apparent cause other than a vascular origin. This approach is supplemented with neuroimaging but even with advanced imaging techniques the diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Therefore, precise definitions of clinical signs are needed. WHO definitions are [1]: Definite focal signs: unilateral or bilateral motor impairment (including dyscoordination) unilateral or bilateral sensory impairment aphasis/dysphasis (non-fluent speech) hemianopia (half-sided impairment of visual fields) diplopia forced gaze (conjugate deviation) dysphagia of acute onset apraxia of acute onset ataxia of acute onset perception deficit of acute onset. Not acceptable as sole evidence of focal dysfunction: dizziness, vertigo localized headache blurred vision of both eyes dysarthria (slurred speech) impaired cognitive function (including confusion) impaired consciousness seizures. (Although strokes can present in this way, these signs are not specific and cannot therefore be accepted as definite evidence of stroke.) Neuroimaging studies are needed for classification of stroke by subtypes: subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain infarction (necrosis). Although there may be large variations in stroke subtype distributions between populations, thrombotic and embolic strokes are responsible for about 80–85% of all strokes in the Indo-European populations, and as low as 65% in some Asian populations. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represents 5–10% of all strokes, and occurs more often in younger subjects, while both intracerebral and especially thrombotic and embolic stroke increase markedly with age.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dissociative psychopathology is understood as an immature defence mechanism of personality, based on the techniques of reality distortion. The natural cause of a disorder reflects the lack of sense of coherence between identity, memory, awareness, perception and consequently - goal orientated action. Its symptoms manifest the separation of emotions, thoughts and behaviours bound with an event in order to maintain an illusory sense of control of demanding and unbearable experience. We describe the case of a 57-year-old woman suffering from broad range of dissociative symptoms from early childhood. Decomposition of integrity between memories, a sense of self-identity and control of the body has become the cause of numerous suicide attempts, multiple psychiatric hospitalizations and not fully effective therapy attempts. Destructive influence of psychopathological symptoms negatively influenced patient’s life course, decisions made as well as family, work and social life.",

      "title": "The Problem of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Functional&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder is an entity that is commonly referred to by names such as psychogenic or conversion disorder [1]. It is defined as a neurological disorder caused by psychological factors, falling into the category of somatic symptom disorders in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Some well-known examples of somatic symptom disorders involving other organ systems include irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and chronic pelvic pain [2].\r\n\r\nPatients with functional disorders are seen in various clinical settings and are commonly admitted as an inpatient for further work-up and symptom management [3]. Those with neurological symptoms in particular may receive work-up beyond the scope of being thorough, as their symptoms can be concerning for neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. Physicians may ultimately become convinced that these patients’ symptoms are due to a psychological cause, but convincing these patients may not be easy, as the suffering is real but the treatment is not instantaneous.\r\n\r\nAs a movement disorders clinical fellow, I often see patients with functional movement disorders. Functional movement disorders can present in various ways such as tremor, myoclonus, or dystonia, but share common clinical features on examination such as variability, distractibility and entrainibility of the movements [4]. Although the term psychogenic is considered to be less ambiguous than functional, its negative nuance may add to the patients’ struggle to accept the diagnosis. Some common reactions are: “Are you saying it is all in my head?” “I find it hard to believe that what I am experiencing is just from stress.” “…but I don’t feel stressed.”\r\n\r\nThrough my fellowship, I have tried different ways of delivering the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder. My strategy has evolved with experience, a mix of successful and unsuccessful situations. For example, the patient might seem to be initially receptive of the diagnosis and considering the recommended treatment options with a positive attitude. When this appeared to be the case, I would feel not only relieved, but also a sense of triumph-I had successfully dealt with a challenging situation, and now surely the patient would be on the road to recovery! I quickly realized that this was not always the case. In the following days, I would receive emails doubting or misinterpreting the diagnosis that seemed to be clear at the time. Some patients seemed unhappy, if not angry or disappointed. I would often review the approach that I had used to deliver the diagnosis on the day of the visit, and try to revise my strategy accordingly, hoping to be more successful the next time.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons may underlie this difficulty of accepting the diagnosis of a functional disorder. Currently, the knowledge on the physiology of the disorder is limited, and we cannot satisfactorily explain to these patients exactly how this occurs, which may add to the patient’s skepticism towards the diagnosis. The variability of symptoms, a common feature of the disorder itself, may confuse and deceive the patients, leaving them to wonder what rare organic neurological disorder they might have as the cause. Last but not least, patients may be influenced by the stigma of having any disorder that has relation to psychological factors, and even misinterpret the diagnosis as malingering, an intentional production of symptoms.\r\n\r\nBut do we physicians also have difficulty embracing the diagnosis of a functional disorder? Some patients are seen by several physicians and undergo extensive testing until seen by someone who might finally share the diagnosis. It is not unusual that this can be years later since the beginning of symptoms. Delivering the diagnosis is certainly challenging for reasons mentioned above, and physicians fear missing an organic neurological disorder. However, simply labeling these patients as having ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ not only leads to increased healthcare cost [5], but can result in increased morbidity and mortality from unnecessary diagnostic workup or treatment.\r\n\r\n“How can you tell me it’s functional when I am not functional?” The words of a patient echo through my head as I share this diagnosis with yet another patient. I only hope to be able to help my patients so that they understand that the diagnosis was achieved through identifying positive signs and symptoms, and that it is not merely a diagnosis of exclusion. I try to reassure them that this disorder is very much real, involuntary and acknowledge that it can be very disabling. Some patients have accepted the diagnosis and made a substantial recovery through cognitive behavioral therapy. Hopefully, with more knowledge on the physiology, increased awareness of the disorder in both patients and the medical community and better strategies of sharing the diagnosis functional can one day become truly functional.",

Avoidance can also feature prominently. In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction.

      "title": "DIAGNOSIS OF FIBROMYALGIA IN HEALTH PRACTICE",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic non inﬂammatory, non-autoimmune central aﬀerent processing disorder leading to a diﬀuse pain syndrome. It aﬀects individuals of diﬀerent age groups, sex and sociocultural background. It is estimated to aﬀect 2-5% of western population. The symptoms include widespread pain, fatigue, stiﬀness and sleep disturbance, cognitive problems and mood disorders (anxiety, depression or both) 1. The etiology of Fibromyalgia (FM) is unknown; however several factors may contribute to development as well as severity of symptoms of FM. Genetic polymorphisms have been reported in serotonin transporter and receptors, as well as in dopamine, beta2 adrenergic and glutamate receptor genes. 2 Middle aged women and young are more aﬀected. Sleep abnormalities, autonomic dysregulation, and psychological variables like perfectionist personality, negative beliefs, low self-esteem, depression and anxiety are the contributory factors.3 Physical examination and pathological investigations reveal no evidence of articular, osseous or soft tissue inﬂammation or degeneration. Patients may have tender points both above and below the waist. The previously followed criteria, depending on presence of tender points, are no more followed. In 2010, a new diagnostic criterion was adopted by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 4. It has three points: - 1. Widespread pain index (WPI)&gt;7 &amp; a symptom severity (SS) score &gt;5 or widespread pain index 3-6 &amp; (SS) score &gt;9. 2. Symptoms present for at least 3.No other disorder to explain In diﬀerential diagnosis, many diseases need to be ruled out making the diagnosis of FM. These are systemic lupus erythematosis, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteomalacia, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic hypothyroidism, chronic hepatitis, HIV, hemo- chromatosis, celiac disease, myasthenia gravis, hyperthyroidism, myopathies, Sjogren`s, adrenal insufficiency, lymphoma and chronic fatigue syndrome.5 Although the exact pathophysiology of FM is unknown, most of the researchers believe that the pathophysiology of FM is due to the central sensitization within the CNS, manifesting as amplified pain perception. The specific abnormalities that have been observed in the aﬀerent pain procession areas of the CNS in FM patients, who exhibit the following symptoms: increased excitability of dorsal horn nuclei due to abnormal windup; increased levels of substance P, nerve growth factor, glutamate and aspartate measured in CSF of patients with FM 6expanded receptive fields for central pain perception (central sensitization); MRI shows expanded fields in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex and somatosensory area.7 The abnormalities within the descending analgesia system are also observed i.e decreased levels of pain inhibitory neurotransmitters including nor epinephrine, serotonin, dopamine and suppression of normal activity of dopamine releasing neurons in limbic system.1 The management of FM is very challenging. It has many components i.e patient education, physical exercises, analgesia, treatment of associated condition like anxiety, depression, and mood disorders. Counseling about the disease and CBT are also helpful. Medication approved for the treatment of FM are: Serotonin-noreprenphine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); Duloxetine ,venlaxafine, Milnacipran. Anticonvulsants; Pregabalin. Tri cyclic antidepressants: Amitriptyline, imipramine. Analgesia; Tramadol. Paracetamol and NSAIDS are not aﬀective for analgesia.8,9 The diagnosis of FM is quiet challenging in the developed world with good evaluation and referral system. In underdeveloped country with poor medical education and no referral system FM patients are the mostly go un-diagnosed and hence are under treated. It is high time to highlight the importance of diagnosis of FM by the general practitioner and other specialties doctors for proper management of these patients. The disease impact of FM is not less than any other chronic inﬂammatory disease like Rheumatoid Arthritis. On an average the FM patients visit doctor 3-4 times more often than the general population (17 versus 4 visits/year). The frequent visits of patients with FM, is one of the factors of increasing burden on health system as well as having socio-economic impact on patients.",

      "abstract": "Horses compete routinely in endurance-type activities. Many of the various pathophysiological mechanisms which arise during endurance exercise have implications for the health and function of the neurological system. The development of centrally-mediated fatigue is a normal homeostatic physiological event with several possible mechanisms. Development of pathophysiological phenomena such as cerebral oedema may be near-terminal events during or after endurance exhaustion. Cellular damage resulting in cytotoxic cerebral oedema may result from decreases in circulating blood volume (dehydration), blood pressure, oxygen, and glucose, or increases in brain temperature. Vasogenic cerebral oedema arises from changes in cerebral vascular perfusion, tone, and permeability. Increased vascular permeability results from increased brain temperature, poor vascular integrity due to severe dehydration, disseminated intravascular coagulation due to hemoconcentration or endotoxemia, and iatrogenic overhydration during therapy. Clinical signs of intracranial disease after endurance exercise include staggering, shaking, ataxia, paresis, poor tongue tone, facial twitching, collapse, recumbency, seizures, and death. Treatment should include active and aggressive cooling, intravenous polyionic fluids, acid-base imbalance correction, intravenous glucose and calcium supplementation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents once the patient is better hydrated, intra-nasal oxygen therapy if practicable, and achievement of a non-dependent head posture to prevent jugular venous hypertension and further increases in intracranial pressure. The prognosis for central fatigue is good with appropriate supportive care, but the prognosis for successful treatment of cerebral oedema must be considered guarded at best. Prevention is critical and must be through incorporation of mandatory rest stops with sufficient length and veterinary monitoring to allow prevention and detection of exhaustion, excessive dehydration, and neurological signs. Management flexibility in shortening or postponing rides in hot and humid conditions, mandated use of aggressive cooling techniques, and more restrictive entry criteria for upper level Fédération Equestre Internationale races should all be considered as viable options for optimising the safety of endurance horses.",

      "title": "Memory loss during lenalidomide treatment: a report on two cases",
      "abstract": "There are many reports of cognitive dysfunction in patients receiving chemotherapy or targeted therapies. Many antineoplastic agents may be involved in the condition also known as \"chemo brain\" or \"chemo fog\". Two male patients (aged 41 and 70) with multiple myeloma developed severe, rapidly progressing cognitive impairment (mostly involving episodic memory) and loss of independence in activities of daily living during lenalidomide-based treatment. On withdrawal of the drug, one patient recovered normal cognitive function and independence in activities of daily living, whereas mild cognitive impairment persisted in the other patient. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score was 6 out of 13 for the first patient and 5 out of 13 for the second, suggesting a probable causal relationship between the adverse event and lenalidomide administration. Lenalidomide may induce particular cognitive disorders (notably episodic memory impairments) in some patients. The drug's putative neurotoxicity is probably promoted by specific risk factors (such as previous chemotherapy, prior mild cognitive impairment, age and the presence of cerebrovascular lesions).",

      "abstract": "Local and regional anesthesia, in discrepancy to systemic, general anesthesia, involves the reversible deadening of a specific region of the body to help any sensation of pain. Pain may be blocked on different situations of its signal transduction pathway,e.g., at the point of origin, along the jitters, or in the brain. Consequently, local and regional anesthesia can be divided into local topical and infiltration anesthesia, regional supplemental whim-whams blocks( PNB), and neuraxial anesthesia(e.g., spinal and epidural). Local anesthesia can be combined with general anesthesia, allowing the boluses of anesthetic and analgesic medicines to be reduced during surgery, and may exclude the need for other measures to achieve sufficient anesthesia( depending on the timeframe of surgery, threat profile, case's concurrence). In general, local anesthesia carries lower threat than general anesthesia, as essential body functions(e.g., respiration) aren't affected.",

It was found that patients with paranoid schizophrenia with mild acute drug-induced akathisia have more pronounced general psychopathological symptoms, such as anxiety, tension, depression, refusal to cooperate, weakening of impulsivity control, and congestion of mental experiences. According to the assessment of the risk profile of aggression, additional symptoms are more pronounced, such as anger, difficulties in delaying gratification (delayed reward), and affective lability.

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

The hyper-arousal theory of insomnia postulates that sleep disturbances are caused by an increase in physiological arousal based on the discovery of high physiological arousal, which may be connected to these people's active stress system. Sometimes, sleep issues including difficulties getting asleep, difficulty remaining asleep, or having poor-quality sleep are referred to as insomnia. Insomnia can be brought on by a variety of things, including the use of psychoactive drugs, caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, and cocaine; hormonal changes, such as menstruation and menopause; stressful life events, like the birth of a child and bereavement; disruptions of the circadian rhythm, like shift work and jet lag; some neurological disorders; and medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis. Everything in the universe vibrates at a specific frequency, and when we are in a state of natural resonance, we are in perfect health. But if a bodily component begins to vibrate at the incorrect frequency, the energy becomes trapped, and illness appears. In order to release the repressed energy and return resonance to its natural level, chanting can therefore be employed to affect a therapy.",

Although the association between specific clinical symptomatology and lesion location is one of the fundamental goals of clinical practice in neurology, this has rarely been the case with psychiatric disorders. Cognitive functions such as visual spatial reasoning, auditory comprehension, speech production, and extent and severity of motor or sensory impairment are all symptoms of stroke which are commonly used by clinicians to localize lesions to particular brain regions. There is, however, no known neuropathology consistently associated with primary mood disorders (i.e., mood disorders not associated with a physical illness), and, even among secondary mood disorders (i.e., mood disorders associated with a physical illness) the idea that there maybe a focal neuropathology associated with the development of major depression has led to both surprise and skepticism.",

It has a protective role because it protects the body from damage and helps to maintain organ function, the organism as a whole. Pain is one of the world's health problems, the most common causes of pain are injury, surgery, malignancy, and hormonal disorders. Delineation of pain is to: physical, mental and physical psychogenic caused. Physical pain is a symptom for which patients most often asked for medical help, the pain is a warning mechanism to inform that there is a tissue injury or dysfunction of individual organs. Mental pain and suffering often called. It is a state of deep sadness often associated with fear, anxiety and other negative emotions that occur after someone, for the individual, irreparable and significant loss. The relationship between pain and injury is not simple, that is possible: injury without pain, without injury, pain disproportionate to the severity of injury, pain after healing of injuries. Injuries without pain - some people are born without sensitivity to pain. This very rare genetic disorder is known as analgesia. Pain without injury - common in so-called. psychogenic pain where the pain occurs after mental tension and where there are no organic damage. Pain disproportionate the difficulty of injury- may occur in insignificant physical processes that do not have great physical significance for the total health of the individual, and cause very severe pain. The pain after healing injury - very common after injuring nerves and known examples of such pain are phantom pain and causalgia. Causalgia is very severe pain, burning type that occurs because of injury of damage causing their peripheral sensory nerves. Phantom pain is common in people who are missing the lower part of the body (leg, hand, and breast). Patients feel pain in a body part that they amputated therefore no longer exists, and so clearly perceived the pain that they feel that the body is still there. In addition to causing health, physical and mental difficulties, pain significantly affects the economic situation of the individual and society at large, so big attention should be paid to its prevention and cure. The doctor's obligation is to disclose the cause of pain and mitigate / eliminate pain. Access to treatment of chronic pain, sometimes acute, is multidisciplinary and should be administered pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments (physical therapy, TENS, ultrasound, laser, exercise, heat and cold), and sometimes pain treatment methods (acupuncture, chiropractic and other) . While there has been great progress in the treatment of chronic pain, many patients are still suffering because of poor pain assessment and treatment.",

      "abstract": "As effects of excitement may be noted—( a ) those which are transitory, occurring during the excitement, and (b) those which persist. As transitory effects there may be an apparently general hypermnesia, in which there is a marked freshening of all memories, or there may be a selective hypermnesia, where certain rather narrow lines of association are followed. The lasting effects may be hypermnesia, hypomnesia, or total amnesia for events experienced during the excitement. The following lasting effects may also be noted upon experiences that have occurred before the emotion: (1) The well-known retro-active amnesia; (2) The opposite, retro-active hypermnesia to which little attention has formerly been paid; (3) a combination of both these effects; for the same person the stretch preceding the critical event may show vivid recollections followed by a period of utter blank. The retro-active hypermnesia in the author's cases rarely goes beyond the events of the day preceding the excitement. It occurred in 25 out of 225 cases. The antecedent events are unusually vivid—more vivid than any other of the patients' memories. The vividness is not confined to visual images, although these are more frequent; sounds, the mood, the general state of the mind may be clearly represented. There is some indication that women experience it more frequently than men. In some cases the effect has come at some crisis at early childhood, in others at a later date. The quality of the emotion seems of less importance than the intensity of the shock. Fear, or fearless surprise, or pleasurable surprise may be the cause. If the intensity be exceeded the experiences connected with it are in some degree suppressed; while if it be not reached the experiences are lost probably by a mere failure to gather up the events into the mesh of interest. Emotion facilitates the recall of whatever is noticed during the excitement, and it seems probable that memory images may be treated by the emotional onrush in the same way as perceptive images. The experiences of the preceding day, however, probably do not exist as actual images at the time of the emotion but as psycho-physical dispositions or traces, so that where there is retro-active hypermnesia the emotion would seem to have the power to strengthen these dispositions and the connections by which they may be called into life. The author gives illustrative cases.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

La douleur non exprimée ne joue plus son rôle d’alerte à la menace vitale et contribue à l’augmentation de la mortalité liée à des pathologies somatiques dans ces populations dites vulnérables, notamment chez les adultes avec TSA [1,4], chez qui la prescription de psychotropes compliquent les mesures d’hétéro-évaluations classiques. Certaines études expérimentales ont montrés que ces groupes de patients présentent des particularités nociceptives avec des seuils à la nociception augmentés ou des réactions paradoxales, mais les résultats sont contradictoires [2]. Les causes de ces phénomènes sont mal comprises. Une atteinte des structures cérébrales impliquées dans l’intégration émotionnelle de la douleur (cortex préfrontal), une augmentation de l’activité opiacée, une dissociation paradoxale entre la réponse comportementale et les réactions neurovégétatives, des possibles anomalies des mécanismes excitateurs responsables de la sommation temporelle, ont contrebalancé les hypothèses plus psychopathologiques de troubles de l’expression de la douleur dans cette condition pathologiques développementales [1,3]. En effet, au-delà de l’atteinte des processus cognitifs, les troubles de la communication chez les personnes avec TSA sont à ce jour considérés comme la principale cible des interventions à mener dans les cadres psycho-éducatifs et thérapeutiques afin de mieux prévenir et dépister la douleur chez ces patients hautement vulnérables. Car si communiquer diminue la douleur, la douleur diminue, elle les capacités de communication déjà altérées dans ces troubles, d’où l’enjeu essentiel des stratégies d’aides à la communication ou communication augmentée, qui ne peuvent plus être considérées en 2014 comme un « si besoin… ».",

Cet etat est une caracteristique commune a l'exposition a l'altitude et au syndrome d'apnees obstructives du sommeil (SAOS), bien que celle-ci soit continue dans le premier cas et intermittente et nocturne dans le second.L'hypoxie d'altitude entraine une alteration des performances cognitives et motrices. La reduction de la performance a l'exercice en altitude a longtemps ete attribuee a une alteration du metabolisme musculaire du fait d'une reduction de l'apport en oxygene. Les perturbations cerebrales induites par l'hypoxie pourraient egalement avoir un role majeur dans cette limitation.Le SAOS, veritable enjeu de sante publique, est associe a des troubles cognitifs pouvant ainsi influencer le fonctionnement quotidien des patients souffrant de ce syndrome et resulter en une somnolence diurne excessive, une baisse de la qualite de vie ou encore une reduction de la productivite au travail et des performances scolaires. Le fait que ces alterations cerebrales puissent influencer les capacites motrices et a l'effort des patients atteints d’apnees obstructives du sommeil reste en revanche a investiguer.Au cours de ce travail de these, nous nous sommes interesses a deux modeles d’exposition hypoxique et a leurs consequences cerebrales et neuromusculaires. Nous avons tout d’abord etudie l'effet d'une exposition a l'hypoxie d'altitude aigue (quelques heures) et prolongee (plusieurs jours) sur la fonction neuromusculaire et ses repercussions a l'exercice chez le sujet sain. Nous avons ensuite etudie l'influence du modele d'hypoxie intermittente associe au SAOS sur la fonction neuromusculaire et la tolerance a l'exercice de ces patients. Nous avons ainsi cherche a caracteriser les alterations cerebrales a l'exercice en lien avec ce syndrome et leur reversibilite suite a un traitement en ventilation par pression positive continue.Chez le sujet sain, nous avons demontre que la performance a l'exercice impliquant une masse musculaire reduite (flechisseurs du coude) n'etait pas limitee par une fatigue centrale accrue apres 1 et 5 jours d'exposition a une altitude de 4350 m. Nous avons mis en evidence que la dysfonction musculaire (force et endurance reduites) observee chez le patient SAOS est associee a un deficit d'activation supraspinal et une augmentation de l'inhibition intracorticale. De plus, nos resultats suggerent qu'une alteration de la reponse cerebrovasculaire a l'exercice puissent impacter negativement la tolerance a l'exercice des patients souffrant d'un SAOS severe. Ces alterations neuromusculaires et cerebrovasculaires n'etaient pas corrigees apres un traitement de huit semaines par ventilation nocturne en pression positive continue soulignant la nature persistante de ces alterations cerebrales.",

      "abstract": "Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA) are part of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC) group of headache disorders. Attacks present with repeated, severe, sharp, stabbing, or throbbing pain. Patients may experience a single attack, recurrent attacks with pain-free interictal periods, or a sawtooth pattern background pain with superimposed stabs.1,2 Although SUNCT typically presents as a primary headache disorder, it may be secondary to an underlying pathology, such as pituitary tumors or posterior fossa lesions, both intra and extra-axial (vascular lesion, tumor, or bony abnormalities). Multiple Myeloma (MM) with central nervous system involvement (CNS MM) most commonly presents with visual changes (36%), radiculopathy (27%), headache (25%), confusion (21%), dizziness (7%) and seizures (6%).3,4 Secondary SUNCT cases have been sparsely described (less than 60), and CNS MM presenting as SUNCT has not been previously described in the literature.2,5 Our case describes a previously unreported clinical presentation of CNS MM. The report highlights the need for a timely and thorough diagnostic work-up of headache in patients with risk factors for a secondary etiology, which in this case included new-onset, autonomic features, older age, and history of malignancy. A misdiagnosis will preclude a potentially life-extending or saving targeted therapy for the underlying illness. We also aim to remind practitioners of the variability in the clinical symptoms of SUNCT, which are known to occur in a significant number of cases, including migrainous features and dull interictal pain.",

Many case histories are lacking in clear description of historical facts, conduct disorders, stream of speech, etc. 3. Undiagnosed cases should be followed up most carefully. The average hurried and perfunctory note is only a little better than no note at all. 4. Conclusions without a statement of facts are misleading. Terms such as rambling, confused and violent should be used very cautiously in the primary case record. 5. Undiagnosed cases should be represented as often as new facts discovered will warrant. 6. In a considerable percentage of undiagnosed cases, disagreement and hesitation upon the part of the staff indicate, though oftentimes unwittingly, a good prognosis. 7. Confusion and apprehension in an acute psychosis would seem to indicate dementia præcox more often than any other disorder. 8. The absence of definite hallucinosis in a case otherwise doubtful contributes to failure in classification. 9. There are depressions of psychogenic origin that are not manic-depressive in nature and these types often occur between the ages of 40 and 60 with recovery. 10. The senile-presenile state is uncertain ground. A return should be made to the Kraepelinian presenile grouping. 11. Psychiatry is so far from being an exact science that many cases must be left undiagnosed if the psychiatrist is to retain his self-respect. He can not honestly diagnose them all.",

Using correlational studies and structural analyses, evidence is provided that unusual sleep experiences, dissociation, and schizotypy belong to a common domain. It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue). The paper also outlines the methodological limitations of the existing evidence and makes suggestions for future research. Finally, three models for the overlap of daytime and nighttime symptoms are reviewed, including biological abnormalities, trauma, and personality traits. Although further research is needed, it is suggested that daytime and nighttime symptoms result from problems with sleep-wake state boundaries, which may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition, association between daytime and nighttime symptoms can be attributed to the higher order personality trait of Oddity.",

We aimed to review the prevalence, natural course, potential predisposing factors (physiological, psychocognitive, and organic), and pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments of poststroke fatigue. Using PubMed CINAHL and PsycINFO, we reviewed all the available literature on poststroke fatigue and related issues. The prevalence of poststroke fatigue ranges from 23% to 75%, depending on the definition of fatigue and the characteristics of the patients included. Post-stroke fatigue seems to be of complex etiology. Predisposing factors were physiological ones including functional disability, prestroke fatigue, medical comorbidities, medication, sleep disturbances, and nutritional problems; psychocognitive ones including depression and cognitive dysfunction; and organic ones including damage to particular brain areas with consequent neurochemical alterations, perfusion deficit, and neuroinflammation. Poststroke fatigue is a persistent and debilitating symptom in some patients, and can have adverse affects on patient's neurological recovery, quality of life, and mortality. Few therapeutic trials have been reported, and the therapy was rarely successful, possibly because of the complex nature of poststroke fatigue. Poststroke fatigue is a common and frequently disabling problem of complex etiology. Further studies are urgently needed to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of post-stroke fatigue and to develop better treatments for this condition.",

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have \"soft\" signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

      "abstract": "Introducao: A distonia e uma sindrome de contracoes musculares sustentadas involuntarias que produzem sempre movimentos repetitivos e contorcidos ou posturas anormais. Dentre todos os disturbios do movimento associados a disfuncao dos nucleos da base, a distonia e a menos compreendida em relacao a sua fisiopatologia. Recentestrabalhos revelaram que o circuito motor nucleos da base cortico-estriado-talamocortical apresenta um importante papel nas funcoes cognitivas nao-motoras, particularmente na discriminacao temporal e espacial e na integracao multisensorial. O limiar de discriminacao espacial foi encontrado anormal em pacientes com distonia focal nas maos, distonia cervical e blefaroespasmo. Um fenomeno distinto em distonia e o truque sensorial (ou geste antagonistique). Os truques sensoriais sao geralmentemanobras tateis ou de outra natureza sensorial envolvendo o lado afetado ou nao, que reduzem os movimentos e posturas distonicas. O espasmo hemifacial e uma doenca neurologica com caracteristicas fenomenologicas semelhantes a distonia, porem o espasmo hemifacial e uma forma de mioclonia de origem periferica com contracoesmusculares involuntarias e unilateriais clonicas e tonicas dos musculos inervados pelo nervo facial ipsilateral. Objetivo: verificar a frequencia e a caracterizacao clinica dos truques sensoriais em diferentes tipos de distonia e no espasmo hemifacial, bem como determinar mudancas na sensibilidade espacial durante a realizacao do Grating Orientation Task e correlaciona-las com os truques sensoriais. Amostra e metodos: Osvoluntarios foram recrutados da Clinica Disturbios do Movimento - Ambulatorio Bias Fortes UFMG. Participaram da pesquisa individuos de ambos os sexos, diagnosticados com distonia (exceto a distonia heredo-degenerativa) do tipo blefaroespasmo (n=20), distonia cervical (21) e caibra do escrivao (10) ou espasmo hemifacial (26). Osvoluntarios foram avaliados por uma estudante de mestrado que aplicou um questionario e o Mini Exame do Estado Mental, bem como avaliou a sensibilidade espacial atraves do Grating Orientation Task. Resultados: A presenca do truque sensorial foi maior na distonia cervical (81%) quando comparada ao grupo espasmo hemifacial (38,5%) p= 0,004 e ao grupo câimbra do escrivao (20%), p= 0,001. A sensibilidade espacial da mao dominante dos sujeitos que apresentam o truque sensorial foi significativamente maior que daqueles sujeitos que nao apresentam otruque sensorial (p=0,019;p<0,050). Conclusoes: Mais de 1/3 dos pacientes com espasmo hemifacial apresentaram truque sensorial. Truques sao mais comuns na distonia cervical (81%) quando comparada ao grupo espasmo hemifacial (38,5%) e aogrupo caibra do escrivao (20%). Truques sensoriais sao mais comuns em pacientes com deficits de sensibilidade espacial.",

      "title": "Memory loss after stroke",
      "abstract": "Memory loss commonly occurs as a result of the loss of nerve cells in the brain. When memory loss is so severe that it interferes with normal daily functioning, it is called dementia. People with dementia may have difficulty learning new things or remembering names of people they just met. They may get lost in places that were previously very familiar or have trouble finding words. The term “mild cognitive impairment” is used for a common condition in elderly people in which the memory problem is usually mild and does not interfere with normal daily activities. Most people with mild cognitive impairment do not develop a severe memory problem or end up developing dementia. There are many things that can cause dementia. One of these is Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Another is called vascular dementia, caused by brain damage due to strokes. More information about causes of dementia can be found on the next page.\n\nIn this issue of Neurology , O’Brien and colleagues report the results of a study in elderly people evaluating the risk of developing dementia after a person has had a stroke (Gamaldo A, Moghekar A, Kilada S, Resnick SM, Zonderman AB, O’Brien R.

      "abstract": ". Istirahat dan tidur merupakan kebutuhan dasar yang dibutuhkan oleh semua\r\norang. Setiap orang memerlukan kebutuhan istirahat atau tidur yang cukup agar\r\ntubuh dapat berfungsi secara normal (Wicaksono, 2012). Tidur merupakan salah\r\nsatu fungsi biologis yang berperan penting dalam status kesehatan individu.\r\nSebagian individu mengalami masalah dengan tidurnya, dimana gangguan tidur\r\nyang sering terjadi salah satunya adalah insomnia (Putri dan Bayhakki, 2016).\r\nDi Indonesia, belum diketahui angka pastinya namun prevalensi pada orang\r\ndewasa mencapai 20% (Wicaksono, 2012). Insomnia merupakan keadaan tidak\r\ndapat tidur atau terganggunya pola tidur. Orang yang bersangkutan mungkin tidak\r\ndapat tidur, sukar untuk jatuh tidur, atau mudah terbangun dan kemudian tidak\r\ndapat tidur lagi. Insomnia umumnya merupakan kondisi sementara atau jangka\r\npendek. Dalam beberapa kasus, insomnia dapat menjadi kronis. Hal ini sering\r\ndisebut sebagai gangguan tidur yang paling sering terjadi yang berhubungan\r\ndengan situasional stres akut, seperti pekerjaan baru atau menjelang ujian.\r\nInsomnia ini biasanya hilang ketika stressor hilang atau individu telah beradaptasi\r\ndengan stressor. Namun, insomnia sementara sering berulang ketika tegangan\r\nbaru atau serupa muncul dalam kehidupan pasien (Kaplan dan Sadock, 2010).\r\nDalam TCM, insomnia yang diakibatkan sindrom hiperaktivitas Yang karena\r\ndefisiensi Yin disebabkan karena kebiasaan makan manis sehingga terjadi panas\r\npada lambung yang dapat mengganggu fungsi transformasi dan transportasi limpa.\r\nDisamping itu, insomnia juga disebabkan karena suka berpikir. Berpikir yang\r\nmelampaui batas mengakibatkan peredaran Qi terhalang dan fungsi transportasi\r\ndan transformasi Pi-limpa tidak berjalan dengan normal. Organ lambung yang\r\nekses dan organ limpa yang defisiensi (unsur tanah) tidak dapat membatasi organ\r\nginjal sehingga menyebabkan defisiensi Yin pada organ ginjal. Dengan adanya\r\ndefisiensi Yin ginjal menyebabkan Yin ginjal tidak dapat menguap ke atas untuk\r\nmembatasi Yang Qi jantung. Karena Yin ginjal tidak dapat membatasi Yang Qi\r\njantung menyebabkan terjadinya hiperaktivitas api jantung. Saat api jantung\r\nterganggu, Shen-jiwa ikut terganggu menyebabkan terjadinya insomnia.\r\nPenanganan yang dilakukan pada penderita insomnia yaitu terapi akupresur\r\ndan terapi herbal. Terapi akupresur dilakukan pada titik Neiguan (PC6), Shenmen\r\n(HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) dilakukan sebanyak 12 kali terapi yang diberikan\r\nsebanyak 3 kali dalam seminggu. Serta terapi herbal setiap hari selama 28 hari\r\ndengan menggunakan simplisia daun putri malu (Mimosa pudica) dengan dosis 10\r\ngram yang direbus dengan 750 mL air, diminum sehari 1 kali sebanyak 200 mL\r\nsebelum tidur.\r\nDari hasil setelah pemberian terapi kombinasi akupresur pada titik Neiguan\r\n(PC6), Shenmen (HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) serta pemberian herbal putri malu\r\n(Mimosa pudica) dapat memberikan hasil yang baik terhadap pasien dengan\r\nkeluhan insomnia. Pasien merasa lebih tenang, relaks, dan pasien merasa mudah\r\nmengantuk pada malam hari.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia and related psychoses is primarily characterized by positive and negative symptoms, as well as cognitive disturbances. Cognitive factors crucial in the pathogenesis of psychosis are specifically studied in terms of cognitive biases that may play a role in the formation and maintenance of psychotic symptoms. Cognitive biases refer to systematic errors in both cognitive processing and content that deviate from logical thinking. Cognitive biases can affect attention, decision-making/reasoning, memory recall, motivation or even attributional style. Psychotic-like experiences and psychotic disorders have been associated with a tendency to jump to conclusions, bias against disconfirmatory evidence and bias against confirmatory evidence as well as liberal acceptance bias. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia tend to present higher belief inflexibility in comparison to healthy individuals and are overconfident in wrong judgments. In the monitoring tasks showing they show a higher tendency to misattribute internally-generated stimuli to external sources (externalizing bias) (1). Finally, patients with schizophrenia tend to have excessive attention toward irrelevant, neutral or familiar stimuli known as the salience aberrant bias. There are several specific psychological interventions designed to ameliorate cognitive biases, such as Metacognitive Training (2,3), Thinking Well (4), Social Cognition and Interaction Training (5). These trainings have been shown to teach patients about cognitive biases and how they contribute to symptoms of psychosis and consequently how they can affect their daily life. There is an increasing number of studies showing results of these interventions in reducing cognitive biases and positive symptoms as well as improving clinical and cognitive insight.",

Being bedfast with poor caretaker relationships and being socially isolated are risk factors for psychosis among elderly persons. A thorough history is essential to differential diagnosis. Psychiatric causes to be ruled out include schizophrenia; depression, including mania; dementia and delirium; paranoid state; and late-life delusional disorder. Perhaps the most common etiology is cognitive impairment, generally attributable to Alzheimer's disease or multi-infarct dementia. Organic or toxic etiologies need to be ruled out, especially in persons with visual hallucinations. Drug toxicity, a structural brain lesion, or a subtle seizure disorder should be considered. If symptoms are not alleviated when psychosocial triggers or underlying toxic, organic, or medical causes are addressed, patients may respond to supportive therapy and low doses of high-potency neuroleptics. The clinician should keep in mind that older adults are highly sensitive to the side effects of these agents.",

      "abstract": "RESUMO: Introducao: Epilepsia e uma desordem cerebral caracterizada pela predisposicao duradoura para ocorrencia de crises epilepticas, as quais sao a expressao clinica de descargas neuronais corticais hipersincronicas. Sem fronteiras raciais, geograficas ou sociais, a epilepsia e uniformemente distribuida em todo o mundo, com predominio na populacao idosa. A caracterizacao clinica das crises e suficiente para o diagnostico, mas este pode ser refinado por exames complementares (eletroencefalograma e neuroimagem). Tais crises podem reproduzir ou bloquear todos os tipos de comportamento motores e nao motores: desde crises convulsivas tonico-clonicas generalizadas, ate piloerecao em antebraco, por exemplo. As manifestacoes atipicas dessas crises foram definidas pela semiologia clinica, quando atenderem aos seguintes criterios: nao estiverem descritas na Classificacao Internacional das Crises Epilepticas e/ou sua semiologia clinica for sugestiva de crise nao epileptica e o eletroencefalograma (EEG) comprovar que se trata de crise epileptica. O amplo espectro clinico dessas crises frequentemente promove um retardo no diagnostico, ocasionando prejuizos ao tratamento e prognostico. Destaca-se a necessidade de reconhecer as crises atipicas, a fim de diminuir o numero de pacientes subdiagnosticados e, portanto, sem o tratamento adequado. Pretende-se, por meio deste estudo, avaliar a prevalencia e a semiologia das crises epilepticas atipicas (CEA) nos pacientes diagnosticados com epilepsia. Metodologia: Estudo transversal, com 1244 pacientes atendidos no ambulatorio de epilepsia do Hospital Universitario da Universidade Federal de Alagoas (HU-UFAL), entre fevereiro de 2013 e maio de 2019. A presenca de CEA, sua semiologia ictal e sua relacao com o perfil epidemiologico dos pacientes foram analisadas. Foram incluidos os pacientes diagnosticados com epilepsia e excluidos 305 pacientes, por apresentarem um diagnostico duvidoso de epilepsia e/ou por terem comprometimento cognitivo suficiente para comprometer a clareza das informacoes prestadas. Resultados e discussao: Foi observada uma prevalencia de 5,79% de pacientes com componente atipico de crises epilepticas, dos quais 1,85% apresentaram crises exclusivamente atipicas. Neste grupo, observou-se a hegemonia do sexo feminino e de pacientes com idade acima de 50 anos, ambos com prevalencia de 60,8%. Alem disso, nos pacientes com CEA, houve um predominio evidente de crises com um componente focal, com sindrome epileptica indeterminada,  exame neurologico normal e com uma frequencia  de mais de uma crise por mes. Conclusao: As crises epilepticas atipicas descritas no trabalho caracterizam-se por manifestacoes escassamente ou nunca descritas na literatura. A nossa proposta de definicao de CEA ajudou a caracterizar esse tipo de crise e a situa-la no contexto das CE em geral. Observamos uma expressiva prevalencia de CEA nos pacientes com epilepsia. Reconhecer essas crises facilita o diagnostico precoce das epilepsias. A partir desse diagnostico, pode-se identificar as causas subjacentes, potencialmente trataveis. Desse modo, sera possivel mudar o prognostico do controle das crises e de suas causas, como tumores cerebrais, encefalites, acidentes vasculares cerebrais, disturbios metabolicos.",

      "abstract": "To review the effects of alcohol dependence on physical and mental health.Alcohol dependence is wide-spread among people of all ages and socioeconomic groups. Persons with alcohol dependence face enormous health consequences. Alcohol dependence is a major cause of mortality and is associated with psychiatric conditions, neurologic impairment, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and malignant neoplasms. Psychiatric conditions associated with alcohol dependence include major depression, dysthymia, mania, hypomania, panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, personality disorders, any drug use disorder, schizophrenia, and suicide. Psychiatric comorbidity, in turn, is associated with alcohol-related symptoms of greater severity. Excessive alcohol consumption causes brain damage, as evidenced by brain imaging, and related neurologic deficits, including impairments in working memory, cognitive processing of emotional signals, executive functions, visuospatial abilities, and gait and balance. Whereas moderate alcohol consumption is cardioprotective, heavy drinking is associated with increased risks of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and ischemic stroke, possibly due to alcohol-induced sympathetic activation. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption is a strong risk factor for various types of cancer, particularly cancers of the aero-respiratory tract, but also cancers of the digestive system, liver, breast, and ovaries. Heavy drinking is associated with various forms of alcoholic liver disease, such as cirrhosis. (People with alcohol dependence die from cirrhosis at a much higher rate than is found in the general population.) Alcohol dependence also increases the risk of injury, possibly due to alcohol-related factors such as diminished coordination and balance, increased reaction time, and impaired attention, perception, and judgment.Alcohol dependence has numerous and serious ill effects on physical and mental health and represents a major public health burden.",

The author's submission is that pathological mourning is present in all patients with AI disease, and that other events such as those mentioned are only precipitant because they uncover mourning until then kept in check by occupation and use of work as a drug. When time for reflection and loneliness allows long suppressed ambivalent feelings, guilt and bitterness to surface, remorse over 'unfinished business' increasingly dominates the patient's thoughts. Children and young people rarely have the opportunity to mourn, thus early loss is often paramount and is awakened from the unconscious years later when further losses of key figures or surrogates, including pets, occur or are anticipated. Psychotherapy involves helping patients resolve their pathological mourning.",

      "abstract": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by prolonged impairment of consciousness of variable entity, often associated with myoclonias or automatisms. EEG shows continuous paroxysmal activity or electrographic discharges. When NCSE occurs in older patients, differential diagnosis with other conditions such as stroke or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, may be difficult and a high degree of suspicion is required. Emergency EEG represents the most important means of investigation in such cases. According to ictal EEG, NCSE may be classified as generalized (including typical and “de novo” absence status) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Absence status, or ‘petit mal’ status, is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It can occur in the context of different types of generalized idiopathic epilepsies, or ‘de novo’, with onset usually in the elderly, precipitated by toxic or metabolic factors in subjects with no previous history of epilepsy [1]. Ictal EEG shows continuous or almost continuous generalized spike and polyspike and wave discharges. Clinical and EEG normalization occurs after i.v. benzodiazepines (BDZ) in most cases. The prognosis of “de novo” absence status is generally good and recurrences are rare [1]. In CPSE, impairment of consciousness may be continuous or fluctuating, but it is usually clinically very difficult to distinguish from absence status. CPSE may occur in patients with preexisting epilepsy, at times precipitated by AEDs withdrawal, or in subjects with acute or remote cerebral lesions. Ictal EEG shows continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. CPSE tends to recur and may be difficult to treat (response to i.v. BDZ in ~ 60% of patients) [2]. Cognitive and behavioral sequelae have been rarely reported, thus prompting an early recognition and treatment of such a condition. Mortality is also rare, mostly depending on etiology, but may reach up to 26,3% in the elderly. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively [3].",

      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

Intoxication, popularly accepted as an etiologic agent in some disturbances of peripheral nerves, is, with the exception of that due to lead, seldom considered at the bedside as the cause of a disease of the brain or the spinal cord. Yet toxic factors, intoxications, undoubtedly cause acute or subacute nervous disorders, which always exhibit definite histopathologic features but only occasionally possess a suggestive clinical picture. For this reason many disorders of the central nervous system remain undiagnosed and consequently improperly treated. The histopathologic features in cases of such disturbances are typical of what has been described<sup>1</sup>as multiple degenerative softening, which is a combination of parenchymatous and inflammatory changes; their clinical features may",

We argue that these traditional definitions fail to draw a clear line between altered and normal states of consciousness (NSC). We outline a new definition of ASC and argue that the proper way to understand the concept of ASC is to regard it as a representational notion: the alteration that has happened is not an alteration of consciousness (or subjective experience) per se, but an alteration in the informational or representational relationships between consciousness and the world. An altered state of consciousness is defined as a state in which the neurocognitive background mechanisms of consciousness have an increased tendency to produce misrepresentations such as hallucinations, delusions, and memory distortions. Paradigm examples of such generally misrepresentational, temporary, and reversible states are dreaming, psychotic episodes, psychedelic drug experiences, some epileptic seizures, and hypnosis in highly hypnotizable subjects. The representational definition of ASC should be applied in the theoretical and empirical studies of ASCs to unify and clarify the conceptual basis of ASC research.",

Non-convulsive seizures represent states of various levels of altered awareness, associated with electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure activity, but without outwardly observable convulsive activity2. An important feature of convulsive seizures is their potential for evolution into non-convulsive seizures, where the patient can appear “post ictal” but is having electrical seizures, without obvious convulsive activity3. Other types of status epilepticus include simple partial status (with preserved awareness), complex partial status (with impaired consciousness) and myoclonic status (often associated with coma)4.\r\n\r\nRecords from antiquity describe SE, but it has only been in the last century that there have been major advances in its understanding and treatment5. Many significant questions remain about the pathophysiology and management of this medical emergency which carries a substantial morbidity and mortality.

Her history included poor impulse control, rage attacks, multiple suicide attempts, rapid mood swings, depression, and psychotic episodes. Bulimia, panic attacks, severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and multiple somatic complaints were also present. In retrospect, these symptoms could be attributed to complex partial seizures with cognitive and affective symptomatology, automatisms, and psychosensory symptoms, and were controlled by anticonvulsant medications.

The symptoms vary widely, from immediate cardiac arrest due to high-voltage current to mild discomfort caused by low-voltage current. There are four main types of electric injuries: flash, flame, lightning, and true direct injuries. Among these true and flame electric injuries are those that involve the body and have distinct entrance and exit sites. Immediate effects on the central nervous system following a high-voltage injury may include loss of consciousness, confusion, seizures, and poor recall. However, seizures as a complication of electric brain injury are rarely reported. Central syndromes, including cerebellar syndromes, can be a result of both traumatic events and the mechanical effects of current flow, which may lead to an increased risk of morbidity. Complications related to the peripheral nervous system, cognitive impairment, and psychological effects are less commonly reported after electric injuries. In this context, we describe a rare case of electrical injury accompanied by unusual neurological complications.",

      "abstract": "Impairments in social cognition, such as inadequate perception or understanding of socially relevant information, are common and salient sequelae of many neurocognitive, neurodevelopmental, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Presence of social cognitive impairment is core to diagnosis in some conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but they can also be acquired or exacerbated through a range of other presentations, such as serious brain injury, e.g. traumatic brain injury, or through development of a psychiatric disorder, e.g. schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). Social cognitive deficits are known to disrupt interpersonal relationships, with negative consequences for the everyday life functioning and social participation of patients. Hence, effective treatments are sorely needed. This chapter provides an overview of neuropsychological rehabilitation methods, with consideration to how these relate to the remediation of social cognition. It then reviews the evidence base of social cognitive treatment interventions that target one or more processes of social cognition, e.g. emotion recognition, empathy, theory of mind, and social behaviour. A distinction is made between treatments that focus on a single aspect of social cognition versus treatments that are multifaceted. Treatments developed for patients with serious brain injury will be discussed in detail, with approaches trialed in ASD and SSD also considered.",

The stimuli are called stressors and physiological and behavioral changes in response to exposure to stressors constitute the stress response. A stress response is mediated by a complex interplay of nervous, endocrine, and immune mechanisms that involves activation of the sympathetic-adreno-medullar (SAM) axis, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and immune system. The stress response is adaptive, to begin with, that prepares the body to handle the challenges presented by an internal or external environmental challenge (stressor) e.g., the body's physiologic responses to trauma and invasive surgery serve to attenuate further tissue damage. But if the exposure to a stressor is actually or perceived as intense, repetitive (repeated acute stress), or prolonged (chronic stress), the stress response becomes maladaptive and detrimental to physiology e.g., exposure to chronic stressors can cause maladaptive reactions including depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and heart disease.",

      "abstract": "Extract Key points ... Introduction Acute or subacute autonomic failure can be caused by certain drugs and toxins or in association with systemic disorders that affect the nerves more diffusely (e.g. diabetes, amyloidosis). Once these causes are excluded, many cases of acute or subacute autonomic failure may be attributed to autoimmunity targeting the autonomic nerves and/or ganglia. In addition to the time course of the symptoms, several clinical observations support this concept. Subacute autonomic failure may occur in association with known autoimmune neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome or acquired neuromyotonia, or may be associated with occult cancer (paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy). When subacute autonomic neuropathy occurs in isolation, the syndrome often follows a viral prodrome, has a monophasic course, and can be associated with elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and neuron-specific autoantibodies. Until recently, subacute idiopathic autonomic neuropathy was considered to be a pure autonomic variant of the Guillain–Barré syndrome, but recent evidence suggests that some cases, at least, may be due to a specific immune response to the α3-type neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in autonomic ganglia. Indeed, an animal model of autonomic failure has been induced by immunization against α3-type neuronal nicotinic AChR. The manifestations of autoimmune forms of peripheral autonomic failure are reviewed in this chapter with special consideration of autonomic dysfunction in cancer patients and the emerging experimental and laboratory evidence for specific autoantibodies in both cancer and non-cancer cases.",

The anatomical substrates of memory include distributed networks of cortical and subcortical nuclei interconnected by white matter projection pathways. Memory impairments are comorbid with other cognitive and neurobehavioral problems. Disorders such as herpes encephalitis, which has a predilection for limbic and paralimbic cortical regions, may cause an amnestic syndrome associated with other neurobehavioral features, such as personality change and seizures. WM refers to the retention of information over brief intervals of time. Neuropsychological evidence suggests that there are two main types of dysexecutive syndrome, each reflecting dysfunction in the central executive system. One type involves marked perseveration, indicating decreased ability to disengage and shit attention, whereas the other is characterized by excessive distractibility, which reflects impairments in attentional inhibition.",

      "title": "Update on the Neuropathogenesis of Delirium",
      "abstract": "Delirium has been considered a syndrome of generalized dysfunction of higher cortical functions due to its breadth of symptoms and associated diffuse slowing on electroencephalogram. Advances in neuropsychiatry have revealed differences between brain regions, including the hemispheres, which may underlie the constellation of symptoms among different psychiatric disorders. For example, different neural pathways are involved in major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, including lateralization to one or the other hemisphere. In this article the author proposes that delirium, too, involves particular neural pathways and that lateralization to the right may be relevant. Structural and functional neuroimaging reports and recent neuropsychological studies support this lateralization. Prefrontal cortices, anterior and right thalamus, and right basilar mesial temporoparietal cortex may play a significant role in subserving delirium symptoms and may be the 'final common pathway' for delirium from a variety of etiologies. The final common pathway may be responsible for certain 'core symptoms' (disorientation, cognitive deficits, sleep-wake cycle disturbance, disorganized thinking, and language abnormalities), while other symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, illusions, and affective lability) may occur depending on the etiology causing delirium. An imbalance in the cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems is most commonly implicated in causing delirium, and could both account for delirium symptoms and be consistent with the neuroanatomical pathways being implicated.",

      "title": "Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The term \"brain death\" (BD) is used to indicate a clinical situation characterized by the irreversible loss of all brain functions; the identification of this condition is closely linked to the development of intensive care medicine that, with mechanical ventilation, allows the maintenance of somatic functions even when cerebral functions are ceased. BD diagnosis is essentially based on the presence of three cardinal clinic criteria: 1) coma or unresponsiveness, 2) absence of brainstem reflexes 3) absence of spontaneous breathing, evaluated with apnea test. For BD diagnosis the following prerequisites must be scrupolously considered: knowledge of the proximate cause of coma and confirmation of its irreversibility; exclusion of confounding clinical variables (severe electrolyte, acid-base, endocrine disturbances); hypothermia and/or hypotension; drug intoxication or poisoning. Ancillary tests used in BD confirmation are represented by neurophysiological methods to highlight the loss of bioelectrical brain activity (EEG, evoked potential (EP)) and methods for demonstration of cerebral circulatory arrest (TransCranial Doppler (TCD); Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT); conventional Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA); CT angiography; MRI angiography). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ancillary tests are able to confirm the complete cessation of all brain functions and then, in adults, ancillary tests are not needed for the clinical diagnosis of brain death and they should never replace the clinical neurological examination. However, even though ancillary tests are not mandatory but only optional in many countries, they continue to be used, especially when there are factors that may interfere with the complete clinical assessment or when apnea test cannot be performed. Although BD is a relatively simple clinical diagnosis, there are substantial differences in perceptions and practices regarding its declaration among countries, states and even between hospitals worldwide. There are also cultural and religious obstacles—especially in lower-income countries—to the determination of death with neurologic criteria, which lead to the suspension of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, health organizations should implement educational campaigns to improve knowledge and awareness of current criteria among the population, and national and international scientific societies should also make every efforts to validate and standardize clinical and laboratory criteria. Finally, it should reminded and underlined that the ultimate purpose of brain death determination should be to increase the number of organs donated, to improve the quality of life of organ recipients.",

Sudden (lapses) and gradual changes in cognitive performance occur with sleep deprivation or with time of day. The time course of human cognitive processes throughout the day is relevant to the programming of different human activities. The lowest level of cognitive performance occurs during nighttime and early in the morning, a better level occurs around noon, and even higher levels occur during afternoon and evening hours.

However, mostly due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and the complexity of the underlying comorbidities, depression can be difficult to diagnose, resulting in limited recognition and in undertreatment. The early detection and treatment of depression simultaneously with the neurological disorder is key to avoiding deterioration and further disability. Although the neurologist should be able to identify and treat depression initially, a neuropsychiatry team should be available for severe cases and those who are unresponsive to treatment. Neurologists should be also aware that in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, different depression symptoms could develop at different stages of the disease. The treatment options for depression in neurological diseases include drugs, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and somatic interventions, among others, but often, the evidence-based efficacy is limited and the results are highly variable. Here, we review recent research on the diagnosis and treatment of depression in the context of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and strokes, with the aim of identifying common approaches and solutions for its initial management by the neurologist.",

The development of post-traumatic psychopathology depends on individual vulnerability, both genetic and acquired, the nature and severity of the traumatic event, and the quality of the post-traumatic environment. Children who are the victims of abuse or neglect may be particularly profoundly affected by their experience. Even if the stress is only relatively small, if the trauma occurs at a sensitive or critical period of psychological development, a child's cognitive or emotional functioning may not progress normally. The psychopathology of severe personality disorder may thus originate at an early age. Adults who have previously experienced such traumaticevents and who are then involved in later traumatic incidents may be particularly susceptible subsequently to manifest severe psychological disorder. However, even if there is no pre-existing vulnerability, severe trauma can lead to the development of the full range of abnormal psychological symptoms in someone who was previously healthy.",

      "title": "Neuropsychiatric aspects of cognitive impairment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neuropsychiatric symptoms are recognized as important considerations in cognitive impairment but they remain underdiagnosed, understudied, and undertreated. Although they affect most individuals who develop dementia, no medicines have yet been approved in the US for treatment of dementia-related behavioural and emotional problems. Agitation and aggression are the symptoms most likely to require medical intervention. Rates of major depression are markedly increased in dementia patients. Apathy is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome in dementia patients. Psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations are remarkably disruptive to the lives and relationships of people with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been linked to abnormalities of acetylcholine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine systems. Antidepressant, antipsychotic, anti-epileptic, and anti-adrenergic medications have modest effects on some neuropsychiatric symptoms, but all are associated with significant risks. Further study of neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute substantially to our understanding of the neurochemistry, anatomy, and treatment of cognitive disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Dementia is characterized by a decline in memory, language, problem-solving and in other cognitive domains that affect a person's ability to perform everyday activities and social functioning. It is consistently agreed that cognitive impairment is an important risk factor for developing functional disabilities in patients with dementia. Functional status can be conceptualized as the ability to perform self-care, self- maintenance and physical activity. A person with dementia usually requires help with more complex tasks, such as managing bills and finances, or simply maintaining a household. Good functional performance is fundamental for elderly people to maintain independency and avoid institutionalization. The purpose of this review is to describe functional changes in demented patients, evaluating the variability in subgroups of dementias.",

Since it is usually accompanied by nervousness, anxiety and other negative emotions, return to health can be longer than necessary. Hence much attention is paid to medical interventions which allow pain relief or a total elimination thereof. In some circumstances, however, they may be inadequate, that is why other, extra-medical factors are being explored.

      "abstract": "Insomnia generally is defined a subjective report of difficulty falling sleep, difficulty staying asleep, early awakening, or nonrestorative sleep. It is one of the most common health complaints among the general population. In pathogenesis of insomnia predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors play an important role. Predisposing factors include arousal-prone personality, elevated baseline physiologic arousal, rigid circadian system, and other individual characteristics that make one vulnerable to or set the stage for the development of insomnia. Precipitating factors are the events or conditions that trigger the insomnia. Common examples include life stressors and change of sleep-wake schedule. The perpetuating factors, such conditioning of bedtime cues with arousal, maladaptive sleep-wake habits and worries over sleeplessness, then should become the focus of the treatment. Pharmacologic and non-pharmacological methods of treatment are used in the management of insomnia. In the case of the diagnosis of transient or short-term insomnia, a basic method of treatment is usually administrating the right hypnotics and information on the sleep hygiene. In chronic insomnia, a basic treatment is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which can help pharmacologically by regular use of sedative and hypnotic antidepressant medication in the evening only as needed taking hypnotics drugs (no more than 2-3 times a week).",

      "title": "Disorders of attention: a frontier in neuropsychology",
      "abstract": "There is an extensive behavioural neurological literature on so-called unilateral attentional disorders, but a striking paucity of papers on global disorders of attention, i.e. confusional states. However, confusional states are distinctive because: (1) they are the most common disturbance of the higher functions in clinical practice, by orders of magnitude; (2) they are the only disturbance of the higher functions from which all normal subjects have suffered; (3) they have characteristic clinical manifestations; (4) they are frequently misdiagnosed as progressive dementias, aphasia, memory disorders, and psychoses; (5) they are the only disturbance of the higher functions that commonly cause patients to produce statements that appear to be extremely witty; (6) they can be readily studied experimentally; (7) they are the most common cause of unconcern with or denial of illness. There are almost certainly several different forms of confusional state depending on the aetiology, the rate of development, the age, and the anatomical systems involved, but little classification has yet been carried on. Confusional states are most simply defined as disorders in which there is a loss of the normal coherence of thought or action. Among the striking clinical features are: (1) failure to pay attention, excessive distractibility, or failure to shift attention; (2) paramnesias, i.e. distortions of memory; (3) reduplicative phenomena, ‘wild’ paraphasias with ‘propagation’ of error, alterations of mood in many different directions; (4) isolated or predominant disturbance of writing (the most common cause of pure agraphia); (5) unconcern with or denial of illness; (6) apparently playful behaviour. While confusional states are usually attributed to ‘global involvement of the brain’ as a result of metabolic or toxic disorder, there are in fact many cases produced by focal infarctions in the right hemisphere, which, in the experience of my department, is one of the commonest effects of cerebrovascular disease. Brief reference is made to the prognosis, and to the theoretical significance for cerebral dominance and the evolutionary development of cerebral dominance in non-human species.",

      "title": "First seizure definitions and worldwide incidence and mortality",
      "abstract": "Summary While all patients with epilepsy experience seizures, not all individuals with seizures have epilepsy. Seizures may be acute symptomatic or unprovoked. Acute symptomatic seizures are seizures occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Unprovoked seizures are seizures occurring in the absence of precipitating factors and may be caused by a static injury (remote symptomatic seizures) or a progressing injury (progressive symptomatic seizures). Unprovoked seizures may be single or recurrent (epilepsy). The incidence of acute symptomatic seizures is 29–39 per 100,000 per year. These predominate in men, in the youngest age class, and in the elderly. Traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, drug withdrawal, infarction, and metabolic insults are the commonest causes. The incidence of single unprovoked seizures is 23–61 per 100,000 person‐years. As with epilepsy, single unprovoked seizures predominate in men and in patients less than 12 months and older than 65 years. Studies on the mortality of acute symptomatic seizures are lacking. A standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 2.3 has been reported in patients experiencing a single unprovoked seizure. The SMR in patients with a newly diagnosed unprovoked seizure ranges from 2.5 to 4.1 according to the study population and design. The SMR is highest in the youngest patients and in those with symptomatic seizures.",

      "title": "Interphase between skin, psyche, and society: A narrative review",
      "abstract": "Disorders of the skin affect the psyche of a person significantly. The interplay between internal and external world can be depicted through the various skin reactions in regard to psychological or physiological stimuli. Psychocutaneous illness could be exclusively psychological or stress related or due to strong psychogenic factors. As per biopsychosocial model, it could be primary, multifactorial, or secondary to disfigurement. Whichever is the condition, invariably stress is a major contributing factor in prognosis and onset of disorders of the skin. Self-explanation, myth, stigma, and diminished self-confidence often lead to depression and suicidality followed by active avoidance of the workplace, in turn, causing significant disability in the individual. The conflict between self-image and perceived image frequently causes fear of rejection leading to social anxiety, reduced self-confidence, interpersonal communication, and impaired sexual intimacy with a partner. Maladaptive sets of coping strategies such as alexithymia, shame proneness, avoidance, concealment, and escape are very common among the sufferers which impair the attachment with family and friends. Children are the extreme sufferers as they develop inferiority, low self-esteem, loss of body image, and social withdrawal leading to rejection from parents and faulty development of attachment pattern. Hence, disorders of the skin can lead to impaired coping, impaired compliance, limitations in quality of life, negative body image, and stigmatization which invariably cause psychological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, phobia, and somatoform and adjustment disorders. Hence, there is a direct relationship between skin, mind, and society which we are going to explore in a detailed fashion to understand its impact on the psyche and the society.",

This is because the addictive thinking, feeling and acting is the dominant defense that blocks success in therapy. The therapist and the patient therefore externally symbolize with chairs 1. The patient’s healthy adult thinking, 2. His self-protection through his addictive thinking and feeling, and 3. His symptoms in everyday life. They develop further his addictive thinking and feeling in the as-if mode of play and paradoxically work out the positive meaning of this defense within the framework of his self-regulation. The patient’s self-development initially should take place in the symptom production. This is because metacognitive confusion prevents patients with addiction from adequately processing deeper conflicts. The patient should first gain ego control over his addictive self-regulation. This disorder-specific approach is indicated for harmful use or dependence on alcohol or drugs, and also for non-substance-related addictions such as eating disorders, internet addiction, sex addiction, and other addictions. It makes the experiences of Alcoholics Anonymous fruitful in digested form for depth psychological, behavioral, and systemic therapy.",

Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest. The best examples are probably stroke and cardiovascular disease.

Le traumatisme craniocerebral (TCC) implique un coup plus ou moins violent a la tete et il peut se produire a divers moments et dans divers lieux : accident de la route ou au travail ou encore lors d'une activite de loisir ou d'une activite sportive. Il y a trois niveaux : le TCC leger, modere et grave. Les deux dernieres categories (TCC modere et grave) impliquent un coma plus ou moins long et le reveil est souvent compare a une deuxieme naissance ou l'on doit tout reapprendre. Souvent, le TCC est caracterise par des sequelles persistantes qui ont la particularite d'etre invisibles. Ainsi, les proches et les ami(e)s et aussi les autres personnes rencontrees peuvent avoir de la difficulte a saisir les changements causes par le TCC ; ceci peut laisser place a de la stigmatisation. Nous avons fait des entretiens semi-diriges avec des personnes ayant survecu a un TCC modere ou grave pour pouvoir les questionner sur leur experience de vie a leur retour a la vie « normale ». Le handicap est le theme central de notre recherche, et a l'aide du modele du Processus de production du handicap (PPH) propose par Fougeyrollas et al. (1998), nous avons observe l'importance du role des facteurs personnels (sequelles) et surtout de l'impact des facteurs environnementaux (famille, ami(e)s, organismes et institutions, etc.) sur la reduction ou l'augmentation des habitudes de vie (situation de handicap). Pour faire la demonstration que la personne ayant survecu a un TCC n'est pas un acteur passif face a sa situation de handicap, nous avons utilise le concept « d'agir » propose par Hurtubise et Roy (2007). Cela a permis d'illustrer les diverses strategies qu'utilise une personne vivant avec un TCC pour faire face aux differents obstacles. Nous avons identifie cinq types d'actions : l'evitement, la paralysie, la contrainte, le bricolage et la tactique. Toutes les personnes de notre recherche n'ont pas fait un retour a leur vie d'avant l'accident mais ils ont tous trouve de nouvelles habitudes de vie adaptees a leur situation ; plusieurs doivent et devront faire face a des obstacles en lien avec le TCC.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : traumatisme crânien, handicap invisible, liminalite, agir, stigmatisation",

      "abstract": "Depressive mood, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations and behavioral disturbances have been traditionally recognized as leading symptoms of mental disorders. However, cognitive symptoms went under-recognized or declined. Today there is robust evidence that cognitive dysfunction is present in the majority of mental disorders and is also related to impairments in the functioning of the persons with mental illness. It is proposed that aberrant brain neuronal network connectivity, arising from interplay of genetic, epigenetic, developmental and environmental factors, is responsible for cognitive decline. In schizophrenia, dysfunctions in working memory, attention, processing speed, visual and verbal learning with substantial deficit in reasoning, planning, abstract thinking and problem solving have been extensively documented. Social cognition - the ability to correctly process information and use it to generate appropriate response in situations, is also impaired. The correlation of cognitive impairment with functional outcome and employment, independent living and social functioning has emphasized the need for development of the treatments specific to cognition. It is considered that brain neuroplasticity allows for re-modulating and compensating the impairment process which could give opportunity to improve cognitive functions. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive clinical assessment and follow-up of cognitive decline in mental illness. Implementation of specific treatment strategies addressing cognitive decline in mental illness, like new drugs, distinct cognitive-behavioural therapy, psychoeducation, social skills training and remediation strategies should be strongly indorsed targeting recovery and reduction of disability due to mental illness.",

      "title": "An improved understanding of neuropathic pain",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain represents a series of relatively uncommon chronic pain conditions, caused by lesions or dysfunctions of peripheral or central afferent pathways in the nervous system. The symptoms and signs of neuropathic pain can all be explained by a neuronal hyperexcitability at the site of the nerve lesion, which subsequently and in a dynamic fashion recruits more central sites. The manifestations of such neuronal hyperexcitability are therefore rather similar, irrespective of the causes or sites of the lesions. The key findings in neuropathic pain are: (a) pain in an area with sensory loss; (b) positive sensory symptoms such as dysesthaesia and allodynia in the injured area, where sensory discrimination is abolished; and (c) an abnormal sympathetic activity. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuronal hyperexcitability has increased dramatically within the last decade, and accordingly, it has been suggested that pain be classified according to a mechanism‐based approach. The challenge for an improved understanding of neuropathic pain—which is the key for better treatment—lies in elucidating the relationships between symptoms, signs, aetiology, anatomical lesions, and underlying mechanisms. At present, this is not a trivial task. © 2002 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

La cirugia funcional ha adquirido gran relevancia en el tratamiento de las complicaciones motoras de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) avanzada, y menos conocida es la influencia de la estimulacion cerebral profunda (ECP) en los sintomas no motores (SNM). Objetivo. Revisar la bibliografia sobre ECP y SNM en la EP. Desarrollo. Los resultados de la cirugia funcional sobre los SNM de la EP son variables en los distintos estudios. Algunos sintomas mejoran -trastornos del sueno, dolor o disconfort, trastornos obsesivo-compulsivos- y empeoran o aparecen otros -fluencia verbal, apatia, aumento de peso-. En estudios aislados se encuentra mejoria en memoria de trabajo, secuenciacion visuomotora y razonamiento, algunos trastornos digestivos, genitourinarios, de termorregulacion y olfativos, y empeoran la memoria verbal (recuerdo diferido) y visuoespacial, la velocidad psicomotora y la funcion ejecutiva, mientras que otros sintomas -hipotension ortostatica- no muestran cambios. Existen otros factores, ademas de la estimulacion, que pueden modificar los SNM, como la vulnerabilidad preoperatoria individual, la disminucion de medicacion dopaminergica tras la cirugia, la propia EP y los cambios psicosociales. En pacientes con perfiles determinados pueden existir riesgos especificos -mayor riesgo de alteracion cognitiva en pacientes de mas de 69 anos o con alteracion cognitiva precirugia; mayor riesgo de depresion, mania o suicidio en pacientes con patologia psiquiatrica previa-. Conclusiones. Es necesario valorar el riesgo-beneficio individualmente para obtener resultados optimos con este tratamiento. Se requieren estudios multicentricos que permitan esclarecer el papel de la ECP sobre los SNM.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Advances in resuscitation and the advent of modern intensive care techniques to support the circulation challenge the simple definition of death in terms of loss of spontaneous circulation (‘cardiac death’). Instead, death is now better regarded as an irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness combined with irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe. Since the brainstem is required for both consciousness and spontaneous breathing, irreversible loss of brainstem function (e.g. after trauma, haemorrhage, or hypoxia/ischaemia) defines the state of ‘brainstem death’. Clinical criteria for the diagnosis of brainstem death have been published, but practice varies around the world. Brainstem death lies at the extreme end of this spectrum and is, by definition, permanent. Unlike those with brainstem death, patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness may survive for many years without physiological support. The care of such patients has huge social, societal, ethical, and economic implications.",

Time spent on it is well worth while. The poor witness can be helped by leading questions. After taking the detailed history it should be possible to list the probable site or sites of the nervous system affected, from muscle to cerebral cortex. Also, from the course of development of the symptoms (for example, whether episodic or progressive), it should be possible to suggest the likely pathological diagnosis. For example, vascular lesions tend to cause sudden or episodic symptoms; cerebral tumours more often cause slowly progressive symptoms.",

These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep).

FMD can have serious negative impact on daily function and thus constitute a secondary stress factor that drives a “vicious circle“ of stress, cognitive impairment und underperformance.

      "title": "Insulin Neuritis and Diabetic Cachectic Neuropathy: A Review",
      "abstract": "Diabetic patients can be affected by a wide range of peripheral nerve disorders, the rarer of which are often poorly recognised and understood. “Insulin neuritis” or “treatment induced neuropathy” is a reversible disorder characterised by acute severe distal limb pain, peripheral nerve fibre damage and autonomic dysfunction, preceded by a period of rapid glycaemic control. The condition has been reported in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics treated with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents who typically have a history of poor glycaemic control. Pathogenesis of the condition and its associated pain is poorly understood, with proposed mechanisms including endoneurial ischaemia, hypoglycaemic microvascular neuronal damage and regenerating nerve firing. Pain can affect other areas including the trunk and abdomen, or be more generalised. “Diabetic neuropathic cachexia” is a rare disorder associated with poor diabetic control that presents with large amounts of unintentional weight loss associated with an acute symmetrical painful peripheral neuropathy without weakness. Pain is characteristically burning in nature with predominant lower limb involvement and allodynia. The disorder can also affect type 1 and type 2 diabetics and occur irrespective of the duration of their diabetes. Depression and in males, impotence, appear to be common, although other autonomic features can be present. Typically it has a monophasic course but has been reported to be recurrent. As with insulin neuritis, this condition is reversible over weeks to months after adequate diabetic control. For both disorders, the pain can be treatment resistant despite the use of multiple analgesics. Keywords: Cachexia, diabetes, insulin, neuropathy, neuritis, treatment",

      "abstract": "Modified state of consciousness (MSC) is defined as a mental state that can be subjectively recognized by an individual or by an objective observer of the individual, as representing a difference in the psychological functioning of the “normal” state, alert and awake of the individual. Drugs are products with definitions and conceptual boundaries, historically defined. The use of psychoactive drugs is related to the increased plasticity of human subjectivity which is reflected in various technical means to change the perception, cognition, affect and mood. The authors propose to conduct a literature review on the types of MSC, the way to achieve them and their implications in drug consumption pattern. A MSC consists of dimensions such as self-oceanic limitlessness, agonizing self-dissolution and visionary restructuring. Normal MSC includes dreams, hypnagogic state and sleep. Others may be induced by hypnosis, meditation or psychoactive substances. Those achieved by drugs allow the subject to access feelings and sensations which go beyond the everyday reality or, on the other hand, leakage of reality. Anthropological studies show that in almost all civilizations, man sought ways to induce MSC. What characterizes the problematic or abusive use of certain substances is not necessarily the amount and frequency of drug use, but the disharmony in the socio-cultural, family and psychosocial contexts of the individual.

This attribution of two meanings to one term has led to considerable confusion. Thus it is often claimed that depression may be present in almost any mental illness. This statement may be true in the sense that the mood of depression may occur in almost any mental illness; but it cannot be true in the sense that the depressive syndrome may enter into almost any mental illness, since the term depressive syndrome has already, at least by implication, been used to denote a particular symptom:sign cluster which differentiates it from all other symptom:sign clusters.

The apparent overlap between fibromyalgia and other syndromes, such as chronic fatigue and irritable bowel, is not sufficient cause to consider all these syndromes as manifestations of a single syndrome. Fibromyalgia is a multifaceted problem. Central afferent pain amplification and perhaps also impaired descending pain inhibition are supposed to underlie widespread pain. Neuroendocrine perturbations, sleep disturbances, health beliefs, mood disorder, and physical deconditioning play a role in the modulation and perseverance of pain and other symptoms. It is extremely difficult to mitigate chronic generalized pain and to deal with other symptoms in fibromyalgia. A uniform intervention strategy is missing. Essential in the tailored management of fibromyalgia are an enhancement of functional capacities and quality of life, and the symptomatic treatment of individual symptoms such as pain, distress, and sleep disturbances. Rather than analysing monotherapy per se, the objective in future evaluations should be to try to find the combined pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment of choice for specific subgroups of patients.",

      "abstract": "Even though most cancer patients do not meet diagnostic criteria for any specific mental disorder [1], many experience symptoms such as anxiety and sleep disturbances that may interfere with their overall adjustment to their disease. Anxiety is a common reaction to a cancer diagnosis and a normal response to perceived threats like loss of body functions, alterations in appearance, family disruption, death, etc. Anxiety may persist throughout the disease process, affecting the patient’s quality of life significantly, and often coexists with depression in cancer patients. Anxiety tends to appear or worsen at critical points during the course of the illness (diagnosis, beginning and end of treatment, recurrence, survival and terminal stage).\r\n\r\nSleep disorders are frequently associated with the psychological impact of cancer as well as with the physical illness itself, pain, hospitalisation and specific medical treatments. Altered sleep adversely affects emotional wellbeing and daytime performance, and may be an early sign of delirium in the oncology setting. In the general population, persistent insomnia has been associated with a higher risk of developing clinical anxiety or depression [2].\r\n\r\nTo effectively adjust patient needs to optimal treatment interventions, health-care professionals must be able to distinguish normal adjustment to cancer from altered reactions to the disease.

      "title": "The cognitive pattern of vascular dementia and its assessment",
      "abstract": "Prevailing definitions of dementia are based on the Alzheimer disease (AD) model, which places major emphasis on memory impairment. In other dementias, such as vascular dementia (VaD), several other cognitive dysfunctions predominate over the memory disorder. The cognitive pattern changes according to the type of VaD. In multi-infarct dementia (MID), cortical lesions may cause loss of instrumental functions manifested by aphasia, amnesia, apraxia, or agnosia. Language in MID patients has shorter phrase length, restricted lexical variability, simplified syntax, and low verbal fluency; dysarthria or mechanical impairment of speech with abnormal pitch, melody, or articulation rate also occur. The latter are rare in degenerative dementias. Compared with AD, patients with MID demonstrate superior performance on verbal learning and memory, better delayed recall, and lower rates of forgetting, intrusions, and false positives. Subcortical ischemic dementia, subcortical hemorrhages, or single subcortical strategic infarcts frequently impair executive functions, attention, and speed of information processing; anterograde memory is generally less impaired than in AD patients. The two main problems of batteries used for evaluation of dementia such as those recommended by CERAD (verbal fluency test, a brief naming test such as the Modified Boston Naming Test, free recall of a word list, with immediate and delayed recall, followed by a recognition task of the same words, and line drawings of figures), as well as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), are (1) their strong emphasis on memory, temporal and spatial orientation, calculation, language, and constructional praxis, and (2) their failure to assess executive functions. Simple tests of executive function include the Trail Making Test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and the EXIT-25. A simple and effective test is the CLOX, an executive variation of the clock-drawing task. Depressive symptoms and other psychiatric disturbances are particularly common in VaD and become sources of cognitive and functional disability. Several questionnaires assess the neuropsychiatric manifestations of dementia including the Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory (NPI), the BEHAVE-AD test, the Cohen-Mansfield Scale, and the CERAD Behavioral Rating Scale for Dementia. Finally, development of dementia after a stroke may represent true VaD in patients with intact cognition before the stroke, or AD + CVD when the dementia occurs in patients that already had memory problems before the ictus. The diagnosis of VaD is a challenging clinical problem that encompasses the fields of medicine, neurology, psychiatry, and psychology.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Extensive neuropsychological testing is reported on a 30-year-old patient (TA) with amnesia persisting 3 ½ years after a major whiplash injury. TAs brain was investigated repeatedly with static and dynamic imaging techniques (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography) without detecting signs indicative for her amnesia. This amnesia started immediately after the whiplash injury and made the former university student totally dependent on her mother's care and guidance. TA is disoriented with respect to time. She demonstrates a sharp border between superior knowledge of facts and episodes from the time prior to whiplash injury and no memories at all for the period after it. The amnesia is global and persistent in spite of superior intelligence. It is concluded that traumatic, stressful events can induce persistent memory blocks even in the absence of measurable brain injury. Furthermore, it is proposed that there are several stages of memory formation, and that both environmental and internal processes may block or interfere with a smooth information transfer. The consequence may be measurable as delayed amnesia. Key Words: whiplash injuryepisodic memoryretrograde amnesiapositron emission tomography",

Chron-ic widespread pain is the deﬁning feature of FM, but patients may also exhibit a range of other symptoms, includingsleep disturbance, fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, headaches, and mood disorders. The etiology of FM is not com-pletely understood and the syndrome is inﬂuenced by factors such as stress, medical illness, and a variety of pain con-ditions. Establishing diagnosis may be difﬁcult because of the multifaceted nature of the syndrome and overlap withother chronically painful conditions. A unifying hypothesis is that FM results from sensitization of the central nervoussystem; this new concept could justify the variety of characteristics of the syndrome. FM symptoms can be muscu-loskeletal, non-musculoskeletal, or a combination of both; and many patients will also experience a host of associat-ed symptoms or conditions. The ACR classiﬁcation criteria focus only on pain and disregard other important symp-toms; but three key features, pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance, are present in virtually every patient with FM. Sev-eral other associated syndromes, including circulatory, nervous, digestive, urinary and reproductive systems are prob-ably a part of the so called central sensitivity or sensitization syndrome. A minority subgroup of patients (30-40%) hasa signiﬁcant psychological disturbance. Psychological factors are an important determinant of any type of pain, andpsychological comorbidity is frequent in FM. Psychiatric disorders most commonly described are mood disorders, butpsychiatric illness is not a necessary factor in the etiopathogenesis of FM.",

      "title": "Seizures",
      "abstract": "Seizures occur when bursts of uncontrolled electrical activity translate into motor activity. Seizure activity takes on a variety of presentations, depending upon the patient and the degree to which one or both cerebral hemispheres are involved. Generalized seizures are characterized by whole-body involvement, collapse, and loss of consciousness. Patients often exhibit extensor rigidity in all four limbs. Limbs also frequently demonstrate paddling behavior. Unconscious behaviors, such as chewing, licking, swallowing, and vocalizing, may emerge during seizure activity. Autonomic signs may also appear. It is not uncommon for patients to lose control over their urinary bladders or bowels. At times, seizures may be difficult to differentiate from syncopal episodes. Thorough history taking may help to distinguish the two. Partial seizures, on the other hand, may resemble dyskinesias. Partial seizures involve one region of one cerebral hemisphere, and may therefore target any part of the body. The neck, trunk, or limbs are most commonly involved. There are many causes of seizures, regardless of whether they are generalized or partial. For ease of consideration, causes of seizure activity may be described as being intra- or extracranial. These categories prioritize differentials differently based upon the patient's age. In a pediatric patient, meaning one that is less than one year of age, seizures are most likely due to a developmental defect or traumatic injury. Other common causes of pediatric seizures include hepatic encephalopathy (HE), as from a portosystemic shunt (PSS) or neonatal hypoglycemia. Young adult to middle-aged patients, on the other hand, are more likely to develop idiopathic epilepsy, as compared to seniors, which are more likely to develop intracranial neoplasia. Most seizures are self-limiting. However, a fraction of seizures may become protracted, either in terms of their duration or frequency. Cluster seizures occur when the frequency of seizures exceeds two over a 24-h period. Status epilepticus occurs when either a seizure lasts for more than 5 min, or multiple seizures overlap such that patient recovery time between events is eliminated. Status epilepticus is a medical emergency.",

Generally, writer's cramp is characterized by muscular spasm, inco-cordination, and discomfort, variously described as fatigue, weakness, stiffness, or pain when attempting to write. Occasionally, there is an accompanying tremor or jerking of the involved upper limb. There is said to be great variability in the detailed clinical picture. Writing may be difficult or impossible, but outside the act of writing the symptoms generally disappear. Often there are fluctuations within a chronically progressive course but the condition may arrest at any stage of its development.",

Meanwhile, constipation, including symptoms of evacuation difficulty and/or fewer bowel movements, is a common problem as people age. Risk factors include problems in cognition, mobility, gastrointestinal motility, dysautonomia, anorectal dysfunction, and disabling neurologic disorders. Faecal incontinence is more common in frail individuals but is often assessed inadequately. The cause is often multifactorial. Treatment depends on the cause: a combination of approaches may be necessary, including avoidance of faecal impaction, instigation of a structured bowel care plan including regular prompted toileting, dietary modification, and (in some cases) use of loperamide or similar medications.",

      "abstract": "Impaired mental function, from clouding of consciousness to deep coma is often seen in patients with systemic inflammation. Diagnosis of this syndrome which is called \"septic encephalopathy\" is dependent on exclusion of other causes. The underlying mechanisms have only been defined in parts. The appearance of cerebral symptoms during an infection increases mortality. Primary symptoms of septic encephalopathy appear early, before other septic organ manifestations become apparent. The most sensible parameter for diagnosis of septic encephalopathy in comatose patients or under sedation is the EEG. It shows general alterations which increase parallelly to the severity of septic encephalopathy. Septic encephalopathy has to be considered a multifactorial event. In an early stage of the development of septic encephalopathy, bacteremia induces overproduction of cytokines and other mediators. This causes metabolic dysregulation with effects on the cerebral protein-, glucose and neurotransmitter metabolism. In addition, cytokines damage the blood-brain-barrier and exert direct cytotoxic effects. This results in histologic detectable neuronal damage. Further effects of the cytokine expression are perivascular edema and hemorrhage. The loss of metabolic regulation of the brain perfusion and local cerebral ischemia additionally contribute to the etiology of septic encephalopathy. A specific therapy is not yet known.",

Seizures (altered brain wave [electrophysiological] patterns) present clinically as abnormal consciousness with or without tonic/clonic convulsions (where \"tonic\" = stiffening and \"clonic\" = involuntary rhythmical movements). Neuropathological findings following seizures may be detected using many methods. Neuro-imaging may show a structural abnormality underlying seizures, such as focal cortical dysplasia or hippocampal sclerosis in patients with chronic epilepsy. Neural cell type-specific biomarkers in blood or cerebrospinal fluid may highlight neuronal damage and/or glial reactions but are not specific indicators of seizures while serum electrolyte and glucose imbalances may induce seizures. Gross observations and brain weights generally are unaffected by TAs with seizurogenic potential, but microscopic evaluation may reveal seizure-related neuron death in some brain regions (especially neocortex, hippocampus, and/or cerebellum). Current globally accepted best practices for neural sampling in nonclinical general toxicity studies provide a suitable screen for brain regions that are known sites of electrical disruption and/or display seizure-induced neural damage. Conventional nonclinical studies can afford an indication that a TA has a potential seizure liability (via in-life signs and/or microscopic evidence of neuron necrosis), but confirmation requires measuring brain electrical (electroencephalographic) activity in a nonclinical study.",

Two phenomena are conventionally included under the name 'confabulation'. The first type concerns 'untrue' utterances of subjects with memory impairment; often provoked or elicited by the interviewer, these confabulations are accompanied by little conviction and are believed by most clinicians to be caused by the (conscious or unconscious) need to 'cover up' for some memory deficit. Researchers wanting to escape the 'intentionality' dilemma have made use of additional factors such as presence of frontal lobe pathology, dysexecutive syndrome, difficulty with the temporal dating of memories leading to an inability temporally to string out memory data, etc.",

      "title": "Does Your Patient Have a Psychiatric Illness or Nonverbal Learning Disorder? Clinical Clues Help Differentiate Overlapping Symptoms and Syndromes",
      "abstract": "Patients who present with impairment in academic, cognitive, social, and vocational functioning might be struggling with an unrecognized learning disorder. Ten percent of the US population has some form of learning disability, and up to 40% of those with learning disorders may meet diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric disorder. (1), (2) Some learning disorders affect a person's ability to read, write, or do math, whereas less - recognized nonverbal learning disorder (NLD) impacts the social and emotional functioning of children, adolescents, and adults. Common features of NLD include: * deficits in nonlinguistic information processing * speech prosody deficits * difficulty reading facial expressions * associated impairment in interpersonal functioning. The severity of these deficits varies among individuals with NLD. Patients may experience chronic low self-esteem, anxiety, and mood symptoms because of their limited ability to express their feelings within an appropriate social context. NLD may be first misdiagnosed as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BD), or Asperger's disorder. In this article we review the underlying neurophysiology of NLD and present a clinical approach to these patients, including the differential diagnosis and factors that will allow clinicians to distinguish NLD from psychiatric conditions with symptomatic and syndromic overlap. We also describe treatment for patients with NLD. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Table 1 Clinical manifestation of nonverbal learning disorder Tactile - perceptual deficits and psychomotor coordination deficiencies, usually more marked on the left side Visual - spatial organization deficits Deficiencies in nonverbal problem solving, such as hypothesis testing and understanding cause - effect relationships Difficulty adapting to novel situations and reliance on rote behaviors Relative deficiencies in mechanical arithmetic with proficiencies in reading, word recognition, and spelling Well developed rote verbal - memory skills Verbosity characterized by poor pragmatics Deficits in social perception, judgment, and interaction source: reference 7 The learning process Learning is a cognitive process of acquiring and processing information and experiences from the environment that allows us to acquire knowledge, skills, and social abilities. When we learn how to relate to others, we undergo neurophysiology changes that subsequently influence behavior and the way we understand our environment. Deficits in learning processes or the ability to acquire relational skills result in impaired affect regulation in regard to others and may lead to low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, interpersonal conflict, and anger toward others. Learning influences a person's ability to navigate social relationships and perform academically and occupationally. The impact of learning deficits may be magnified in adulthood after an individual has suffered years of insecurities and poor self-esteem. Adults with learning disabilities often seek psychiatric treatment as a result of their disappointment about difficulties in relationships and work. NLD may coexist with or mimic other neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, problematic behavior within a family or at the workplace I is a common reason for referral to a psychiatrist. These behaviors may be influenced by a patient's NLD symptoms, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. Persons with NLD are at increased risk for depression because of failures in coping, loss of self-esteem, internalized psychopathology, and other social and emotional strains. In addition, individuals with NLD may experience multiple psychosocial impairments, including difficulty maintaining employment, achieving goals, and maintaining relationships. …",

      "abstract": "Kernaussagen Definition und Diagnostik Die Diagnose Anpassungsstörung gehört zu den im DSM-IV und im ICD-10 eher weniger gut operationalisierten Kategorien. Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

      "title": "THE ROLE OF THE PITUITARY GLAND IN EPILEPSY",
      "abstract": "The problem of epilepsy may be best approached by considering all convulsions which are accompanied by unconsciousness, whether periodic or otherwise, as symptoms of some underlying pathologic state or disease.By doing this the convulsion becomes a symptom.The question then arises, which I believe should be answered in the negative, whether any so-called epileptic state should, of itself, be con- sidered a disease. ETIOLOGIC FACTORSThus, among the underlying causes of convulsions are uremia, eclampsia and other toxicoses; several varieties of trauma, as birth trauma and that from blows on the head; certain intracranial irrita- tions, as brain tumors and cerebral hemorrhages; certain infections, as syphilis and varieties of meningitis; certain conditions of cerebral maldevelopment accompanied by a degree of brain cell deterioration; and certain conditions of the pituitary gland causing a change in its secretion.I believe, therefore, that convulsions, whether periodical and termed epilepsy, or not, are due to definite pathologic cerebral tissue changes which may be congenital or induced, and hence, that epilepsy is an organic and not a functional condition.In the toxic and pituitary cases there may exist previous malformation and instability of the cortical cells, or, on the other hand, it is perfectly conceivable that the toxic substance or the changed pituitary secretion may produce their own cortical cell deterioration.I published a paper on the relation of the pituitary gland to some cases of epilepsy, and in 19141 and again in 1916,2 a paper on the subject of hypopituitarism in its relation to epilepsy.These papers were the result of a personal suggestion of Dr. Harvey Cushing and also of the perusal of his most excellent book.",

Acute neurologic conditions produce sudden plot twists and are thus frequently used in screenplays. Dark Victory is a farce when it comes to neurologic manifestations of a brain tumor. Motor neuron disease is not a topic readily chosen by screenwriters, and when it is used, it seems to fall into the general categories of \"severe disability\" and \"dying from an untreatable disorder.\" In The Hawaiians, there is a very brief scene showing crippled lepers separated on an island who are pushed away by the lead actor in the film. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has clear criteria for somnambulism that include persistence of sleep or impaired judgment during ambulation and a disturbance that is not better explained by other disorders, drug use, or substance-use disorder.",

      "title": "Estudio comparativo de las alteraciones cognitivas de un grupo de adultos jóvenes diagnosticados de hipotiroidismo subclínico frente a un grupo de individuos control",
      "abstract": "En la practica clinica diaria es muy importante identificar todos los factores anadidos que pueden modificar los rendimientos intelectuales de los pacientes que consultan por quejas u olvidos en su memoria. Estos cambios cognitivos pueden ser debidos a multiples factores sin necesidad de que exista un proceso degenerativo que los origine: las enfermedades cerebrovasculares, las patologias generales con repercusion cerebral, tanto en estadio clinico como (hipertension, diabetes, endocrinopatias, farmacos, infecciones, traumatismos, etc), la depresion, la falta de motivacion, el aislamiento social y otras patologias psiquiatricas, ademas de diversas limitaciones sensoriales y motoras.\nLa influencia de la funcion tiroidea en la cognicion parece interesante y desde el punto de vista clinico relevante, debido a que de forma tradicional las alteraciones tiroideas se han incluido como una causa secundaria y reversible tanto de problemas en la cognicion como en el estado de animo. Con relativa frecuencia se detecta la presencia de en el estudio analitico de extension que habitualmente se realiza a los pacientes que consultan por quejas subjetivas de memoria. El termino designa una situacion en la que un paciente asintomatico tiene una fraccion libre de T4 en el limite bajo de la normalidad pero con un nivel elevado de TSH. Una serie de evidencias crecientes, tambien relacionan al hipotiroidismo subclinico con alteraciones en el area cognitiva y en el area de la conducta. Pero la cuestion sobre si los pacientes con presentan sintomas y si los posibles sintomas son reversibles con terapia hormonal, continua siendo en la actualidad un tema de debate muy controvertido y con muchas dudas por resolver.\nLos objetivos de nuestro estudio pretenden comprobar mediante una bateria de test neuropsicologicos dos cuestiones principales. En primer lugar, si la presencia de en un grupo de pacientes establece a nivel cognitivo diferencias clinicamente relevantes frente a un grupo de individuos control. En segundo lugar, si la presencia de en un grupo de pacientes determina la presencia de un mayor numero de cuadros depresivos frente a un grupo de individuos control.\n Se seleccionan pacientes consecutivos evaluados de forma ambulatoria y diagnosticados previamente de subclinico. En funcion de la edad, sexo y nivel educativo de los pacientes, se seleccionan de forma dirigida un grupo de sujetos para utilizarlo como grupo control. Los grupos seleccionados son homogeneos, en cuanto a la variable edad, sexo y nivel educativo. Se realiza una primera evaluacion analitica basal de los niveles sericos de TSH, T4L y anticuerpos antitiroideos, para posteriormente realizar una analitica de control a los seis meses. Se realiza una evaluacion neuropsicologica en la visita basal y una reevaluacion de control a los seis meses. Despues de la visita basal se administran suplementos de hormona tiroidea (L-tiroxina), segun los criterios establecidos por el endocrinologo responsable del seguimiento clinico de los pacientes.\nEl estudio agrupa a un total de 60 sujetos. En el grupo control se incluyen a 23 individuos eutiroideos y en el grupo de pacientes 37 sujetos diagnosticados de subclinico. En el 22,41% de los pacientes se detectan anticuerpos positivos. Solo 8 pacientes presentan niveles de TSH iguales o superiores a 10 mU/L. Los pacientes incluidos en el estudio no presentan mayor numero de quejas subjetivas de memoria que los pacientes del grupo control. El tiempo de ejecucion del Test del Trazo es superior en los pacientes con (p 0,04), y frente a los pacientes con un nivel de TSH inferior a 10mU/L (p<0,04). Los pacientes con anticuerpos antitiroideos positivos describen un mayor numero de quejas u olvidos que los individuos del grupo control (p<0,02), y que los pacientes con anticuerpos negativos (p<0,007). La puntuacion en el Test de Evocacion Categorial fue significativamente inferior en los pacientes con anticuerpos antitiroideos frente a los pacientes con anticuerpos negativos (p<0,0515) y tambien frente al grupo de individuos control (p<0,008). Los pacientes que finalizan el estudio y mantienen criterios analiticos de pero niveles de TSH<10mU/L, no presentan mayor numero de quejas subjetivas de memoria, ni alteraciones cognitivas relevantes que la poblacion control. Estos resultados no estan influenciados por la presencia de un mayor numero de cuadros depresivos.\nLa instauracion del tratamiento sustitutivo, mejora significativamente la puntuacion de los test que evaluan funciones de memoria (como la figura de Rey diferida) y los test que evaluan atencion y concentracion (como el test de los digitos). Los pacientes con que mantienen el mismo estatus tiroideo al finalizar el estudio (niveles de TSH inferiores a 10 mU/L) no presentan a nivel cognitivo diferencias clinicamente relevantes con respecto a los individuos del grupo control, ni un riesgo incrementado de desarrollar un establecido al finalizar el estudio.\nEn conclusion y aunque los pacientes diagnosticados de no describen de forma subjetiva un mayor numero de quejas o problemas de memoria que los individuos del grupo control, se constata que estos pacientes si que presentan alteraciones en los test que evaluan las funciones de atencion-ejecucion, memoria diferida y atencion-concentracion. Las puntuaciones obtenidas en el Test de depresion de Yesavage no detectan la presencia de un mayor numero de cuadros depresivos en los pacientes con hipotiroismo subclinico. El seguimiento a largo plazo de los pacientes que presentan hipotirodismo con niveles de TSH<10mU/L, no detecta alteraciones cognitivas relevantes.",

      "title": "Physical symptoms of depression: unmet needs.",
      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

      "title": "The role of centralised pain in osteoarthritis.",
      "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying chronic pain states, including osteoarthritis, differ from those underlying acute pain. In chronic pain states, central nervous system (CNS) factors often play a particularly prominent role. In many individuals with chronic pain, pain can occur with minimal or no evidence of ongoing nociceptive input. Medical subspecialties have applied a wide-range of labels to these pain conditions including fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis to name just a few. These same CNS processes can augment or magnify pain when there is ongoing nociceptive input, as in conditions such as osteoarthritis or autoimmune disorders. The hallmark of these 'centrally driven' pain conditions is a diffuse hyperalgesic state identifiable though the use of experimental sensory testing, that has been corroborated by functional neuroimaging. Characteristic symptoms of these central pain conditions include multifocal pain, fatigue, poor sleep, memory complaints and frequent co-morbid mood and anxiety disorders. In contrast to acute and peripheral pain states that are responsive to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids, central pain conditions respond best to CNS neuromodulating agents, such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and anticonvulsants. While osteoarthritis is generally considered a peripherally mediated pain state, a subset of these patients also manifests centrally driven pain characteristics. Thus, osteoarthritis can also be thought of as a \"mixed\" pain state and this requires a more tailored approach to treatment.",

      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno psiquiátrico que presenta según el DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)(1), síntomas característicos como ideas delirantes, alucinaciones, lenguaje desorganizado (por ejemplo, descarrilamiento frecuente o incoherencia), comportamiento catatónico o gravemente desorganizado, síntomas negativos, (por ejemplo, aplanamiento afectivo, alogia o abulia), que afecta principalmente a personas en edad productiva, con alto impacto en la calidad de vida del paciente y en su entorno familiar y social. En este estudio se describe el comportamiento de los factores farmacológicos y no farmacológicos que alteran la adherencia al tratamiento, de 85 pacientes con esquizofrenia, dados de alta de la Unidad de Salud Mental (USM), del Hospital Hernando Moncaleano Perdomo de Neiva (HUHMP), mediante revisión de la historia clínica y la entrevista telefónica del acudiente, familiar o del mismo paciente. La mayoría de los pacientes encuestados son adultos jóvenes, de género masculino, solteros, procedentes del departamento del Huila, con baja escolaridad, sin vinculo laboral en el momento del estudio. Se encontró un nivel bajo de adherencia al tratamiento, el cual es directamente proporcional al grado de introspección del paciente, al apoyo familiar y/o social, a la prescripción de antipsicóticos atípicos, a la buena relación médico-paciente e inversamente proporcional al consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, a la prescripción de medicamentos típicos, y a la presencia de reacciones adversas. El conocer estos comportamientos, es un precedente para futuras investigaciones y además es punto de partida para crear estrategias que permitan mejorar la tasa de adherencia al tratamiento por parte de los pacientes esquizofrénicos, desde un punto de vista integral e individualizado a la vez.",

There are data that prove the fact that patients with bipolar disorder show cognitive deficits in all stages of the disorder, but also during remission phases. Within bipolar disorder, bipolar depression occurs more frequently, lasts longer and has a higher rate of relapses than mania. Bipolar patients usually complain of cognitive deficits such as attentional or memory deficits Patients with bipolar disorder experiment during depressive episodes dysfunctions in attention (difficulties in focusing and maintaining attention), memory (deficits of declarative and nondeclarative memory, affected verbal recall and recognition), language (bradyphemia with longer moments of pause during speech), psychomotor performance (psychomotor inhibition, slowness of motor functions when the number of tasks increases), executive functions (limited ability to acquire or relearn different skills), general intellectual functioning (information processing deficits). Recent studies have made some suggestion regarding a certain degree of cognitive impairment that is also found in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. In order to have a more accurate assessment regarding the degree of cognitive dysfunctions both during depressive episodes and euthymic phases in bipolar disorder, diagnosis criteria for depression and for remission should be strictly respected and coexisting factors that may influence the results should not be taken in consideration.",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

It is rare to remember a smell or a taste from the dream. Reading and computations (arithmetic) do not frequently occur in dreams. Many dreams contain unusual amounts of emotion, and may provide greater access to older memories – -especially during late morning REM dreams. While impairment in critical self-reflective capacities may occur in dreams, it is not clear if all dreams are characterized by impairment in self-reflectiveness. The dreaming mind/brain spontaneously and automatically produces dreams in the form of narratives and likely uses cognitive operations like Freud's dreamwork to do so.",

They are common, accounting for over 10% of seizure emergencies and around 30% of cases in tertiary epilepsy units, but the diagnosis is often missed or delayed. The recently proposed “integrative cognitive model” accommodates current research on experiential, psychological and biological risk factors for the development of PNES, but in view of the considerable heterogeneity of presentations and medical context, it is not certain that a universal model can capture the full range of PNES manifestations. This narrative review addresses key learning objectives of the ILAE curriculum by describing the demographic profile, common risk factors (such as trauma or acute stress) and comorbid disorders (such as other dissociative and functional disorders, post‐traumatic stress disorder, depressive and anxiety disorders, personality disorders, comorbid epilepsy, head injury, cognitive and sleep problems, migraine, pain, and asthma). The clinical implications of demographic and aetiological factors for diagnosis and treatment planning are addressed.",

On the other hand, the other delusional disorders are usually associated with right hemisphere or bilateral lesions. The significance of mood disorders particularly in cases of frontal lobe pathology has been reported, including: depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse, panic disorder, and increased risk of suicide are frequently observed. Personality disorders are frequent in cases of brain pathology, particularly frontal lesions.

      "abstract": "Diagnosis of brain damage in concomitant craniocerebral trauma (SCI) has certain difficulties. So, in contrast to isolated TBI, with TBI, intracranial hematomas are diagnosed 2 times less often (in 8% of cases). The main medical errors in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury are associated with a disorder of consciousness of varying degrees, motor and psychomotor agitation, early resuscitation aids, which are needed by most of the patients in this group. Often, psychomotor agitation with existing damage to the skin of the head, inappropriate behavior of the patient is regarded as a brain injury. However, these symptoms are a consequence of cerebral hypoxia, caused, for example, by chest trauma or shock. Such complications of trauma as shock, fat embolism, thromboembolism, alcohol intoxication, respiratory failure, etc., play a certain role in provoking diagnostic errors and even mortality in TBI.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic neurosis is a nervous disease following injury, in which there is no demonstrable structural lesion of the nervous system. The symptoms are much like those of the common functional diseases of the nervous system, and may be spoken of as traumatic hysteria or traumatic neurasthenia. Commonly, however, we find symptoms of both of these disorders in the same patient and not rarely the clinical picture may not be that of either of them. Litigation is a frequent complication which materially affects the clinical history. It, not rarely, warps the judgment of the physician, and may doubly influence the patient, the many attendant conditions disastrously affecting his nervous system, while the money dangling over his head leads him, consciously or unconsciously, to distort his symptoms. The following cases are typical of a common form of traumatic neurosis, and a long period of observation gives special value to their study. I",

      "title": "Physiological mechanisms of neuromuscular impairment in diabetes‐related complications: Can physical exercise help prevent it?",
      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disorder that progressively induces complications, compromising daily independence. Among these, diabetic neuropathy is particularly prevalent and contributes to substantial neuromuscular impairments in both types 1 and 2 diabetes. This condition leads to structural damage affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems, resulting in a significant decline in sensorimotor functions. Alongside neuropathy, diabetic myopathy also contributes to muscle impairment and reduced motor performance, intensifying the neuromuscular decline. Diabetic neuropathy typically implicates neurogenic muscle atrophy, motoneuron loss and clustering of muscle fibres as a result of aberrant denervation-reinervation processes. These complications are associated with compromised neuromuscular junctions, where alterations occur in pre-synaptic vesicles, mitochondrial content and post-synaptic signalling. Neural damage is intensified by chronic hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress, exacerbating vascular dysfunction and reducing oxygen delivery. These complications imply a severe decline in neuromuscular performance, evidenced by reductions in maximal force and power output, rate of force development and muscle endurance. Furthermore, diabetes-related complications are compounded by age-related degenerative changes in long-term patients. Aerobic and resistance training offer promising approaches for managing blood glucose levels and neuromuscular function. Aerobic exercise promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and angiogenesis, supporting metabolic and cardiovascular health. Resistance training primarily enhances neural plasticity, muscle strength and hypertrophy, which are crucial factors for mitigating sarcopenia and preserving functional independence. This topical review examines current evidence on the physiological mechanisms underlying diabetic neuropathy and the potential impact of physical activity in counteracting this decline.",

      "title": "Blunt Force Trauma",
      "abstract": "Abstract Blunt injuries are caused by mechanical force resulting in damage to the affected tissues mainly due to compression, traction, torsion, and shear stresses. The impact is induced either by a moving blunt object hitting the body or the victim's movement against an obstacle having a hard surface. In forensic practice, injuries from blunt force are often seen after criminal assaults where they may be inflicted, for instance, by fist blows or kicking. They not only occur in physical child abuse and other kinds of domestic violence, in traffic, sports, and industrial accidents but also in falls brought about by the victims themselves for various reasons (e.g., in drunken, infirm, or sick persons or in suicides jumping from a height). On skin, blunt traumatization produces abrasions, contusions (bruises), and lacerations. In some cases, a patterned configuration helps to determine characteristic features of the causative instrument. Within the body, blunt traumatization may be followed by bone fractures and laceration/rupture of vessels and organs with concomitant blood loss and potential failure of vital functions. The article shortly describes and illustrates the most important manifestations of blunt force injuries (including head trauma) under reconstructive aspects and from the medicolegal point of view.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry has long recognized stress syndromes. The acute posttraumatic stress syndrome occurring in war is well known. Those occurring as a result of accidents in civilian life are less well known. Burnout is a recently described addition to this group of illnesses. The stress that is etiologic differs in many ways from that found in the acute syndromes. The stress that causes burnout is chronic, and is either self-imposed or inherent in a work situation. The illness responds to rest or removal from the work situation, but restructuring of the person's motivations and relationships is necessary if the person is to remain symptom free.",

      "abstract": "There was little to no clinical supervision in the use of neuroleptic or antidepressant medications, and one got the impression that they were considered sedatives with a non-specific effect of quieting the patient while psychotherapy commenced. Major variables that will be decisive also include the agreed-upon goals of treatment. The purpose in removing symptoms may include trying to prevent suicide, restoring work and interpersonal function, or enhancing the patient's capacity to participate in psychotherapy. The patient was in an agitated state, overwhelmed by fearful ruminations to the degree that he could not think clearly, or concentrate on anything including his psychotherapy, and had developed early waking insomnia. Many who need psychotherapy will be denied it to avoid short-term cost. Psychiatrists need to be trained to a point of expertise in diagnosis and, psychopharmacotherapy, and in several psychotherapeutic modes.",
