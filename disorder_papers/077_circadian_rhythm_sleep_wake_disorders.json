      "title": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are a group of disorders in which the individual's sleep is misaligned with the normal sleep and wake times. This is due to lack of synchrony between the body circadian clock timekeeping mechanism and the 24-hour day-night cycle. Some of the disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder, advanced sleep phase disorder, free running disorder, and irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder are due to abnormalities in the circadian clock timekeeping mechanism. There are other disorders such as shift work disorder and jet lag disorder in which the circadian clock timekeeping mechanism is normal but the problems arise due to mismatch caused by extrinsic factors (night or early morning shift work and air travel across multiple time zones). Proper recognition and treatment of these disorders are necessary to ameliorate the symptoms and minimize the adverse social and occupational impact.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Circadian mechanisms and the sleep-wakefulness rhythms guarantee survival, adaptation, efficient action in everyday life or in emergencies and well-being. Disordered circadian processes at central and/or cellular levels, sleep disorders, and unhealthy wakefulness/sleep rhythms can impair the physiological circadian organization and result in subjective, professional, or behavioral changes ranging from functional inadequacy to higher risks at work or on the road to medical relevance. Circadian rhythms and the sleep organization change ontogenetically; major changes result from normal aging and from the multiple diseases that are often associated. There are circular functional interactions involving sleep/sleep disorders, the autonomic and immune systems, and the functional changes in the circadian system due to aging that deserve attention but have been overlooked thus far.",

      "abstract": "The circadian rhythm sleep disorders define the clinical conditions where sleep–wake rhythm is disrupted despite optimum environmental and social conditions. They occur as a result of the changes in endogenous circadian hours or non-compatibility of environmental factors or social life with endogenous circadian rhythm. The sleep–wake rhythm is disrupted continuously or in repeating phases depending on lack of balance between internal and external cycles. This condition leads to functional impairments which cause insomnia, excessive sleepiness or both in people. Application of detailed sleep anamnesis and sleep diary with actigraphy record, if possible, will be sufficient for diagnosis. The treatment aims to align endogenous circadian rhythm with environmental conditions. The purpose of this article is to review pathology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis and treatment of circadian rhythm disorder.",

      "abstract": "Simply stated, everyday people should strive to fall asleep at the time when they are sleepiest. For most people this means having the major sleep period start in the evening and conclude at dawn. However, situations arise in which a person's sleep timing, or circadian rhythm of sleep, is not synchronized with other factors, potentially leading to sleep quality problems. The term circadian refers to a circuit or period that is about 24 hours long. Many physiological, biochemical, and behavioral activities have a circadian rhythm, with the sleep-wake cycle being the most easily recognized. The sleep-wake cycle is related to other circadian rhythms, such as core body temperature and concentrations of melatonin or cortisol, through a complex interaction of signals.",

      "title": "A possible link between circadian rhythm disorders and mood disorders",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm disorders are problems with your circadian rhythm, the internal body that keeps your biological processes in step. This cycle lasts about 24 hours. The term circadian comes from Latin words that mean “around the day.” Patterns of brain waves, hormone production, cell regrowth, and other activities are linked to this cycle. Your circadian rhythm plays a key role in things like when you sleep and when you wake. Your normal circadian clock is set by the cycle of light and dark over 24 hours. People with circadian rhythm disorders may have problems: Falling asleep, Staying asleep, Waking up too early and not being able to go back to sleep, Getting sleep but not feeling refreshed by it. Things that can cause circadian rhythm disorders include Shift work, Pregnancy, Time zone changes, Medications, Changes in routine, such as staying up late or sleeping in, Medical problems including Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, Mental health problems, Menopause. Various Circadian Rhythm Disorders include Jet lag, or rapid time zone change syndrome: This involves symptoms like too much sleepiness and a lack of daytime alertness in people who travel across time zones. It gets worse with each time zone crossed, especially when traveling toward the east. Shift work sleep disorder: This sleep disorder affects people who frequently rotate shifts or work at night. A conflict between someone’s circadian rhythm and the time of their shift can mean they get up to 4 hours less sleep than the average person. Delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS): This is a disorder of sleep timing. People with DSPS tend to fall asleep very late at night and have a hard time waking up in time for work, school, or social activities. It’s especially common in teens and young adults. Advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS): This is a disorder in which a person goes to sleep earlier and wakes earlier than they wanted. For example, they might fall asleep between 6 and 9 p.m. and wake up between 1 and 5 a.m. Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder: This disorder often affects people who are blind because the circadian clock is set by the light-dark cycle. With this condition, that cycle is disturbed. It can cause a serious lack of sleep time and quality at night and sleepiness during daylight hours. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder: With this disorder, people’s circadian rhythms are jumbled. They may sleep in a series of naps over 24 hours. Seasonal affective disorder and all the circadian rhythm disorders are related to a discrepancy between the duration of the solar day and the circadian cycle. The circadian cycle of humans and other mammals is close to one hour longer than the 24 hours period from sunrise to sunrise. Interestingly, birds show a circadian cycle of less than 24 hours and close to 23 hours. Terrestrial invertebrates, the insects provide the key to understanding this discrepancy. The earliest identifiably mammalian fossils are from the Permian era strata. Insect orders that first appeared in the Permian era include the Hemiptera (bugs), Orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers), Coleoptera (beetles) and the Neuroptera (lacewings). All of whose modern survivors show a circadian cycle longer than 24 hours in at least some stage of the life cycle. The insects whose ancestors first appeared in Mesozoic strata with the birds include Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Their modern survivors, like the birds, demonstrate a circadian rhythm shorter than 24 hours. It is proposed here that the duration of these animal classes circadian day may reflect the duration of the solar day at the time of their origin. There is now evidence for three large meteorite impacts on Pangea near the end of the Permian era, one in Wilkes Land of Antarctica, one near the Falkland Islands, and one just west of Australia. The eastward movement of the Australian, African, and Eurasian continent/plate and the southeastward movement of the Antarctic continents/plates suggest that those meteorites were moving eastwards and struck the planet obliquely. Having done so, they might have imparted momentum to the planet’s rotation and so accelerated it. This may mean that circadian rhythm disorders are the consequence of a change in the duration of the solar day due to a disaster and that daytime lethargy and depression may have had adaptive value to the mammals who survived that disaster. If this is true, it adds context to our treatment of these disorders with bright light and melatonin",

Yet, excessive daytime sleepiness is not only common, and it often goes unrecognized. It can contribute to accidents, produce or exacerbate health conditions, reduce efficiency and productivity, interfere with social relationships, and diminish quality of life. The spectrum of common sleep disorders includes circadian rhythm changes, shiftwork requirements, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, also known as insomnia. In many cases, however, sleep deprivation is the choice of the patient, chosen in response to long commutes, academic rigor, or occupational matters. Regardless of the sleep disorder that a patient has, good sleep behavior or \"sleep hygiene\" is essential.",

      "abstract": "It is estimated that 15 to 25% of the U.S. labor force works night, evening, or rotating shifts. These non-traditional schedules can affect the circadian rhythm, a self-sustained rhythm of biological processes that plays an important role in modulating sleep/wake function, resulting in circadian rhythm sleep disorder, shift work type, usually referred to as shift work disorder. The disorder consists of a constant or recurrent pattern of sleep interruption that results in insomnia when sleep is needed and excessive sleepiness during waking hours. Clinicians need more information about the role of the circadian rhythm in human functioning as well as the pathophysiology, prevalence, and consequences of shift work disorder, so that they can recognize and diagnose this problem in clinical practice.",

Insomnia is associated with a disturbance in one or more of the three systems that regulate sleep: homeostatic, circadian and arousal. A disturbance may result from genetic/dispositional issues, from acute life events, from habitual behaviors and attitudes, or from any combination of these three types of issues. A number of treatment methods have been developed that use behavior modification and cognitive restructuring to facilitate homeostatic and circadian mechanisms of sleep, and to reduce arousal during bedtime. These methods actively engage the patient to implement life style changes, attitudes and beliefs that promote sleep.",

The SCN aligns whole-body cellular, behavioral and phenomenological processes with the Earth’s 24-hour day/night rhythm. When disruptions to the SCN’s perceptual system occur (e.g., “jet-lag,” prolonged waking, chronic exposure to light at night or habit change as the result of becoming a parent), disrupted melatonin and glucocorticoid secretion can lead to widespread dysregulation of sleep and circadian cycling. The effects of circadian disruptions are often compounded by the homeostatic sleep drive, wherein sleep pressure accumulates with protracted wakefulness to affect mood, cognition, health and well-being.",

      "title": "The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders Leon C. Lack1* 1 Flinders University, Australia Sleepiness is determined biologically by two comparable but independent factors: homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm sleep drive. The circadian sleepiness varies with a host of synchronised endogenous physiological and hormonal rhythms across the 24-hour period. Normal entrainment of this circadian system favours sleep at night (aprox. 2300-0700h) and alertness/productivity during the day. However, abnormalities of the circadian system in timing or amplitude can cause chronic or short term difficulties sleeping when desired and being alert when necessary. Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) results from a 2-6 hour delay from normal of the circadian system making it impossible to initiate sleep before 0100h. Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) results from an abnormally early timed circadian system making it impossible to maintain sleep past 0300h. Free-running rhythms do not remain stable in the 24-hour period but tend to drift later making night-time sleep and daytime alertness difficult for periods of days or weeks. Jet-lag and shiftwork usually produce short-lived sleep/wake problems. Since the most common disorders are from abnormal timing of the circadian system, tools to re-time circadian rhythms such as retinal light stimulation and exogenous melatonin administration can be used to treat these disorders. Light intensity, duration, and wavelength are important dimensions for treatment effect. However, the timing of light is critical for the effectiveness of these treatments. Bright light stimulation pushes the endogenous sleep period away from it like similar poles on a bar magnet (e.g. south/south) while the time of melatonin administration pulls the endogenous sleep period towards it like two opposite magnetic poles (e.g. north/south). The ‘push’ and ‘pull’ effects can be combined to shepherd the endogenous sleep period into the desired time (e.g. 2300-0700h). Other behavioural procedures and cognitive therapies can also be helpful in the treatment of these problematic circadian rhythm disorders.

      "abstract": "Abstract Circadian rhythms define the near-24-hour oscillations observed in physiological processes. Circadian rhythm disorders result when there is a misalignment between an individual’s physiological rhythm and the environment. This can result from an intrinsic inability to entrain with the external environment, or from environmental demands that force desynchrony (e.g., shift work). This chapter will provide an overview of the currently recognized circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders: delayed sleep–wake phase disorder, advanced sleep–wake phase disorder, irregular sleep–wake rhythm disorder, non-24-hour sleep–wake rhythm disorder, shift work disorder, and jet lag disorder. The chapter also provides a discussion of current treatment recommendations.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a widespread disorder affecting not only sleep quantity and quality, but also daytime well-being and performance, as well as having a negative impact on physical and mental health. Many people have problems falling asleep and maintaining sleep that do not reach the clinical criteria of insomnia. For all the prevalence of such sleep disorders, specialists often overlook a fundamentally important factor that affects sleep and wakefulness cycle, ease of falling asleep and daytime performance. These are circadian rhythms of the body under the control of the biological clock.This review highlights the specifics of the human biological clock and its relationship to insomnia and complaints of poor sleep. The phenomenon of the human chronotype as a set of individual preferences in sleep-wake rhythm is considered. Late chronotype, tat tends to wake up late and be active in the evening turns out to be the most vulnerable to the appearance of complaints of poor sleep and development of insomnia. This result is typical for different age groups. The reason for problems sleep for the late chronotype is the need to adjust to social demands and to fall asleep and wake up too early relative to the phase of one’s own circadian rhythm.Circadian rhythms may contribute to the formation and maintenance of insomnia. Both chronic and acute insomnia may have a chronobiological component that is not always considered. Late chronotype may be a factor further exacerbating the course of insomnia. The regularity of circadian rhythms may also be impaired in insomnia.The importance of the biological clock in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness also explains the successful approach to insomnia treatment with melatonin, which plays an important signaling role in the circadian regulation of the body.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a natural phenomenon of giving adequate rest to the body and mind. Insomnia is the inability to fall asleep at night for many hours or inability to have a sound sleep, which deprives one of natural rest and interferes with activities during the day. Each of us has suffered a restless night at some point in our lives. We’ve all occasionally sacrificed sleep for a cram session before an exam, or an important deadline. Many of us also know the feeling of losing sleep due to an intense emotional upset or the accumulation of stress or anxiety. For some of us, loss of sleep is short-lived; for others, it is chronic and we’ve come to anticipate losing sleep on a regular basis. Insomnia can be caused by elevated or chronic stress, illness, physical discomfort, environmental factors, changes in our schedules, side effects from prescribed medications, depression, anxiety, and…",

      "abstract": "The circadian system is synchronized to the light-dark cycle generated by the rotation of the earth, ensuring that wake¬fulness is during the day and sleep occurs at night. However, the sleep-wake rhythm may be out of sync with the light-dark cycle or endogenously out of sync, resulting in insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in activities of daily living. Sleep disorders are classified by the American Sleep Disorders Association, as intrinsic dyssomnias, extrinsic dyssomnias, parasomnias, or medical/psychiatric sleep disorders. Circa¬dian sleep disorders have been categorized separately to recognize that in most cases the etiology of circadian dis¬turbances is a mix of internal and environmental factors or a temporary mismatch between the two. Symptoms are usually insomnia or hypersomnia, common symptoms in patients with circadian sleep disorders although other causes can be attributed and must be excluded before a diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder is made. In the patient without other sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool in assessing circadian sleep disorders. These records should be kept for 2 weeks or more, as a disturbance due to job changes or travel across time zones can have effects on sleep and daytime alertness weeks after the event.

      "title": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep–Wake Disorders I",
      "abstract": "Abstract Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is debilitating and the most common circadian rhythm disorder. It is defined as having a sleep pattern delayed by at least 2–3 hours from conventional timing, with great difficulty sleeping at conventional sleep times despite the frequent desire to do so. It is assumed to be caused by a delay of the endogenous circadian rhythm. Although it has its own diagnostic criteria, it lies on a continuum spanning from intermediate to moderate and extreme evening chronotypes to DSWPD and to non-24-hour phase disorder. This continuum is mainly driven by endogenous circadian period length varying from just over 24 hours to an extreme of 25 hours. Behavioral, psychological, and societal variables also contribute to the difficulty adhering to conventional sleep times. The recent novel findings of many DSWPD patients who do not have a substantial circadian rhythm delay suggest the contribution of non-circadian factors to the intransigence of a late timed sleep period; there is considerable evidence of the association of mental and physical health risks with the apparent inability to synchronize with the earth’s 24-hour period of rotation. Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder is defined as having a sleep pattern timed earlier than desired or conventional. Attempts to delay bedtime to a more conventional time are difficult and result in reduced total sleep time since wake times remain early. This condition is relatively rare, affecting 0.0%–0.33% of the population, and infrequently presents for treatment.",

      "abstract": "Rhythmicity of the circadian system is a 24-hour period, driven by transcription-translation feedback loops of circadian clock genes.The central circadian pacemaker in mammals is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which controls peripheral circadian clocks.In general, most physiological processes are regulated by the circadian system, which is modulated by environmental cues such as exposure to light and/or dark, temperature, and the timing of sleep/wake and food intake.The chronic circadian disruption caused by shift work, jetlag, and/or irregular sleep-wake cycles has long-term health consequences.Its dysregulation contributes to the risk of psychiatric disorders, sleep abnormalities, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, cancer, and obesity.A number of neurological conditions may be worsened by changes in the circadian clock via the SCN pacemaker.For stroke, different physiological activities such as sleep/wake cycles are disrupted due to alterations in circadian rhythms.Moreover, the immunological processes that affect the evolution and recovery processes of stroke are regulated by the circadian clock or core-clock genes.Thus, disrupted circadian rhythms may increase the severity and consequences of stroke, while readjustment of circadian clock machinery may accelerate recovery from stroke.In this manuscript, we discuss the relationship between stroke and circadian rhythms, particularly on stroke development and its recovery process.We focus on immunological and/or molecular processes linking stroke and the circadian system and suggest the circadian rhythm as a target for designing effective therapeutic strategies in stroke.",

The misalignment between the internal circadian timing system and the external environment is typically due to either an alteration in the functioning of the circadian timing system (e.g., delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome) or to changes in the external environment (e.g., jet lag). However, the clinical presentation of most of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is influenced by a combination of physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. These disorders lead to complaints of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, with impairment in important areas of functioning and quality of life. Current treatments primarily involve the use of circadian synchronizing agents, such as light, to realign the internal and external environment. These treatments are limited by the availability of adequate diagnostic tools and well-controlled clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders is required to develop more effective treatments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human behavioral and physiological processes are under the dual control of circadian rhythmicity and sleep‐wake homeostasis. In mammalian species, the underlying mechanism for the generation of most circadian rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Sleep‐wake homeostasis is an hourglass‐like mechanism relating sleep propensity and intensity to the duration of prior wakefulness. Studies under “constant routine conditions” have facilitated the detection of circadian and sleep regulation and have delineated the temporal variations over the 24‐hr day of subjective alertness (or its antonym, subjective sleepiness), cognitive performance (i.e. objective alertness), and mood, as well as endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular function. Subjective and objective alertness vary in parallel, with detectable decreases starting around the usual bedtime until a minimum is reached in the early morning hours, and then increase during the daytime hours. Decreased sleep quality and sleep loss due to voluntary behavioral alterations or to pathological conditions are associated with disturbances of a variety of neurobehavioral, physiological parameters, as well as of subjective alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. Aging is commonly associated with pronounced alterations of both the homeostatic process and the circadian pacemaker. Strategies to improve sleep quality may have beneficial effects on mental and physical well‐being.",

      "abstract": "Approximately one third of our lives are spent in sleeping.Although largely an enigma, sleep is an important component of human behavior and provides an emotional and physical restoration to the body.Abnormalities in the normal physiology of sleep often cause a sleep complaint (e.g., difficulty falling asleep) or result in a sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea, narcolepsy).The prevalence of sleep difficulties in the general population is estimated to be 30% to 35%.Sleep is complex psycho-physiologic phenomenon that can be documented in sleep laboratory studies.During sleep the brain is extremely active and produces a characteristic pattern of stages, that cycle during the night.There is a wide inter-individual variability in the amount of sleep required per night (i.e., 3 to 10 hours.)A circadian rhythm of sleep and walking is established shortly after birth and changes over the life cycle.A deceleration of the 24 cycle occurs during adolescence and is typified by difficulty falling asleep.The rhythm returns to 24 hours during adulthood and accelerates with increasing age.Thus elderly individuals commonly complain of falling asleep early in the evening and waking early in the morning.Two oscillators with different period lengths control the suprachiasmic nucleus and the other occurs through neurobiologic mechanism.Two peptides, δ-sleep inducing peptide and factor S appear to be involved in the biochemical regulation.Synchronization of the oscillators with the 24-hour cycle imposed by the earth's rotation requires a routinely occurring zeitgeber (e.g., clock, light, shower, breakfast) to set the internal clock.Practically, young person should awaken at the same time daily to shorten the oscillators, and elderly persons should delay the onset of sleep until a set time to stretch the oscillators.The neurotransmitter norepinephrine is involved in wakefulness and dreaming, while serotonin is active during non-dreaming sleep.The interaction between the cholinergic system and the noradrenergic system also may play a role in sleep.The pharmacological treatment of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are updated through this review article.",

      "abstract": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep DisordersCircadian rhythm sleep disorders all involve a problem in the timing of when a person sleeps and is awake.The human body has a master circadian clock in a control center of the brain known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).This internal clock regulates the timing of such body rhythms as temperature and hormone levels.The primary circadian rhythm that this body clock controls is the sleep-wake cycle.The circadian clock functions in a cycle that lasts a little longer than 24 hours.The circadian clock is \"set\" primarily by visual cues of light and darkness that are communicated along a pathway from the eyes to the SCN.This keeps the clock synchronized to the 24-hour day.Other time cues, know as zeitgebers, also can influence the clock's timing.These cues include meal and exercise schedules.Circadian rhythms and their sensitivity to time cues may change as a person ages.Each circadian rhythm sleep disorder involves one of these two problems:• You have a hard time initiating sleep.• You struggle to maintain sleep, waking up frequently during the night.• You tend to wake up too early and are unable to go back to sleep.• You sleep is nonrestorative or of poor quality. Types of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders• Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSP): DSP occurs when a person regularly goes to sleep and wakes up more than two hours later than is considered normal.People with DSP tend to be \"evening types\" who typically stay awake until 1 a.m. or later and wake-up in the late morning or afternoon.If able to go to bed at the preferred late time on a regular basis, a person with DSP will have a very stable sleep pattern.DPS is more common among adolescents and young adults with a reported prevalence of 7-16%.It is estimated that DPS is seen in approximately 10% of patients with chronic insomnia in sleep clinics.A positive family history may be present in approximately 40% of individuals with DPS.",

The major sleep disorders discussed in this chapter are insomnia (characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality), hypersomnia or hypersomnolence (characterized by excessive sleepiness), narcolepsy (caused by loss of orexin neurones in the central nervous system (CNS), mutations in orexin receptors or deficits in the synthesis of orexin and characterized by an urge to sleep) and cataplexy (typified by bilateral weakness of the skeletal muscles). Sleep disorders are divided into two general categories, dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias are disorders where there are problems falling asleep, staying asleep or of excessive sleepiness; they are characterized by irregularities in the timing, quantity and quality of sleep. Parasomnias are disorders about sleep–wake transitions and are characterized by strange or abnormal behaviours, incidents or experiences that occur during sleep.",

One cause of insomnia that is often overlooked results from a conflict in schedules and desynchronization between the intrinsic sleep-wake propensity of a person and his or her 24-hour physical and social environment. Sleep propensity is governed by the complex interactions of an oscillating circadian rhythm and a monotonous homeostatic process. This review describes the basic physiology of the circadian system and, based on these understandings, discusses the various clinical manifestations of and treatments for circadian rhythm sleep disorders.",

Patients with disturbances of circadian rhythm find themselves unable to shift their sleep/wake cycle to adapt to the schedule requirements of work, school, and/or family life. In delayed sleep phase syndrome, patients may experience “sleep drunkenness” upon awakening, with confusion, disorientation, and impaired motor coordination. Generally individuals suffer with disturbances of circadian rhythm for years before getting treatment. Treatment approaches often involve a carefully planned, gradual shifting of sleep time and the use of melatonin as well as the bright light therapy that are timed carefully, depending on the clinical situation. The control of the sleep/wake cycle is complex. It is affected by the genetic factors, maintained by neurologic and hormonal systems, and responsive to external stimuli.",

One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Alterations of Circadian Rhythmicity and Sleep in Aging: Endocrine Consequences",
      "abstract": "All 24-hour endocrine rhythms partially reflect the interaction of circadian rhythmicity with sleep-wake homeostasis but their relative contributions vary from one system to another. In older adults, many 24-hour rhythms are dampened and/or advanced, including those of cortisol and GH. Amplitude reduction and phase advance of 24-hour rhythms may represent age-related changes in the central nervous systems underlying circadian rhythmicity and sleep-wake homeostasis. Age-related alterations in circadian function could also reflect decreased exposure and/or responsivity to the synchronizing effects of both photic (e.g. light exposure) and nonphotic (e.g. social cues) inputs. There are pronounced age-related alterations in sleep quality in aging which consist primarily of a marked reduction of slow-wave sleep, a reduction in REM stages and a marked increase in the number and duration of awakenings interrupting sleep. Alterations in slow-wave sleep occur abruptly in young adulthood (30–40 years of age) whereas disturbances in amounts of REM and wake appear more gradually. This article reviews evidence indicating that deficits in characteristics of sleep-wake homeostasis and circadian function may mediate age-related alterations in somatotropic and corticotropic function. Because sleep loss in young subjects results in endocrine disturbances which mimic those observed in aging, it is conceivable that the decrease in sleep quality which characterizes aging may contribute to age-related alterations in hormonal function and their metabolic consequences.",

      "abstract": "Any systemic or neurological condition can cause sleep disruption. Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep.

      "title": "Sleep and Quality of Life in REM Sleep Parasomnia",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are abnormal behavioral or physiological events that intrude into the sleep process disrupting its continuity. Parasomnia associated to REM sleep include REM sleep behavior disorder, nightmare disorders, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (SP), and sleep-related painful erections. The quality of life of patients suffering from parasomnias may vary according to the disorder. REM sleep behavior disorder patients experience recurrent vivid and violent dreams and frequent sleep-related injuries for themselves or bed partners, with possible impacts on personal, couple, and social life. Despite the possible awakening from REM sleep, sleep architecture is usually preserved in RBD. Idiopathic RBD may often precede a neurodegenerative disease, and its diagnosis might imply a psychological burden for patients and their family. The increased risk for neurodegenerative illnesses poses the ethical dilemma whether the patient should or should not be told about, especially in view of the current lack of effective neuroprotective strategies and the lack of knowledge about the precise extent of this risk. Nightmares are intensely disturbing dreams involving a variety of dysphoric emotions, most often fear and anxiety. Nightmares have been correlated to various measures of psychopathology, namely neuroticism, anxiety, depression, but not all studies support this relationship. Personality factors, such as nightmare frequency, nightmare distress (ND), and coping style, appear to be important in modulating the clinical severity of nightmare disorder. Parasomnias, especially nightmare and SP, can lead to postawakening anxiety with difficulty returning to sleep, sleep avoidance, and sleep deprivation, with subsequent insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and intensification of the parasomnia REM-rebound related.",

      "title": "Disrupted Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Schizophrenia and Their Interaction With Dopamine Signaling",
      "abstract": "Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is a common feature of schizophrenia, and is associated with symptom severity and patient quality of life. It is commonly manifested as disturbances to the sleep/wake cycle, with sleep abnormalities occurring in up to 80% of patients, making it one of the most common symptoms of this disorder. Severe circadian misalignment has also been reported, including non-24 h periods and phase advances and delays. In parallel, there are alterations to physiological circadian parameters such as body temperature and rhythmic hormone production. At the molecular level, alterations in the rhythmic expression of core clock genes indicate a dysfunctional circadian clock. Furthermore, genetic association studies have demonstrated that mutations in several clock genes are associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia. Collectively, the evidence strongly suggests that sleep and circadian disruption is not only a symptom of schizophrenia but also plays an important causal role in this disorder. The alterations in dopamine signaling that occur in schizophrenia are likely to be central to this role. Dopamine is well-documented to be involved in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle, in which it acts to promote wakefulness, such that elevated dopamine levels can disturb sleep. There is also evidence for the influence of dopamine on the circadian clock, such as through entrainment of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), and dopamine signaling itself is under circadian control. Therefore dopamine is closely linked with sleep and the circadian system; it appears that they have a complex, bidirectional relationship in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, such that disturbances to one exacerbate abnormalities in the other. This review will provide an overview of the evidence for a role of SCRD in schizophrenia, and examine the interplay of this with altered dopamine signaling. We will assess the evidence to suggest common underlying mechanisms in the regulation of sleep/circadian rhythms and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Improvements in sleep are associated with improvements in symptoms, along with quality of life measures such as cognitive ability and employability. Therefore the circadian system holds valuable potential as a new therapeutic target for this disorder.",

      "title": "Mood variation under dual regulation of circadian clock and light",
      "abstract": "The intricate relationship between circadian rhythms and mood is well-established. Disturbances in circadian rhythms and sleep often precede the development of mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Two primary factors, intrinsic circadian clocks and light, drive the natural fluctuations in mood throughout the day, mirroring the patterns of sleepiness and wakefulness. Nearly all organisms possess intrinsic circadian clocks that coordinate daily rhythms, with light serving as the primary environmental cue to synchronize these internal timekeepers with the 24-hour cycle. Additionally, light directly influences mood states. Disruptions to circadian rhythms, such as those caused by jet lag, shift work, or reduced daylight hours, can trigger or exacerbate mood symptoms. The complex and often subtle connections between circadian disruptions and mood dysregulation suggest that focusing solely on individual clock genes is insufficient to fully understand their etiology and progression. Instead, mood instability may arise from systemic misalignments between external cycles and the internal synchronization of circadian clocks. Here, we synthesize past research on the independent contributions of circadian clocks and light to mood regulation, drawing particularly on insights from animal studies that illuminate fundamental mechanisms relevant to human health.",

      "abstract": "In modern society, more and more people work during ‘non-standard’ working hours, including shift and night work, which are recognized risk factors for health, safety and social well-being. Unfortunately, humans are physiologically unsuited to inverted schedules, leading to negative consequences for shift workers, employers, and society. The circadian and homeostatic processes which govern sleepiness and alertness are improperly aligned for night workers. Shiftwork, in particular night work, causes disruption of biological rhythms, perturbation of social and family life, with a negative influence on performance efficiency and health. Deterioration of health can manifest in the short-term as sleep disorders and accidents; in the long term there is an increased risk of gastrointestinal, psychoneurotic and cardiovascular diseases, and impairment of the female reproductive function. Night work and rotating shift work disrupt the circadian timing system. This disruption may produce significant deleterious symptoms ¡n some workers. Shift-work scheduling may aggravate certain medical conditions. Vulnerable individuals may develop clinical depression when working shifts.",

      "title": "Stress and insomnia – A vicious circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterised by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school and social settings. The common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood, irritability, general discomfort and cognitive difficulties. On the other hand, stress results from emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can make a person feel frustrated, angry or anxious. Stress is the body’s response to a challenge or demand, accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stress depends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual’s characteristics, their neuroendocrine system and the combination of these elements, collectively determining how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include cognitive behavioural therapy, improving sleep hygiene and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than address its underlying cause. In the context of homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual’s unique structure, composition, nature and physical makeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualise each case and administer a simillimum remedy, the remedy most likely to restore health, and achieve complete healing according to homoeopathic principles. This review explores the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur due to the interplay between stress and the development of insomnia.",

Obstructive Sleep Apnoea is the most frequent respiratory sleep disorder. It involves repeated episodes of total (apnoea) or partial (hypopnea) obstruction at night. RLS or Willis-Ekbom disease is a relatively common pathology, with a prevalence of around 2.7%. It is underdiagnosed, which has a negative impact on both the quality of sleep and the patient's life. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are caused by desynchronization of the sleep/wake rhythm with the light/darkness cycle, generating an unbalanced sleep cycle. REM sleep behaviour disorder is characterised by abnormal repetitive behaviours, such as sleep-related vocalization and complex motor behaviours (intense and violent) during REM sleep, which can cause injuries or sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Circadian fluctuations in physiological setpoints are determined by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) which exerts control over many target structures within and beyond the hypothalamus via projections. The SCN, or central pacemaker, orchestrates synchrony between the external environment and the internal circadian mechanism. The resulting cycles in hormone levels and autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity provide precise messages to specific organs, adjusting, for example, their sensitivity to approaching hormones or metabolites. The SCN responds to both photic (light) and non-photic input. Circadian patterns are found in both heart rate and blood pressure, which are linked to daily variations in activity and autonomic nervous system activity. Variations in blood pressure are of great interest as several cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, arrhythmias, and hypertension are linked to circadian rhythm dysregulation. The disruption of normal day-night cycles, such as in shift work, social jetlag, or eating outside of normal hours leads to desynchronization of the central and peripheral clocks. This desynchronization leads to disorganization of the cellular processes that are normally driven by the interactions of the SCN and photic input. Here, we review autonomic system function and dysfunction due to regulation and interaction between different cardiorespiratory brain centers and the SCN, as well as social, lifestyle, and external factors that may impact the circadian control of blood pressure.",

      "abstract": "Endogenous circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior are ubiquitous among mammals and are regulated by a master circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. These intrinsic circadian rhythms are synchronized by light, melatonin, and social or physical activity to the 24-hour external light and dark cycles. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD) occur when there is an alteration of the internal circadian timing mechanisms or a misalignment between the timing of sleep and the 24-hour social and physical environments. CRSDs, such as delayed sleep phase, advanced sleep phase and shift work sleep disorder, are often under-recognized, yet should be considered in the differential of patients presenting with symptoms of insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Because behavioral and environmental factors often are involved in the development and maintenance of these disorders, a multimodal treatment approach that combines behavioral and/or pharmacologic approaches is usually required. In addition to good sleep habits, timed exposure to bright light and melatonin can be used for the treatment of CRSD. Rapid advances in understanding the physiologic, cellular, and molecular basis of circadian rhythm and sleep regulation will likely lead to improved diagnostic tools and treatments for CRSDs.",

      "abstract": "Advanced and delayed sleep phase disorders, and the hypersomnia that can accompany winter depression, have been treated successfully by appropriately timed artificial bright light exposure. Under entrainment to the 24-h day-night cycle, the sleep-wake pattern may assume various phase relationships to the circadian pacemaker, as indexed, for example, by abnormally long or short intervals between the onset of melatonin production or the core body temperature minimum and wake-up time. Advanced and delayed sleep phase syndromes and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome have been variously ascribed to abnormal intrinsic circadian periodicity, deficiency of the entrainment mechanism, or—most simply—patterns of daily light exposure insufficient for adequate phase resetting. The timing of sleep is influenced by underlying circadian phase, but psychosocial constraints also play a major role. Exposure to light early or late in the subjective night has been used therapeutically to produce corrective phase delays or advances, respectively, in both the sleep pattern and circadian rhythms. Supplemental light exposure in fall and winter can reduce the hypersomnia of winter depression, although the therapeutic effect may be less dependent on timing.",

Researchers report decrements in sustained performance as a function of fatigue, especially during and following one or more nights of complete sleep loss, or longer periods of reduced or fragmented sleep. Sleep loss appears to result in reduced reaction time, decreased vigilance, perceptual and cognitive distortions, and changes in affect. Sleep loss and workload interact with circadian rhythms in producing their effects. These interactions are a major source of stress in work situations requiring sustained work in continuous operations and have implications for theoretical models of sustained perceptual and cognitive functioning.

Shift work or air travel leads to an artificial mismatch between the endogenous circadian clock and the external environment (“extrinsic disorders”) leading to shift work disorder and jet lag disorder. Individuals with circadian rhythm sleep disorders are presented with insomnia or excessive sleepiness or both. These disorders are under recognized in the general population but they can affect a significant number of people if a the large number of shift workers and air travelers are considered. The symptoms may be misdiagnosed for other common sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or insomnia. Meticulous history and sleep diary data are integral tools in diagnosing CRSD.

If this analogy is relevant to the pathophysiology of depressive illness, advancing the time of sleep and awakening should temporarily compensate for the abnormal timing of depressed patients' circadian rhythms. Four of seven manic-depressive patients studied longitudinally spontaneously advanced their times of awakening (activity onset) as they emerged from the depressive phase of their illness. In a phase-shift experiment, a depressed manic-depressive woman was twice brought out of depression for 2 weeks by advancing her sleep period so that she went to sleep and arose 6 hours earlier than usual. The antidepressant effect of the procedure was temporary and similar in duration to circadian desynchronization induced by jet lag in healthy subjects. This result supports the hypothesis that abnormalities of sleep patterns in some types of depression are due to abnormal internal phase relationships of circadian rhythms.",

      "abstract": "Human sleep alternates between periods of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Sleep and wakefulness are modulated by homeostatic and circadian regulatory mechanisms. Like most physiological systems, sleep and wakefulness are also governed by a circadian oscillator located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Patients with sleep disorders often benefit from a general medical evaluation to investigate contributing factors. Fatigue and sleepiness may be associated with endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism. The major symptom of Insomnia Disorder is dissatisfaction with the quantity or quality of sleep. Insomnia is associated with a wide variety of medical disorders, including pulmonary, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorder. Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders (BRSD) encompasses three entities: Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea (OSAH), Central Sleep Apnea (CSA), and Sleep-Related Hypoventilation (SRH).",

Deprivation studies are one of the ways used to examine the physiological functions and the regulation of the sleep. Sleep deprivation is a stressor, and its’ effects depend on an individual’s prior sleep deficit and distribution during the day. Sleep deprivation can be partial, total, acute, or chronic or specifically focused on one of the sleep phases. Sleep deprivation affects a large spectrum of vital systems such as thermoregulation, energy and mineral balance, and immunofunction. Based on the fact that sleep is a very important process for the normal development of many metabolic pathways, it is logical to think that insomnia has serious organism consequences. Functional irregularities of different organs are always reflected in structural changes that can be identified with imaging techniques. Imaging methods can also help identify problems of animals insomnia.",

Normal sleep is characterized by behavioral and physiologic changes as well as 2 distinct sleep states, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM). Throughout the course of a night, people cycle between NREM and REM sleep via an ultradian rhythm, with most of sleep spent in NREM. Determinants involved in the regulation of sleep are the homeostatic and circadian processes. Despite being highly regulated, sleep is fragile, and its stages and duration may be affected by multiple factors, such as age, drugs, temperature, and medical and psychiatric disease.

Each of these states is composed of a number of physiologic variables generated in a variety of neural structures. The predictable oscillations of these states are driven by presumed neural pacemakers which are entrained to the 24 h geophysical environment by the light/dark cycle. Experiments in nature have indicated that wake/sleep rhythm perturbations may occur either involving desynchronization of the basic 24 h wake/sleep cycle within the geophysical 24 h cycle (circadian rhythm disturbances) or involving the rapid oscillation or incomplete declaration of state (such as narcolepsy). The use of phase spaces to describe states of being may be of interest in the description of state determination in both illness and health.

      "abstract": "Many aspects of human physiology and behaviour are dominated by 24-hour circadian rhythms that have a major impact on our health and well-being. These include the sleep-wake cycle, alertness and performance patterns, and many daily hormone profiles. The rhythms are spontaneously generated by an internal \"pacemaker\", the suprachiasmatic nuclei within the anterior hypothalamus. This master clock has, for most humans, an intrinsic rhythm slightly longer than 24 hours. Daily retinal light exposure is required to keep these circadian rhythms synchronized with the external 24-hour solar environment. This daily synchronization process generally poses no problems for sighted individuals although they experience some of the consequences of circadian desynchrony when \"jetlagged\" or working night shifts. However, many blind people with no perception of light experience periodical circadian desynchrony. This is due to the absence of light information to the hypothalamic circadian clock, resulting in poor synchronisationsynchronization of circadian rhythms. Affected patients experience cyclical or periodic episodes of poor sleep and daytime dysfunction, severely interfering with social, academic and professional life. The diagnosis of Non-24 Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder Syndrome, also named free-running disorder, non-entrained disorder or hypernycthemeral syndrome remains challenging from a clinical point of view due to the cyclical symptoms and should be confirmed by measurements of circadian biomarkers such as urinary melatonin to demonstrate a circadian period outside the normal range. Management includes behavioural modification and melatonin. Tasimelteon, a novel melatonin receptor 1 and 2 agonist, has demonstrated its effectiveness and safety with an evening dose of 20 mg in and is currently the only treatment approved by the FDA and the EMA.",

Nonetheless, there were certain unexpected regularities in his sleep-wake data, corresponding to fixed clock hours. Across the 4-year period, there were certain clock hours during which sleep onset and waking were likely to occur and certain clock hours that may be considered forbidden zones for sleep, during which the patient rarely either began or ended a sleep period. It is possible that the unexpected regularities resulted from partial entrainment to external cues or from some residual influence of an endogenous ultradian-regulating mechanism.",

Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are perhaps the most often overlooked conditions in the differential diagnosis of these symptoms.

The two most prevalent circadian rhythm sleep disorders are delayed sleep phase (common in adolescents) and advanced sleep phase (common in the elderly), situations in which the sleep period is displaced to a later or earlier time, respectively. It is important to keep these two disorders in mind, since they can be confused with insomnia and excessive sleepiness. However, there are nine possible diagnoses, and all nine are of clinical interest. Since light is the principal cue used in synchronizing the biological clock, blind individuals and night-shift/swing-shift workers are more prone to develop circadian rhythm sleep disorders.

Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

In certain situations, the circadian potentiation of wakefulness may interfere with desired sleep-scheduling, particularly in the elderly and shift workers. Known abnormalities of circadian regulation are defined by their impact on sleep-wake state expression. In delayed sleep phase syndrome, patients have trouble going to sleep and arising at reasonable hours and are alert in the evening and sleepy in the morning. Patients with advanced sleep phase syndrome are sleepy in the evening and awaken very early and alert in the morning. In shift-work sleep disorder, individuals attempt to wake and sleep out of phase with the circadian clock. As with jet lag, the clock is functioning normally, but the requirements on the clock are abnormal. Typical insomnia can also be associated with circadian rhythm alterations. Practice guidelines and clinical studies data are needed to lead appropriate therapy selection and effective management.",

      "abstract": "Au stade de meningoencephalite, la trypanosomose humaine africaine (THA), ou maladie du sommeil, represente un trouble du rythme circadien du cycle veille-sommeil plutot qu'une hypersomnie. En effet, chez tous ces patients au repos au lit pendant 24 heures, le temps de sommeil total ne depasse pas 9 heures. La perturbation de la distribution circadienne de la veille et du sommeil est proportionnelle a la gravite des signes cliniques et biologiques. La structure interne du sommeil est egalement perturbee. Tous les patients presentent des SOREMP (Sleep Onset REM Periods), certains episodes de sommeil debutant par du sommeil paradoxal. Des la mise en place du traitement par le melarsoprol, le trouble circadien retrocede rapidement chez les patients les moins atteints, le nombre de SOREMP diminue ou elles disparaissent. D'autres rythmes circadiens sont perturbes dans la THA. C'est le cas des secretions hormonales qui cependant gardent intactes leurs relations avec les etats de sommeil et de veille. Ainsi, le rythme circadien de secretion de la prolactine, de la renine, de l'hormone de croissance et du cortisol disparait chez les malades les plus atteints, mais persiste chez les autres. L'amplitude et la valeur moyenne de la secretion de melatonine sont normales chez les patients, avec un pic nocturne et une absence de secretion diurne. Cependant, le pic est en avance de phase de 2 heures par rapport a celui de sujets africains sains. En conclusion, la maladie du sommeil represente une perturbation du systeme circadien proportionnelle au niveau de gravite clinique de la maladie. La presence de SOREMP et l'avance de phase de la secretion de melatonine sont en faveur d'une perturbation des reseaux serotoninergiques plutot que d'une atteinte directe de l'horloge interne.",

      "title": "Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep disorders occur when individuals attempt to sleep at the wrong circadian time. The misalignment between the internal circadian timing system and the external environment is typically due to either an alteration in the functioning of the circadian timing system (e.g., delayed or advanced sleep phase disorder) or to changes in the external environment (e.g., jet lag). However, the clinical presentation of most of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is influenced by a combination of physiologic, behavioral, and environmental factors. These disorders lead to complaints of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, with impairment in important areas of functioning and quality of life. Current treatments, such as timed exposure to bright light and exogenous melatonin, primarily serve to align the timing of circadian rhythms or increase the strength of the circadian signal. Although these treatments are effective, their use in clinical practice has been limited by the availability of adequate diagnostic tools and large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials. The rapid advances in our understanding of the molecular, cellular, and physiologic basis of circadian regulation and the pathophysiology of these disorders will lead to more targeted and effective treatments.",

When the restriction extends to 2 weeks, it can reach levels of impairment that are comparable to 2 nights in total sleep deprivation, resulting in problems in memory consolidation, as well as impaired attention, learning and executive functioning (working memory, cognitive flexibility, self-monitoring, impulsiveness, planning and inhibition, and social cognition). Although the association between sleep restriction and memory disorders is well known, there is insufficient information regarding alterations in executive functions, specifically those of social cognition in subjects with sleep restriction. Social cognition involves those human skills necessary to successfully interact in a social environment and according to recent research, it can be affected if people cannot sleep.",

Cet etat est une caracteristique commune a l'exposition a l'altitude et au syndrome d'apnees obstructives du sommeil (SAOS), bien que celle-ci soit continue dans le premier cas et intermittente et nocturne dans le second.L'hypoxie d'altitude entraine une alteration des performances cognitives et motrices. La reduction de la performance a l'exercice en altitude a longtemps ete attribuee a une alteration du metabolisme musculaire du fait d'une reduction de l'apport en oxygene. Les perturbations cerebrales induites par l'hypoxie pourraient egalement avoir un role majeur dans cette limitation.Le SAOS, veritable enjeu de sante publique, est associe a des troubles cognitifs pouvant ainsi influencer le fonctionnement quotidien des patients souffrant de ce syndrome et resulter en une somnolence diurne excessive, une baisse de la qualite de vie ou encore une reduction de la productivite au travail et des performances scolaires. Le fait que ces alterations cerebrales puissent influencer les capacites motrices et a l'effort des patients atteints d’apnees obstructives du sommeil reste en revanche a investiguer.Au cours de ce travail de these, nous nous sommes interesses a deux modeles d’exposition hypoxique et a leurs consequences cerebrales et neuromusculaires. Nous avons tout d’abord etudie l'effet d'une exposition a l'hypoxie d'altitude aigue (quelques heures) et prolongee (plusieurs jours) sur la fonction neuromusculaire et ses repercussions a l'exercice chez le sujet sain. Nous avons ensuite etudie l'influence du modele d'hypoxie intermittente associe au SAOS sur la fonction neuromusculaire et la tolerance a l'exercice de ces patients. Nous avons ainsi cherche a caracteriser les alterations cerebrales a l'exercice en lien avec ce syndrome et leur reversibilite suite a un traitement en ventilation par pression positive continue.Chez le sujet sain, nous avons demontre que la performance a l'exercice impliquant une masse musculaire reduite (flechisseurs du coude) n'etait pas limitee par une fatigue centrale accrue apres 1 et 5 jours d'exposition a une altitude de 4350 m. Nous avons mis en evidence que la dysfonction musculaire (force et endurance reduites) observee chez le patient SAOS est associee a un deficit d'activation supraspinal et une augmentation de l'inhibition intracorticale. De plus, nos resultats suggerent qu'une alteration de la reponse cerebrovasculaire a l'exercice puissent impacter negativement la tolerance a l'exercice des patients souffrant d'un SAOS severe. Ces alterations neuromusculaires et cerebrovasculaires n'etaient pas corrigees apres un traitement de huit semaines par ventilation nocturne en pression positive continue soulignant la nature persistante de ces alterations cerebrales.",

Optimal sleep requires the sleep–wake circadian rhythm to be synchronized to a 24-hour period. Light is a key determinant in the synchronization of the circadian rhythm to this period. Exposure to bright light in the morning can advance the sleep period, while bright light in the evening can delay the sleep period and lead to negative sleep outcomes. The home environment should make appropriate use of light so as to optimize sleep and eliminate environmental light pollution. Light can also be utilized to treat circadian phase sleep disorders.",

Whether these decrements are caused by short sleep duration or extended wakefulness is unknown. In this study, healthy volunteers were randomized into either a chronically sleep-restricted or control protocol while living on a 20-h “day,” thus enabling short sleep without extended wakefulness. We demonstrate that chronic insufficient sleep, even without extended wakefulness, leads to neurobehavioral performance decrements at all times of the day, even when the circadian system is promoting arousal. These findings have implications for the understanding of basic physiology, the substantial population who chronically obtains insufficient sleep, and all of us who depend on sleep-restricted individuals working in safety-sensitive occupations.",

Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders(CRSWDs) refer to the inconsistency between the human body's circadian behavioral activities and the needs of social life. Common classifications classify it as Delayed sleep phase type (DSP), Advanced sleep phase type (ASP), Free-running type and Irregular sleep-wake type. The potential pathogenesis of CRSWDs is closely related to human clock genes. Emens et al reported finding that N24H sleep-wake disorder is an important milestone in etiology. Light is the stronges inducement of circadian rhythm. CRSWDs may due to the long-term lack of light and other external timing factors, leading to circadian rhythm disorders and sleep homeostasis imbalance rather than being driven by a disorder of the central circadian clock. Regular exposure to strong light is often used to treat CRSWDs. This paper briefly introduces the historical background of understanding circadian rhythm, and then the common pathogenesis and mechanism of sleep wake disorder with different circadian rhythms and the corresponding treatment were discussed.",

Basic cognitive processes, such as attention, working memory, and executive functions, show homeostatic (time awake, sleep deprivation) and circadian (time of day) variations. Each of these cognitive processes includes several components, which contribute sequentially to the homeostatic and circadian modulation of performance. Sudden (lapses) and gradual changes in cognitive performance occur with sleep deprivation or with time of day. The time course of human cognitive processes throughout the day is relevant to the programming of different human activities. The lowest level of cognitive performance occurs during nighttime and early in the morning, a better level occurs around noon, and even higher levels occur during afternoon and evening hours. However, this time course can be modulated by conditions such as chronotype, sleep deprivation, sleep disorders or medication that affects the central nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

      "abstract": "Introduction Circadian rhythm (CR) dysfunction is a prominent feature in bipolar disorder (BD) and sleep disturbances are characteristic, although not essential to the diagnosis. Objectives To review the literature regarding the CR dysfunction and its impact on the onset and clinical course of BD. Methods We conducted a MEDLINE search using bipolar disorder, circadian rhythm and sleep as keywords, selecting studies written in English. Results CR dysfunction is a trait marker of BD. It’s known that during depressive episodes insomnia is present, with difficulty falling asleep/ maintaining sleep and early awakening. Regarding mania, decreased need for sleep is a critical marker. During the euthymic period significant alterations in sleep pattern have been described. It’s also known that changes in the sleep pattern occur prior to those in mood patterns, indicating that sleep dysregulation may trigger the onset of mood episodes or relapses. Therefore, CR disruption may be associated with the pathophysiology of BD and some factors have already been identified: irregularity of the sleep-wake rhythm, eveningness chronotype, abnormality of melatonin secretion, vulnerability of clock genes and the irregularity of social zeitgeber. Conclusions Disturbances of sleep are pervasive, and an essential feature of BD, worse during mood episodes, but still present during euthymic periods. It remains to determine whether circadian rhythm dysfunction is a trait marker or mood state dependent. Further studies are warranted to clarify this association.

      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital function to all species for reinvigorating the mental and physical senses. During sleep, specific synapses become less active to eliminate unneeded memories as other synapses strengthen to enhance memory consolidation. Healthy quality and longevity of sleep can also regulate moods by ridding fatigue and repairing integrity of the medial prefrontal cortex-amygdala connections. External disturbances affect the quality of sleep, and an individual's routine may play a role in the development of sleeping disorders. By irregulating the circadian rhythm and having consistent negative sleeping habits, sleep disorders such as insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea may develop. Eight to nine hours of sleep are recommended to both teenagers and adults, if less is received, difficulty in concentration and interpretation of information may be present, as well as physiological effects such as higher blood pressure caused by the disrupted regulation of stress hormones, which if continued, can make the body more prone to serious health conditions.The science of sleep and dreaming comprises a relevant thesis in modern neuroscience research and issues major comprehensions on the study of human consciousness. Dreams are an integral part of sleep. Sleep and dream cycles vary in phenomenology, characteristics, and under circumstances, interpretation of the individual. Various theories such as Sigmun Freud's Psychodynamic theory, the activation synthesis model, and the cognitive development theory have been created and numerous studies are ongoing as the principal motive of dreams has not yet been concluded. Some theories remain heavily physiological as high difficulty of investigations are discontinued by scientists and deemed unverifiable. The research presented here revolves around the neurology of sleep as to inquire into the physiology and investigations on the purpose of dreams. We thus conclude the current review with a call for further research directed towards the primary purpose of sleep and dream.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "title": "Stress and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Obtaining a sufficient quantity and quality of sleep is important for good health. Chronic partial sleep deprivation, also known as insufficient sleep, is common in our society. The consequences include depressed mood, interpersonal irritability, decreased daytime vigilance, weight gain, coronary artery disease, and cognitive impairment (Kecklund and Axelsson 2016). Determining what amount of sleep is sufficient for an individual is difficult for several reasons. Sleep duration gradually decreases from a starting length of 16 hours per 24-hour day as human beings transition from infancy to adulthood. Interindividual differences in the optimal amount of sleep range from 6 to 12 hours, with a mean of 7.5 hours for adults. When a primary sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (OSAH), is present, the continuity and depth of sleep may be compromised independently of sleep duration. Recognizing how much sleep any individual requires is complicated. Nonetheless, there is consensus that chronically inadequate sleep is detrimental to health.",

      "abstract": "Introducao: O sono e uma necessidade fisiologica do ser humano, e faz parte dos ritmos biologicos do ciclo circadiano. Entretanto, um dos disturbios mais comuns e a insonia (INS). A INS consiste em uma maior latencia para dormir com prejuizos durante o periodo de vigilia, apresentando dificuldades de concentracao, estresse e sonolencia diurna. Pode ser evidenciada nas formas aguda, ou cronica e varia com idade e genero sendo as mulheres idosas mais acometidas. A mesma possui varias causas, desde disturbios psicologicos, preocupacoes ate uso exacerbado de substâncias estimulantes como a cafeina. Este disturbio do sono tem se apresentado fortemente nos dias de hoje, associado ao estresse vivido na sociedade. E comum na senescencia, ocorrerem alteracoes na quantidade e qualidade do sono, e estudos apontam que metade dos adultos acima de 65 anos de idade, sofrem deficit em sua qualidade de vida. O sono e primordialmente controlado pelo sistema nervoso central, com secrecao de substâncias e neurotransmissores responsaveis por regular o ciclo circadiano. Durante o envelhecimento ha uma diminuicao encefalica de substâncias endogenas que induzem o sono, como a melatonina. Com isto, idosos possuem inumeros despertares ao longo da noite, costumam acordar mais cedo, e possuem dificuldade de permanecer adormecidos. Objetivo: Estimar a prevalencia de insonia em idosos usuarios do sistema unico de saude (SUS) do municipio de Osorio/RS. Metodologia: O estudo possui delineamento retrospectivo e transversal e obteve aprovacao pelo comite de etica em pesquisa da instituicao sob o numero de parecer 1.324.451. A analise dos dados se deu por meio de valores absolutos e porcentagem do total da amostra. Resultados: Verificou-se no periodo entre 2009 e 2016, 10.497 pacientes de ambos os sexos e acima de 60 anos cadastrados no sistema de saude da prefeitura, sendo 5.869 mulheres (55,91%), e 4.628 homens (44,09%). A prevalencia de insonia mostrou-se maior no sexo feminino com 157 (1,49%) casos, seguida de 57 (0,54%) no sexo masculino, totalizando em 214 (2,03%) casos. Consideracoes finais: Esta e a quarta patologia do sistema nervoso central (SNC) mais prevalente no municipio de Osorio/RS. Sabe-se que alteracoes do o sono como a insonia podem ser consequencias de outros disturbios relacionados com a velhice associados a saude mental e fisica, como a doenca de Alzheimer, Parkinson e depressao. Maiores politicas de saude devem ser elaboradas e aprimoradas para o que os idosos do municipio tenham uma melhor qualidade de vida, resultando em um sono mais adequado para o descanso das atividades do periodo de vigilia.",

Additionally, many of the same brain areas affected by neurodegenerative diseases include the sleep and wake promoting systems. Any advances in our knowledge of these sleep/wake and circadian networks are necessary to target neural areas or connections for therapy.

It is important to distinguish excessive daytime sleepiness from alterations in the level of consciousness, such as lethargy. During the night, a sleeper cycles through a series of sleep stages; this is called “sleep architecture.” Rapid-eye-movement sleep is the state in which most, but not all, dreaming experiences occur.

      "abstract": "Abstract There are two distinct types of sleep—non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—a balance of which is needed to function well during the day. During the night, these two types of sleep alternate with each other. Probably everyone dreams but the purpose of dreaming is generally unclear. The pattern of wakefulness and sleep is controlled by an internal clock in the brain (the body clock). Your level of alertness varies within each 24 hours. The tendency to sleep is greatest in the early hours of the morning (corresponding to deep NREM sleep) and (although less so) in the early afternoon. People vary in the time of day when they are most alert: ‘larks’ in the morning and ‘owls’ in the evening. Most people show neither of these patterns. Daytime naps can make it difficult to get to sleep at bedtime if they are too long or too late in the day. Long naps can make you feel groggy afterwards. Sleep has some features in common with other states of relative inactivity, such as coma or, in some species, hibernation. All of these states usually occur while lying down with little movement and reduced awareness of the environment to varying degrees. However, sleep is very different from the rest.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric sleep physiology begins with development of the sleep/wake cycle, and the origins of active versus quiet sleep. The 24-hour circadian cycle becomes established at 3-6 months. Sleep disorders during infancy commonly include mild, usually self-limited conditions such as sleep-onset association disorder, excessive nighttime feedings, and poor limit-setting. These require behavioral management to avoid long-term deleterious sleep habits. In contrast, other sleep disorders are more ominous, including SIDS, central congenital hypoventilation syndrome, and sleep apnea. Childhood is generally considered the golden age of sleep, with brief latency to sleep onset, high efficiency, and easy awakening. Yet parasomnias, psychological factors, and sleep disturbances associated with common disorders such as ADHD disrupt the idealistic notion of childhood being a period of unfettered sleep. Adolescents have sleep requirements similar to adults, posing a challenge for them to adapt to school schedules and increasingly demanding lifestyles. Narcolepsy, usually diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood, is a lifelong sleep disorder and has led to the identification of the hypocretin/orexin neurotransmitter system. Research advances in the complex interrelationships between developmental neurobiology, sleep disorders and behavior will lead to an enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of sleep problems and lead to novel therapeutic strategies for sleep disturbances in children.",

Partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night and phase-advance of the sleep-wake cycle induce temporary clinical remission: these experiments indicate that abnormally advanced rhythms are not merely an epiphenomenon but play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. They lead to the hypothesis that depression occurs in susceptible individuals when a sleep-sensitive phase of the circadian system becomes advanced from the first hours of waking into the last hours of sleep and interacts with sleep to cause depression.",

      "abstract": "As we have seen in the previous chapters on the physiology of sleep and circadian rhythm, two important processes affect circadian rhythm and sleep. Process C regulates the circadian rhythm and is entrained by light-dark cycles, and Process S is regulated by the homeostatic need for sleep, which is directly proportional to the duration of wakefulness. The interaction of the two processes generally happens such that the individual sleeps the best at nighttime and is awake and alert during daytime. Any advancement or delay in the biorhythm of sleep-wake that desynchronizes with the light-dark cycle over a period may cause symptoms related to day and night dysfunction. Such a dysfunction that persists for a period of 3 months qualifies as a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder (CRSWD). This chapter discusses various types of CRSWD, their diagnosis, and management recommendations.",

Spinal cord injuries usually occur during peak productivity years and survivors experience permanent disabilities that often impact employment opportunities. Injuries to the spinal cord cause temporary or permanent changes in motor, sensory, and/or autonomic function. The spinal cord is a critical component of the autonomic nervous system, and injury can often lead to changes in the quality of hair, skin, and nails, as well as the ability of the individual to response to temperature changes. One of the most serious complications is autonomic dysreflexia, a syndrome associated with spinal cord lesions at or above the T6 level. Gastrointestinal problems occur in 27–62% of individuals with spinal cord injuries, and symptoms include constipation, abdominal pain, incontinence, nausea, and diarrhea. Genitourinary dysfunction represents one of the most profound changes that occur in spinal cord injury.",

Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

D'autre part, la douleur entraîne souvent un sommeil de mauvaise qualité, voire de l'insomnie. Parmi les patients souffrant de douleur chronique (p. ex. lombalgie, douleur orofaciale, fibromyalgie ou arthrite rhumatoïde), près des deux tiers rapportent que leur sommeil n'est pas suffisamment récupérateur. La relation entre la douleur et le sommeil est soit unidirectionnelle soit bidirectionnelle-circulaire. Une crise de douleur aiguë, précédant le plus souvent une plainte de mauvais sommeil, suggère une relation unidirectionnelle. Toutefois, chez les patients souffrant de douleur chronique ou intense (p. ex. post-brûlure), à une mauvaise nuit de sommeil succède une exacerbation diurne de la douleur qui, à son tour, peut diminuer la qualité du sommeil suivant et ainsi de suite. Il s'agit alors d'un trouble bidirectionnel circulaire. Des études polysomnographiques ont mis en évidence certaines caractéristiques physiologiques chez le patient souffrant de douleur chronique. La plus fréquente est l'intrusion d'ondes alphadelta électroencéphalographiques dénotant une activité corticale rapide normalement associée à l'état d'éveil. Cette intrusion, d'une durée de 20 à 40 secondes, répétée de façon périodique au cours du sommeil, reflète l'expression de micro-éveils cérébraux et du système nerveux autonome cardio-sympathique. D'autre part, des études expérimentales ont permi de caractériser les effets de la douleur sur l'architecture du sommeil. En effet, on a noté que la douleur induisait des éveils prolongés importants pendant tous les stades de sommeil (léger, profond etparadoxal) contrairement à ce que l'on pense généralement.",

      "abstract": "Electrical lighting and increasing capital intensiveness have helped undermine the importance that society previously placed on obtaining adequate sleep. Even modest amounts of daily sleep loss accumulate as “sleep debt.” Sleep debt manifests in a myriad of ways, the most common being an increasing tendency to fall asleep, increased risk of accidental injury, impaired mood, and reduced psychomotor performance. Sleep debt can have far reaching consequences, both to an individual in terms of increased cardiovascular risk and to society at large, because of sleepiness-related fatigue and errors. Sleep specialists need to further their understanding of the physiologic and behavioral consequences of total, partial, and selective sleep stage deprivation, because they affect many organ systems. Studies of selective sleep stage deprivation also provide insights into the function of sleep. Evaluating the effects of sleep deprivation must take into account the following factors: (1) the duration of prior sleep, (2) circadian time frame, (3) arousal influences, and (4) subject and test characteristics. Sleep deprivation has been extensively studied in the acute experimental setting. Under extreme conditions, sleep deprivation is associated with mortality in laboratory animals. In the natural human environment, the behavioral consequence of chronic sleep debt in shift work intolerance is well described. The link between electrophysiological sleep disturbance and pathogenesis of disease is less well understood in both acute and chronic states. Additional investigation into the relationship between sleep deprivation and disease mechanisms, such as impaired glucose tolerance, hormonal dysregulation, and cytokine imbalance, will enhance our comprehension of this link.",

The bizarre features of dreams may be divided into three broad categories: discontinuities, incongruities and uncertainties. Discontinuities are interruptions in orientational stability; incongruities are inappropriate syntheses of mismatching plot elements; uncertainties are confusions of distinct conceptions. Dream bizarreness appears to be the manifestation of some state-dependent cognitive process which is probably rooted in REM sleep neurophysiology. In the waking state, our brain/minds are capable of remaining focused on the normal flow of ongoing information, and such features of life as plot and time unfold in a linear sequence. In REM sleep/dreaming, this function appears to be interfered with, and disparate elements of consciousness are suddenly interjected as the brain/mind cannot maintain its orientational focus in the usual way.",

      "title": "[Nighttime eating disorders--clinical symptoms and treatment].",
      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

A chronic illness has a lengthy duration, uncertain outcome, and unpredictable episodes, often with intrusive symptoms and intermittent or progressive disability. Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

Patient's clinical features may support a specific dissociative disorder subtype diagnosis associated with sleep-related episodes, specifically dissociative identity disorder, dissociative fugue, or dissociative disorder NOS. With any form of sleep-related dissociative disorder, onset can be gradual and sporadic in nature. Females are reported to be affected predominantly, and onset can range from childhood to midlife. Sexualized and frankly sexual behaviors can emerge with sleep-related dissociative disorders. There are several potential considerations for differential diagnosis of sleep-related dissociative disorders, including an NREM arousal disorder parasomnia, parasomnia associated with REM sleep, or nocturnal seizures.",

A peculiar phase other than p. p can be seen in human natural sleep, . which might be called reverse paradoxical phase (r. p. p), for the relation between EEG pattern and the activity level of many other physiological. functions is the reverse of that in p. p.2. P. p and r. p. p are two different manifestations of the dissociation between EEG and many other physiological activities, especially vegetative functions.3. The fact that p. p is apt to appear at the end of each single sleep cycleand r. p. p comes at the beginning or in the middle of each single sleep cycle could account for the phasic shift of changes in EEG and other physiological functions.4. The prominent occurrence of p. p in the latter half and r. p. p in the first half of the natural night sleep could be attributed to the difference in distribution pattern of activity level of each physiological function. For instance, more occurence of EEG III can be seen in the earlier period of the night sleep, while the depressed or minor activity of GSR, blood pressure is distributed more in the latter half of the night sleep.",

The prevalence of mood disorders in the population is the highest among the diagnosed mental illnesses. In the U.S., an estimated 21.4% of adults have experienced a clinically significant mood disorder at some time in their lives. Mood disorders are characterized by dysfunctional affective responses associated with emotional regulation alterations, thoughts' contents, and volition. Among the symptoms of mood disorders, disturbances of sleep and activity patterns are recognized as core diagnostic criteria. Despite the high degree of comorbidity between dysfunctional mood and sleep/activity patterns, the biological underpinnings common to the two illnesses are still unknown. The alternation of sleep and wakefulness follows a circadian cycle, determined by the synchronization between the external environment and the organism's internal clock. Virtually, the body's circadian system influences all aspects of an organism's functioning, including gene regulation, cellular communication, cognitive performance, and emotional states. In this context, the association between mood disorders and the circadian system appears critical in the etiology of this class of mental diseases. This review aims to integrate the vast heterogeneity of findings linking mood with circadian factors. The picture that emerges indicates that mood is strongly influenced by the interaction with different components of the circadian system, such as exogenous modulators of the circadian system (e.g., food, drugs, and light exposure), clock gene alterations, and behavioral patterns. Advances in comprehending the complex relationship between mood and the biological cycles would lead to identifying novel biomarkers of mood disorders, with future improvements in treatment optimization.",

      "abstract": "Introducción El sueño es un estado natural y fisiológico rítmico, aparece por la melatonina activada por la oscuridad, esto disminuye la conciencia, inmovilidad, relajación muscular. También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

      "title": "Relationship Between Sleep Disorders and Mental Health",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders refer to a spectrum of conditions that interfere with regular sleep patterns. One of the most frequently reported clinical issues is sleep disturbance. Physiological, neurological, social, and mental well-being can be critically affected by insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Overall, health and quality of life can be impacted by sleep disorders. Mental health and sleep share a significant relationship. It has long been acknowledged that individuals with mental health disorders frequently experience sleep issues. The predominant theory has been that sleep issues are basically signs of the psychiatric disorders that they are interrelated with. The fact that sleep issues are defining characteristics of a number of psychiatric disorders and are included in the diagnostic criteria for these conditions supports this aspect. However, sleep and mental health problems are associated further in diverse ways. Emerging research evidence suggests that the relationship between mental health problems and sleep disorders is complex and includes bi-directional causation, in contrast to the long-held view of this relationship that considered sleep issues as symptoms of psychiatric disorders. An increased prevalence of mental/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among certain others, is reported among patients with insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and narcolepsy, suggesting sleep disorders as a risk factor for mental health disorders. Although much has been established about the relationship between impaired mental health and sleep, further research is required to elaborately comprehend this relationship. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the relationship between sleep disorders and mental health.",

      "title": "Physical activity, participation and health-related quality of life in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple osteochondromas",
      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

Insufficient sleep can have important effects on daytime function by increasing the need to nap, reducing cognitive ability including attention and memory, slowing response time, adversely affecting relationships with friends and family, and contributing to a general sense of being unwell. However, rather than aging per se, circadian rhythm shifts, primary sleep disorders, comorbid medical/psychiatric illnesses, and medication use cause sleep difficulties in older people, which psychosocial factors may also affect. Clinicians should ask elderly patients about satisfaction with sleep. Any sleep complaints warrant careful evaluation of contributing factors and appropriate treatment.",

Pro lepsi klasifikaci poruch spanku bylo v roce 1990 nově přepracovana verze Mezinarodni klasifikace poruch spanku (International Classification of slep Disorders {--} ICSD) ve spolupraci s různými asociacemi a spolecnostmi pro výzkum poruch spanku. Poruchy spanku se podle teto mezinarodni klasifikace děli na primarni poruchy kam zařezujeme dyssomnii a parasomnii a sekundarni poruchy, ktere jsou spojene s onemocněnim somatickým nebo dusevnim. Přiciny poruch spanku mohou být různe, a proto se diagnostika musi být pecliva. Sestra se zde take velkou casti zapojuje do diagnostiky. Při výzkumu bych chtěla zjistit, jake maji klienti v domovech důchodců poruchy spanku, jak jsou informovani o poruchach spanku a jestli maji klienti vhodne prostředi pro spanek. Hypoteza, že klienti v domovech důchodců trpi poruchu usinani se potvrdila. Hypoteza, že klienti v domovech důchodců jsou informovani o poruchach spanku se potvrdila, ale s malým rozdilem od varianty, že informace klienti o poruchach spanku nemaji. Hypoteza o neznalosti metod pro navozeni kvalitniho spanku se potvrdila. Hypoteza, že klienti v domově důchodců maji vhodne prostředi pro spanek se nepotvrdila. Sestra je zde velmi důležita, protože je vždy na blizku. Měla by se zajimat o problemy klientů se spankem a snažit se je řesit jinak než farmakologickou cestou. Sestry by měly být dostatecně informovane o těchto důležitých krocich, aby s těmito informacemi uměli zachazet a použivat je ve sve praxi. Spanek přece slouži k celkove regeneraci a nacerpani nových sil.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The autonomic nervous system innervates all organs, producing predominantly involuntary and automatic actions that are mediated by two principal efferent pathways, the sympathetic and parasympathetic, which are neurochemically and anatomically distinct. Numerous synaptic relays and neurotransmitters allow the autonomic control of organ function at local and central levels to be integrated with the requirements of the whole body. The peripheral and central components of the autonomic nervous system are frequently affected by diseases, conditions, or toxins. Autonomic disorders are described as (1) primary—without defined cause, including multiple system atrophy and acute/subacute dysautonomias; or (2) secondary—with specific defects or as a consequence of other conditions, including diabetes mellitus, Riley–Day syndrome, amyloid neuropathy, dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency, spinal cord injury, and many drugs.",

      "abstract": "Shift work sleep disorder is a common problem in industrialized countries because of the need for occupations and services to continue to function 24 hours/day. Approximately 20% of employed adults in the United States are engaged in shift work. Shift work sleep disorder is diagnosed if there is a report of insomnia or excessive sleepiness for at least 3 months associated with a recurring work schedule that overlaps the usual time for sleep. Shift work is associated with an increased occurrence of metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, and it has been implicated in weight gain and cognitive impairment. There is evidence of increased absenteeism in night workers compared with day workers. A planned sleep schedule, timed bright light exposure, timed melatonin administration, and stimulants or drugs promoting alertness can be used to manage shift work sleep disorder. Jet lag is characterized by a misalignment between internal circadian rhythms and local time caused by rapid travel across at least two time zones. Not all travelers experience jet lag; risk factors include age, number of time zones crossed, and circadian preference. Management includes timed melatonin along with optional timed and dosed bright light exposure.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical phenomena or behavior that develop during the sleep period. These abnormal events or experiences are not principally abnormalities of the states of sleep and wakefulness, and they are not generally associated with major complaints of excessive sleepiness or insomnia. Parasomnias can manifest as activation of skeletal muscles or the autonomic nervous system during sleep. They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness. Occasionally, parasomnias may give rise to violent and potentially injurious behavior. Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1. Disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors 2. Parasomnias usually associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, including REM sleep behavior disorder (including parasomnia overlap disorder and status dissociatus), recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorder 3. Other parasomnias, including sleep-related dissociative disorder, sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning (catathrenia), exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "title": "Change In Mental Status",
      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

At least three types of circadian rhythm abnormalities have been described in such patients: blunting of circadian rhythms' amplitudes, advanced position (or even nonentrainment) of circadian rhythms' phases, and doubling of the length of the sleep-wake cycle from 24 to 48 h. Several types of experiments indicate that alterations in the timing of sleep and wakefulness relative to other circadian rhythms (i.e., changes in internal phase relationships) may trigger the onset or offset of episodes of depression and mania. Whether drugs used to treat manic-depressive illness act through their effects on the circadian system is currently being investigated. Direct manipulations of the circadian system are also being investigated as new approaches to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Schedule-dependent sleep problems tend to increase as the youngster moves from middle childhood through preadolescence and into adolescence. This is partly because the youngster becomes more independent and parental control over both the selection of particular sleep schedules and the consistent maintenance of these schedules across weekends diminishes. Even accurate descriptions of the existing problem may become difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, specific syndromes are common and may be identified and treated. There may be increased demands at both ends of the sleep period leading to later bedtimes, earlier wakings, insufficient sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Periods of wakefulness confined to one portion of the night (beginning, middle, or end) may occur if sleep requirements are overestimated. Insomnia coupled with trouble waking may imply a circadian phase shift abnormality or a 'school-refusal' variant. And, variable sleep difficulties may be seen in a youngster with irregular schedules and poor sleep hygiene. Guidelines to the understanding, evaluation, and treatment of these syndromes are presented.",

      "abstract": "This chapter explores the causes, consequences, and countermeasures of jet lag, mistimed sleep, and sleep inertia. Jet lag can occur when rapidly crossing multiple time zones (e.g., trans-meridian travel for long-haul pilots). The desynchrony between the body's biological clock, or circadian rhythm, and the new day-night cycle can lead to indigestion, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive impairments. Mistimed sleep can also occur within a time zone. In the case of night shiftwork, sleep is displaced to the daytime which leads to poor sleep and increased fatigue at night due to the combination of pressures from the two-process model of sleep regulation: sleep loss (homeostatic pressure) and being awake when the body is promoting sleep (circadian pressure). There is also a third process of sleep regulation called sleep inertia, which refers to the brief period of fatigue and impaired cognitive performance experienced after waking. Sleep inertia can be a fatigue risk for transportation workers who work on-call (e.g., emergency services) or who nap on shift (e.g., long-haul truck drivers) and are required to perform a safety-critical task soon after waking. For each of these fatigue risks, strategic exposure to bright light can be used to help realign sleep timing and to promote alertness.",

Setiap orang memerlukan kebutuhan istirahat atau tidur yang cukup agar\r\ntubuh dapat berfungsi secara normal (Wicaksono, 2012). Tidur merupakan salah\r\nsatu fungsi biologis yang berperan penting dalam status kesehatan individu.\r\nSebagian individu mengalami masalah dengan tidurnya, dimana gangguan tidur\r\nyang sering terjadi salah satunya adalah insomnia (Putri dan Bayhakki, 2016).\r\nDi Indonesia, belum diketahui angka pastinya namun prevalensi pada orang\r\ndewasa mencapai 20% (Wicaksono, 2012). Insomnia merupakan keadaan tidak\r\ndapat tidur atau terganggunya pola tidur. Orang yang bersangkutan mungkin tidak\r\ndapat tidur, sukar untuk jatuh tidur, atau mudah terbangun dan kemudian tidak\r\ndapat tidur lagi. Insomnia umumnya merupakan kondisi sementara atau jangka\r\npendek. Dalam beberapa kasus, insomnia dapat menjadi kronis. Hal ini sering\r\ndisebut sebagai gangguan tidur yang paling sering terjadi yang berhubungan\r\ndengan situasional stres akut, seperti pekerjaan baru atau menjelang ujian.\r\nInsomnia ini biasanya hilang ketika stressor hilang atau individu telah beradaptasi\r\ndengan stressor. Namun, insomnia sementara sering berulang ketika tegangan\r\nbaru atau serupa muncul dalam kehidupan pasien (Kaplan dan Sadock, 2010).\r\nDalam TCM, insomnia yang diakibatkan sindrom hiperaktivitas Yang karena\r\ndefisiensi Yin disebabkan karena kebiasaan makan manis sehingga terjadi panas\r\npada lambung yang dapat mengganggu fungsi transformasi dan transportasi limpa.\r\nDisamping itu, insomnia juga disebabkan karena suka berpikir. Berpikir yang\r\nmelampaui batas mengakibatkan peredaran Qi terhalang dan fungsi transportasi\r\ndan transformasi Pi-limpa tidak berjalan dengan normal. Organ lambung yang\r\nekses dan organ limpa yang defisiensi (unsur tanah) tidak dapat membatasi organ\r\nginjal sehingga menyebabkan defisiensi Yin pada organ ginjal. Dengan adanya\r\ndefisiensi Yin ginjal menyebabkan Yin ginjal tidak dapat menguap ke atas untuk\r\nmembatasi Yang Qi jantung. Karena Yin ginjal tidak dapat membatasi Yang Qi\r\njantung menyebabkan terjadinya hiperaktivitas api jantung. Saat api jantung\r\nterganggu, Shen-jiwa ikut terganggu menyebabkan terjadinya insomnia.\r\nPenanganan yang dilakukan pada penderita insomnia yaitu terapi akupresur\r\ndan terapi herbal. Terapi akupresur dilakukan pada titik Neiguan (PC6), Shenmen\r\n(HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) dilakukan sebanyak 12 kali terapi yang diberikan\r\nsebanyak 3 kali dalam seminggu. Serta terapi herbal setiap hari selama 28 hari\r\ndengan menggunakan simplisia daun putri malu (Mimosa pudica) dengan dosis 10\r\ngram yang direbus dengan 750 mL air, diminum sehari 1 kali sebanyak 200 mL\r\nsebelum tidur.\r\nDari hasil setelah pemberian terapi kombinasi akupresur pada titik Neiguan\r\n(PC6), Shenmen (HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) serta pemberian herbal putri malu\r\n(Mimosa pudica) dapat memberikan hasil yang baik terhadap pasien dengan\r\nkeluhan insomnia.

Movements typical of the wake pattern were seen occasionally during unequivocal sleep in all but two completed studies, and in each condition reappeared under similar circumstances. The movements were most likely to occur after awakenings or lightenings of sleep, or in stage one sleep. The movements were very rare during the deeper phases of sleep. Those movements that occurred during sleep without awakenings were usually preceded by arousal phenomena and, rarely, by sleep spindles or slow waves. The control group showed normal \"semipurposeful\" movements under the same conditions during sleep. The rare appearance of the different dyskinesias and normal movements under similar circumstances during sleep could be a result of common effects on the generator systems or changes in the excitability of the final common motor pathway.",

      "title": "Sleep, its regulation and possible mechanisms of sleep disturbances",
      "abstract": "The state of sleep consists of different phases that proceed in successive, tightly regulated order through the night forming a physiological program, which for each individual is different but stabile from one night to another. Failure to accomplish this program results in feeling of unrefreshing sleep and tiredness in the morning. The program core is constructed by genetic factors but regulated by circadian rhythm and duration and intensity of day time brain activity. Many environmental factors modulate sleep, including stress, health status and ingestion of vigilance-affecting nutrients or medicines (e.g. caffeine). Acute sleep loss results in compromised cognitive performance, memory deficits, depressive mood and involuntary sleep episodes during the day. Moreover, prolonged sleep curtailment has many adverse health effects, as evidenced by both epidemiological and experimental studies. These effects include increased risk for depression, type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to voluntary restriction of sleep, shift work, irregular working hours, jet lag and stress are important factors that induce curtailed or bad quality sleep and/or insomnia. This review covers the current theories on the function of normal sleep and describes current knowledge on the physiologic effects of sleep loss. It provides insights into the basic mechanisms of the regulation of wakefulness and sleep creating a theoretical background for understanding different disturbances of sleep.",

      "title": "Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders and Cardiac Arrhythmia",
      "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) includes a range of conditions characterized by abnormalities in the frequency and/or depth of breathing during sleep. Cessations in breathing rhythm (apneas) are momentary and often cyclical, while reductions in breath amplitude (hypopneas) may be momentary or sustained (Dempsey et al., 2010). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome (HS), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, central sleep apnea (CSA), upper airway resistance syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) are the primary sleep-related respiratory disorders. Although CSA is accompanied by alterations in neural input, the obstruction characteristic of OSA, the most common form of SDB, is also neurally mediated (Veasey, 2009). Intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep characteristic of OSA result from collapse of the upper airway. The concomitant disruption of normal ventilation and sleep architecture is typically associated with snoring, repeated arousals from sleep, and daytime sleepiness (Bradley & Floras, 2003; Lattimore et al, 2003; Quan & Gersh, 2004; Shamsuzzaman et al; 2003;). Prevalence studies indicate that SDB, and particularly OSA, are common problems worldwide, affecting millions of individuals. However, OSA is also considered to be largely undiagnosed (Young et al, 1993; Young et al, 2002; Lavie, 2007). In the United States, for example, the estimated proportions of adults with OSA who are not diagnosed range from 60% to 80%, with an even greater under diagnosis suspected for children (Carter III, 2008). The increasing prevalence can be intuitively associated with the global obesity epidemic; however, a reverse association has also been postulated based on emerging evidence that OSA promotes weight gain (Carter III, 2008). The clinical relevance of OSA was thought for years to be limited to what was considered a benign but often annoying manifestation as snoring, ranging to the possibly serious consequences of daytime sleepiness affecting cognitive function and work performance, mental state, and driving ability. OSA is now known to be a risk factor for other serious conditions, and has been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Bradley & Floras, 2009; Devulapally et al., 2009; Lattimore et al, 2003; Lopez-Jiminez et al., 2008). Cardiac arrhythmias are common in OSA, and the potential link between tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias and adverse outcomes in OSA patients continues to be an important area of research (Chan & Wilcox, 2010; Verrier & Josephson, 2009). However, the complex cascade of events triggered by OSA, the difficulty in determining",

Individuals on a rotating three-shift or similar system work the night shift at the low phase of circadian rhythm. On retiring to bed in the morning they fall asleep rapidly but are prematurely awakened by their circadian rhythm and exhibit severe sleepiness and reduced performance capacity. In connection with the morning shift the circadian psychophysiology makes it difficult to fall asleep as early as needed during the preceding night. Around 0400 to 0500, when the individuals should rise, they have difficulties awakening because of the sleep loss and the circadian rhythm, which at that point is at its lowest. Subsequently, day work is characterized by sleepiness and reduced performance. It should be emphasized that it does not seem possible to improve one's ability to adjust over time, even with permanent night work. Older age and \"morningness\" personality are related to higher than average problems in adjusting.",

      "abstract": "Possible interactions between the sleep-wakefulness cycle and a new kind of spontaneous epilepsy, expressed as absence-like seizures and spike-wave bursts in FMUSP rats, are evaluated. The electro-oscillograms of some cortical and subcortical regions of the brain were recorded, as well as head, rostrum/vibrissae and eye movements. Recordings were performed uninterruptedly during 24 hours. The seizures were mostly concentrated in the wakefulness state but they could occur in any other phase, including paradoxical sleep. After the seizure, the rats usually returned to the same phase that was interrupted, although they often returned to wakefulness. There was an intense fragmentation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. The incidence of each cycle phase was significantly reduced, except SIII of synchronized sleep and paradoxical sleep, thus maintaining the overall duration and architecture of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. The fragmentation of the cycle seems to be due to an impairment of the very processes that generate sleep and wakefulness. Electrophysiological and behavioral profiles of the FMUSP rats recommend accurate and comprehensive study of the animal model owing to its resemblance to seizures in humans and also to discrepancies with existing genetic or experimental epilepsy models.",

      "title": "Sleep and the Athlete",
      "abstract": "Adequate sleep hygiene is increasingly recognized as a crucial part of athlete recovery, avoidance of overtraining or burnout, and optimization of health. Sleep impacts metabolic regulation and homeostasis and serves a vital restorative function (1). Sleep regulation occurs through an intrinsic sleep-wake cycle of optimal duration, coupled with a circadian rhythm that is influenced by environmental exposures, such as light and darkness. Other factors that affect sleep include exercise, diet/nutrition, supplements/stimulants, medications, travel, social/electronic media, and mental/physical health (2–4). In general, exercise favorably affects sleep quality and quantity (5). High-performance athletes, particularly adolescent and young adult athletes, are routinely exposed to greater physical, psychological, and neuromuscular stressors that require a delicate balance of recovery, including appropriate sleep (5). Athletes are at higher risk for sleep impairment for several reasons. Sleep deprivation is the most common sleep disorder, in general (6,7), and the frequency of both early morning and/or evening training sessions can decrease sleep duration, resulting in acute and cumulative sleep deprivation. A minimum of 7 h of sleep per day is ideal for optimal health in adults; adolescents require a minimum of 8 h of sleep per day (6,7) (Table). Traveling across time zones for competitions can have negative effects on circadian rhythms, particularly west to east travel. In general, it is prudent to allow at least 1 d for each time zone crossed for full resolution of jet lag symptoms (8,9). Additional studies have shown that between 50% and 80% of all athletes experience poor sleep quality during periods of heavy training and particularly on the nights before and after competition (5,10–12). Poor sleep quality and quantity can negatively affect cognitive and physical performance, perceived exertion, injury risk, and mental health (2–4). All of the above, along with increased pain, decreased task execution tolerance, and decreased cognitive and motor function (e.g., increased reaction times), are consistently correlated with increased injury risk in athletes (13–16). Daytime restorative napping, a common strategy that can reduce sleep debt, can improve short-term memory, alertness, and accuracy during reaction-time tests and should be incorporated, when necessary. Other sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent bedtimes, avoiding evening light exposure from technology and electronic devices, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining adequate hydration, and having a relaxation-focused bedtime routine (17,18).Table: National Sleep Foundation Sleep Duration Recommendations byAge (23).Athletes with mental health disorders and sport-related concussion (SRC) often display symptoms of disordered sleep. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in concussed athletes with up to 50% reporting sleep-related issues, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and impaired sleep quality. Sleep disturbance may hinder concussion recovery and can worsen psychiatric illness, memory, and social functioning (19). Unfortunately, inadequate sleep the night before neurocognitive concussion testing can lead to increased symptom scores, impeding return to play (20). Sleep quality and mental health impact each other (21). Sleep impairment can lead to increased stress, negative mood, and exacerbation of mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Conversely, the presence of mental illness can cause sleep disturbances. Optimizing sleep appears to improve overall mental health (21,22). Compensatory strategies, restorative approaches, and cognitive rehabilitation should be incorporated into comprehensive treatment plans for SRC patients and athletes with mental health disorders. Good sleep hygiene that includes adequate sleep duration, quality, and timing appears to be a crucial factor in athlete health, performance, adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention. Athletes must increase their awareness of sleep importance and develop strategies to maintain proper sleep regulation throughout training and competition.",

The former includes decreased amplitude and advanced phase of circadian rhythms (body temperature, melatonin secretion, and sleep-waking), as well as reduced sleep duration, sleep fragmentation, and a decrease of slow-wave sleep in sleep architecture. Pathological sleep disorders include medical and psychiatric diseases (e.g., lifestyle-related diseases, dementia, delirium, and depression) and primary age-related sleep disorders (e.g., REM sleep behavior disorder and periodic limb move- ment disorders).

      "abstract": "La Lesion Medular Espinal (LME) refiere a un suceso vital mayor que provoca importantes y permanentes cambios. Consiste en un cese de la senal neuronal que oca-siona una restriccion de las funciones motoras, sensitivas y vegetativas por debajo de la lesion. Una LME afecta gravemente a las funciones y capacidades de la persona. El estres diario puede entenderse como de¬mandas coti¬dianas y frus¬trantes que condicionan la interac¬cion del sujeto con el medio. Se ha encontrado que un aumento en la percepcion de contrariedades predice un empeoramiento de la sintomatologia psicologica y somatica. Las personas con una LME se en¬frentan a un amplio conjunto de situa¬ciones estresantes novedo¬sas. La calidad de vida (CV) es un constructo complejo y aun no se ha alcanzado un acuerdo general en su definicion. Puede interpretarse como un estilo personal cuyas caracteristicas serian encontrar un equilibrio entre expectativas, esperanzas y realida-des conseguidas o asequibles. Los objetivos principales de esta tesis fueron el desarrollo y validacion de una es-cala de me¬dida del estres diario en la LME, por un lado, y la medida y valoracion de la CV en la poblacion de lesionados medulares, asi como por que variables resulta mas influenciada, por otro. Para cubrir el primer objetivo, desarrollamos la Escala de Estres Diario para la Lesion Medular Espinal (EED–LME–26). Resulta importante puesto que en la actuali-dad no existe ninguna herra¬mienta para este proposito en esta poblacion. Para su crea-cion se utilizo una muestra de 105 sujetos. Se realizo un analisis factorial exploratorio obteniendose 9 dimensiones del estres. Posteriormente, aplicando analisis factorial confirmatorio validamos 8 de las 9 dimensiones anteriores. La validez concurrente de la escala se com¬probo a traves de correla¬ciones con otras medidas del estres psicoso-cial, mostrando que nuestra escala es adecuada para la evaluacion del estres diario en la LME. Para estimar la CV en la LME, se valoro el impacto de diversos indicadores obje-tivos, variables sociodemograficas, y psicosociales asi como la relacion de CV con la salud subjetiva. A tal fin, se llevo a cabo un analisis de regresion multiple hacia ade-lante. Su resultado mostro que la CV en los participantes de nuestra muestra se asocia negativamente con la gravedad de la LME, con una peor salud fisica, y con un incre-mento en la variable “consumo de analgesicos”. Y hubo una correlacion positiva con un nivel alto de hardiness, apoyo social, y vivienda adaptada. Consideramos que la EED–LME–26 sera un instru¬mento que pueda utilizarse en investigacio¬nes sobre la influencia del estres diario en lesionados medulares. Tambien podra servir al personal sani¬tario, psicolo¬gico y psiquia¬trico de cara a obtener infor-macion util y rele¬vante para la terapia con la LME y tratar trastornos psicologicos colaterales a la LME. En relacion con nuestro estudio de la CV en personas con una LME, se han proporcionado datos de interes tanto desde una perspectiva orientada a la salud, como, tambien, para colaborar con las distintas asociaciones de lesionados medulares y dis-capacitados, de manera que estas puedan emplearlos como un instrumento de sensibi-lizacion de los organismos oficiales. Adicionalmente, tanto la EED–LME–26 como las conclusiones derivadas de nuestra evaluacion de la CV en personas con una LME, podran resultar utiles de cara a actuar en lesionados medulares que no logran adaptarse a su nuevo entorno, que han perdido su trabajo y el panorama laboral no es propicio. Asimismo, resulta importante para establecer una optima relacion social y/o familiar. Logicamente tambien es im-portante que la sociedad asimile a los lesionados medulares como personas validas y capacitadas.",

Whether these disturbances are of etiological significance for the role of circadian rhythms in mood disorders, or a consequence of altered behavior can only be dissected out with stringent protocols (eg, constant routine or forced desynchrony). These protocols quantify contributions of the circadian pacemaker and a homeostatic sleep process impacting on mood, energy, appetite, and sleep. Future studies will elucidate any allelic mutations in \"circadian clock\" -related or \"sleep\"-related genes in depression. With respect to treatment, antidepressants and mood stabilizers have no consistent effect on circadian rhythmicity. The most rapid antidepressant modality known so far is nonpharmacological: total or partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night. The disadvantage of sleep deprivation, that most patients relapse after recovery sleep, can be prevented by coadministration of lithium, pindolol, serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors, bright light, or a subsequent phase-advance procedure. Phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle alone also has rapid effects on depressed mood, which lasts longer than sleep deprivation. Light is the treatment of choice for SAD and may prove to be useful for nonseasonal depression, alone or as an adjunct to medication. Chronobiological concepts emphasize the important role of zeitgebers to stabilize phase, light being the most important, but dark (and rest) periods, regularity of social schedules and meal times, and use of melatonin or its analogues should also be considered. Advances in chronobiology continue to contribute novel treatments for affective disorders.",

      "abstract": "The importance of sleep has been reported for decades. Epilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder comprising multiple elements that might influence sleep and wakefulness. Notably, animal studies show disruptions of the circadian molecular system in different models of epilepsy, along with altered rest-activity and other circadian rhythms. So far, studies of molecular circadian systems in people with epilepsy are lacking, prompting further research. Seizures-the primary and most debilitating symptom of epilepsy-and interictal activity disrupt regular sleep and sleep-wake rhythms. Alterations in one's sleep structure are seen in both drug-naïve and drug-resistant patients with epilepsy. In particular, low sleep efficiency, a reduction in total sleep time, and changes in sleep stages were found in both homogenous and mixed samples of epilepsy patients. Both ictal and interictal activity were also shown to be associated with changes in peripheral circadian phase biomarkers such as melatonin and cortisol. Moreover, epilepsy comorbidities, antiseizure medications, and a variety of syndromes can be a cause of sleep problems or even sleep disorders. Sleep disorders vary depending on various comorbidities and syndromes, and encompass all major groups of sleep disorders defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Controversial findings on the effects of various antiseizure medications were found in the literature. However, medications such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and barbiturates are particularly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Overall, a sleep evaluation must be included in the management of every patient with epilepsy.",

Physiological changes are minimal during moderate sleep loss, but mood changes are clearly noticeable. The most likely sleep problems for aircrew members are those associated with disruption of sleep- wakefulness cycles and partial sleep loss. Consistent performance decrement is difficult to find, but marked increase in fatigue is a common problem. Sleep loss, both total and partial, tends to potentiate the circadian influence on performance and interact with other stressors to enhance the stress-induced physiological responses. Deprivation of sleep stage REM or sleep stage 4 produces no behavioral changes supportive of earlier beliefs that these two stages, especially stage REM, were necessary for effective waking behavior.",

This category includes restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), sleep-related leg cramps, sleep-related bruxism, sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders (RMDs), sleep-related movement disorder due to a drug or substance, and sleep-related movement disorder due to a medical condition; finally sleeprelated movement disorder, unspecified when the disturbance does not fit into any of the above disorders. Some of these entities were previously categorized within the parasomnias or the wake-sleep transition disorders. Mostly, they involve simple, stereotyped movements during sleep or at the transition between waking and sleeping. RLS is a more complex disease with sensory disturbances occurring at rest and in the evening, and in which the motor accompaniment is mainly represented by the periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). All of these sleep-related movement disorders may cause fragmented sleep, insomnia, and/or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).",

      "abstract": "Snoring usually is trivial and unimportant, but it can turn into a social or medical problem. Obesity, hypertension and heart disease are more frequent among snorers than among nonsnorers, and especially snorers with hypersomnia during the day are at risk. Hypersomnia in association with snoring usually signifies obstructive sleep apnea. Increased resistance in the upper airways, together with negative inspiratory pharyngeal pressure and muscular hypotonia during deep non-REM and REM sleep, lead to collapse of the pharynx, hypoxia and hypercapnia. Only after arousal from sleep does muscle tone return, pharyngeal obstruction reopen and airflow resume. Since this process can occur 300 or 400 times a night, repetitive alveolar hypoventilation leads to pulmonary-arterial hypertension and cor pulmonale, and the repetitive sympathetic activations can cause systemic hypertension or serious cardiac arrhythmias. The countless arousals deprive the sufferer of deep non-REM and REM sleep and their consequence is sleep fragmentation. The symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, intellectual deterioration and personality and behavioral changes. Oronasomaxillofacial, endocrine and neuromuscular anomalies and diseases predispose to sleep apnea, and alcohol or CNS-depressant drugs can favour its occurrence. Diagnosis is made by nighttime oxymetry, and if this is abnormal, by polysomnography. After polysomnography it is possible to distinguish between obstructive and nonobstructive sleep apnea, and the decisions for an adequate treatment can be made.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

Patients with acute or chronic pain often complain of difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, shorter sleep duration, unrefreshing sleep, and poor sleep quality in general. According to the majority of the experimental human studies, sleep deprivation may produce hyperalgesic changes. The selective disruption of slow wave sleep has shown this effect more consistently, while results after selective REM sleep deprivation remain unclear. Patients with chronic pain have a marked alteration of sleep structure and continuity, such as frequent sleep-stage shifts, increased nocturnal awakenings, decreased slow wave sleep (SWS), decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and alpha-delta sleep. Many analgesic medications can alter sleep architecture in a manner similar to the effects of acute and chronic pain, suppressing SWS and REM sleep.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint.

Common evening and night time disorders also include restless legs syndrome and associated periodic limb movements of sleep. Screening questions often help to identify the sleep problem that you are dealing with (box 1). Thereafter, sleep problems are best characterised on the basis of a thorough history. A collateral history from the bed partner is often helpful to define any restless legs, sleepwalking or parasomnia, snoring, and breathing abnormalities. Discussing the patient’s ideas about sleep, any concerns they might have, and their expectations of normal sleep is often worth while. #### Box 1: Sleep history questions",

They can arise either from external causes (such as shift-work or jet-lag) or as a result of internal changes promoting abnormal sleep behaviour. Structuring daily activities by paying attention to natural daylight (dawn and dusk) and to the social routine strengthen the synchronizing effect of external timekeepers necessary for the concordance between inner and outer rhythmic phenomena. Treatment of chronobiological sleep/wake-cycle disturbances require correct diagnosis and modification of their causes, particularly changes in habits consolidating such disturbances. Early recognition of a chronobiological sleep disorder can reduce the risk of misuse of sleeping pills, caffeine and nicotine.

      "abstract": "The human voice undergoes changes over the life span associated with normal development and aging and/or pathological changes in subsystems responsible for voice and speech production (respiration, phonation and articulation). Each change does not immediately indicate presence of the voice disorder. Vocal aging generally begins after the age of approximately 65 years as part of a normal physiological aging. Voice disorders in elderly can be result of the aging process itself or may be caused by some kind of illness or pathological process. Presbyphonia is a term used to describe changes in vocal quality associated with aging process, and presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related changes of the larynx results in presbyphonia. These diagnoses can be made only after careful multidisciplinary examination and exclusion of other pathological changes and possible causes of voice disorder. Some of the symptoms of presbyphonia are changes in vocal pitch, reduced loudness, increased breathiness and hoarsness, weakness of the voice, vocal tremor, inability to sustain phonation and reduced vocal quality. The impact of voice disorders in elderly has been shown to cut across a number of quality-of-life domains such as social interaction, general and emotional health, and psychological well-being. The number of people above the age of 65 is increasing rapidly worldwide and the issue of recognizing and treating voice disorders in this population is becoming increasingly important. Therapy of presbyphonia must be multidisciplinary. Vocal therapy is considered as first method of choice and its efficiency is proven by current researches. Surgical approaches are used if vocal therapy is not showing expected results.\r\nGoal of this review is to present basic information about aging and normal biological changes in the human body caused by the aging process and to show how this changes affect voice quality in the elderly. Furthermore, prevalence and incidence, definition and causes of voice disorders in elderly are shown by presenting results of the recent researches. This paper also describes diagnostic procedures and current treatments for voice disorders in elderly and addresses its efficiency.",

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Development in Adults and Older Adults",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter reviews age-related changes in sleep, circadian rhythms, and sleep disorders in adults and older adults. With advancing age there are major changes in sleep, including sleep timing, the amount of slow-wave sleep, the number of nocturnal awakenings, sleep consolidation, and total sleep time. There are also changes in circadian rhythmicity with aging, including a reduced amplitude of some circadian rhythms and some evidence for reduced sensitivity to light. The interaction between the sleep and circadian regulatory systems also changes with age, resulting in greater difficulty sleeping during the biological daytime, the nocturnal sleep episode occurring at earlier circadian phases than in young adults, and a reduced ability to obtain a long and consolidated sleep episode. In addition to these general changes in sleep and circadian rhythmicity with aging, the sleep of many older people is impacted by a higher prevalence of specific sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movements of sleep, and rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder; and they are also more likely to have chronic medical problems that interfere with sleep and to take medications that either disrupt nighttime sleep or impact daytime alertness.",

Under all specified conditions, intensive audiogenic clonic or clonic-tonic convulsions caused long-lasting and pronounced sleep disorders in rats associated with disorganization of the mechanisms of starting the fast-wave sleep phase in the first place. But after experimental deprivations of sleep the audiogenic paroxysmal seizures run only as initial motor excitement without obvious convulsions. Such sort of seizures promote a faster beginning of recovery process after deprivations and did not cause any disorganization of the function of the brain systems responsible for starting and shaping (maintenance) fast-wave sleep.",

      "abstract": "Disturbed sleep cycles are the principal cause of institutionalization in dementia, and therefore represent a major clinical problem. They may arise from dysfunction within the circadian clock of the hypothalamus that times and consolidates wakefulness, or from neuropathology in output pathways and/or target sites of the clock specifically controlling sleep and wakefulness. To determine the relationship of disturbed activity cycles to other circadian clock‐controlled rhythms, cross‐sectional and longitudinal actigraphy and serial sampling of saliva were used to compare the impact of early Alzheimer's dementia on activity/rest and cortisol rhythms in home‐dwelling subjects. Mildly demented subjects had daily activity rhythms comparable to those of healthy age‐matched subjects. Moderately demented subjects exhibited a range of disturbances of the activity/rest cycle, with reduced stability, increased fragmentation and loss of amplitude. Within the moderately demented group, however, the degree of circadian disruption was not correlated with the individual severity of dementia. All groups of subjects, mild, moderate with normal activity cycles and moderate with abnormal activity cycles, exhibited robust daily profiles of salivary cortisol, with highest levels in the morning (08:00 h) and an evening nadir (20:00–24:00 h). Salivary cortisol levels tended to be higher in the moderately demented subjects in the afternoon, but this effect was not specific to those with abnormal activity/rest patterns. The actimetric data confirm that deterioration of activity/rest cycles is a common and progressive feature in home‐dwelling Alzheimer's patients, occurring early in the disease but after the measurable onset of dementia. The maintenance of highly rhythmic daily cortisol profiles in association with disturbed activity profiles, both on an individual and on a group basis, demonstrates that loss of circadian control to activity/rest cycles is not a consequence of global circadian disruption in early dementia. Rather, pathology may develop in discrete elements of the circadian clockwork and/or its output systems that control activity/rest, sleep and wakefulness. Further characterization of this pathology will facilitate more effective management of sleep patterns in home‐dwelling demented patients.",

      "abstract": "Internal clock desynchronization and public health consequences. The internal clock which is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus is controled by genetic factors (clock genes) and environmental factors (light-dark and sleepwake alternations). Light is the major component of the clock control. Clock desynchronization occurs when the clock is no longer in phase with the environment resulting in a phase shift (phase advance or phase delay) which can produce fatigue, sleep and mood disorders. Chronic exposure to light at night results in a clock desynchronization with concomitant health issues. This paper reports on the effects of the chronic desynchronization experienced by shiftworkers and nightworkers (which is a public health issue) and also by a large number of children and adolescents who sleep for 7-8 h instead of 9-10 h per night in relation with their use at night of electronic media. This sleep debt can lead to fatigue, behavioral problems and poor academic achievement.Désynchronisation de l’horloge interne : des conséquences en santé publique. L’horloge interne, localisée dans les noyaux suprachiasmatiques de l’hypothalamus, est sous le contrôle de facteurs génétiques (les gènes d’horloge) et de facteurs environnementaux (les alternances de lumière-obscurité et de veille-sommeil). La lumière est l’élément déterminant du fonctionnement et de la régulation de l’horloge. L’horloge est désynchronisée lorsqu’il n’y a plus de relations de phase entre l’heure biologique (l’horloge) et l’heure astronomique (la montre). On observe alors un déplacement (en avance ou en retard) de la phase des rythmes circadiens conduisant à des troubles du sommeil, de l’humeur, et à de la fatigue, etc. L’exposition chronique à la lumière la nuit entraîne une désynchronisation avec les troubles décrits ci-dessus. Cet article rapporte, d’une part, les effets de la désynchronisation chronique des travailleurs postés et de nuit (une véritable question de santé publique) et, d’autre part, le nombre croissant d’enfants et adolescents qui dorment 7-8 heures par nuit au lieu des 9-10 heures en raison de l’utilisation abusive, tard le soir, de médias électroniques. Cette dette de sommeil entraîne fatigue, troubles comportementaux, mauvais résultats scolaires.",

The purpose of this review is to discuss circadian dysregulation and its potential long-term effects in cancer including lung tumor and mental illness including depression, anxiety. Loss of autonomous cells containing Bmal1 and Per2 (the core components of circadian rhythm) will increase growth and metabolism imbalance and increase in c-Myc levels.

Although many people tend to experience sleep disturbances on an occasional basis owing to stressful life situations, alterations in job schedules, traveling, and many other external influences, but when these issues occur regularly and become an impedance in the day-to-day activities, it may be suggestive of a sleeping disorder.

Sleep difficulties are linked to both physical and emotional problems. Sleep problems can both contribute to and exacerbate existing mental problems as well as serve as an important indicator of other mental health conditions.

      "abstract": "Les exigences operationnelles du metier de pilote sont susceptibles d'engendrer de la somnolence et des niveaux de charge mentale inadequats (i.e., trop faible ou trop eleve) au cours des vols. Les dettes de sommeil et les perturbations circadiennes liees a divers facteurs (e.g., longues periodes de services, horaires de travail irregulier, etc.) demandent aux pilotes de repousser sans cesse leurs limites biologiques. Par ailleurs, la charge de travail mental des pilotes presente de fortes variations au cours d'un vol : elevee au cours des phases critiques (i.e., decollage et atterrissage), elle devient tres reduite pendant les phases de croisiere. Lorsque la charge mentale devient trop elevee ou, a l'inverse, trop faible, les performances se degradent et des erreurs de pilotage peuvent apparaitre. La mise en oeuvre de methodes de detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale en temps quasi reel est un defi majeur pour le suivi et le controle de l'activite de pilotage. L'objectif de la these est de determiner si la voix humaine peut permettre de detecter d'une part, l'etat de somnolence et d'autre part, le niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Dans une premiere etude, la voix de participants a ete enregistree lors d'une tâche de lecture avant et apres une nuit de privation totale de sommeil (PTS). Les variations de l'etat de somnolence consecutives a la PTS ont ete evaluees au moyen de mesures auto-evaluatives et electrophysiologiques (ElectroEncephaloGraphie [EEG] et Potentiels Evoques [PEs]). Les resultats ont montre une variation significative apres la PTS de plusieurs parametres acoustiques lies : (a) a l'amplitude des impulsions glottiques (frequence de modulation d'amplitude), (b) a la forme du signal acoustique (longueur euclidienne du signal et ses caracteristiques associees) et (c) au spectre du signal des voyelles (rapport harmonique sur bruit, frequence du second formant, coefficient d'asymetrie, centre de gravite spectral, differences d'energie, pente spectrale et coefficients cepstraux a echelle Mel). La plupart des caracteristiques spectrales ont montre une sensibilite differente a la privation de sommeil en fonction du type de voyelles. Des correlations significatives ont ete mises en evidence entre plusieurs parametres acoustiques et plusieurs indicateurs objectifs (EEG et PEs) de l'etat de somnolence. Dans une seconde etude, le signal vocal a ete enregistre durant une tâche de rappel de listes de mots. La difficulte de la tâche etait manipulee en faisant varier le nombre de mots dans chaque liste (i.e., entre un et sept, correspondant a sept conditions de charge mentale). Le diametre pupillaire - qui est un indicateur objectif pertinent du niveau de charge mentale - a ete mesure simultanement avec l'enregistrement de la voix afin d'attester de la variation du niveau de charge mentale durant la tâche experimentale. Les resultats ont montre que des parametres acoustiques classiques (frequence fondamentale et son ecart type, shimmer, nombre de periodes et rapport harmonique sur bruit) et originaux (frequence de modulation d'amplitude et variations a court-terme de la longueur euclidienne du signal) ont ete particulierement sensibles aux variations de la charge mentale. Les variations de ces parametres acoustiques etaient correlees a celles du diametre pupillaire. L'ensemble des resultats suggere que les parametres acoustiques de la voix humaine identifies lors des experimentations pourraient representer des indicateurs pertinents pour la detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Les resultats ouvrent de nombreuses perspectives de recherche et d'applications dans le domaine de la securite des transports, notamment dans le secteur aeronautique.",

EEG irregularities of sleep are noticed yet in fetal stage. Children aged 0-1 year develop five phases of sleep: drowsiness, active sleep, sleep of middle depth, deep sleep, paradoxical REM sleep. Maturity of superficial sleep terminates by the 10th-12th month of life. The sleep of average depth and deep sleep terminate maturity by the 2nd month of life. Duration of paradoxical sleep increases considerably by the age 12th month and is divided into 2 stages. By the age of 12 months paradoxical sleep remains immature. In children of the same age with CNS disorder the structural composition of sleep changes: active sleep is prolonged, sleep of middle depth is not changed, deep sleep does not develop, paradoxical-REM sleep is atypical.",

      "abstract": "The results reviewed clearly demonstrate that shift work is associated with increased subjective, behavioral, and physiological sleepiness. Apparently, the effects are due to combined circadian and homeostatic (sleep loss) influences. Sleepiness is particularly pronounced during the night shift, and may terminate in actual incidents of falling asleep at work. In some occupations this clearly constitutes a hazard that may endanger human lives and have large economic consequences. These risks clearly involve a larger number of people and should be of great significance to society.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders: Disorders of Arousal?",
      "abstract": "In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism, the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues, overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date, it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "Sleep difficulties are often leading symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that untreated insomnia predicts the onset of mental health disorders. Other sleep disorders also often cause mood and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, overlapping symptoms of sleep apnea, a sleep disorder with undoubted public health significance, and depression merits special attention. Sleep disorders have profound effect on daytime functioning causing daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. These symptoms may severely affect both the quality of life of the patient and also the sleep and quality of life of their bedpartners and family members, as well. It is increasingly appreciated that the majority of medically ill patients suffer from sleep disorders and sleep complaints, which contribute to their impaired quality of life and clinical outcomes. “Sleep Health” is an important aspect of everyone's life but has a special relevance in mentally or medically ill patients. In our studies focusing on patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (moderate to severe chronic renal failure, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) we have found high prevalence of sleep disorders (insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep, Sleep apnea). We have shown that they are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, increased illness intrusiveness and worse quality of life. Furthermore, RLS predicted mortality of kidney transplant recipients.

      "title": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose of Review: The endogenous circadian rhythms are one of the cardinal processes that control sleep. They are self-sustaining biological rhythms with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours that may be entrained by external zeitgebers (German for time givers), such as light, exercise, and meal times. This article discusses the physiology of the circadian rhythms, their relationship to neurologic disease, and the presentation and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. Recent Findings: Classic examples of circadian rhythms include cortisol and melatonin secretion, body temperature, and urine volume. More recently, the impact of circadian rhythm on several neurologic disorders has been investigated, such as the timing of occurrence of epileptic seizures as well as neurobehavioral functioning in dementia. Further updates include a more in-depth understanding of the symptoms, consequences, and treatment of circadian sleep-wake disorders, which may occur because of extrinsic misalignment with clock time or because of intrinsic dysfunction of the brain. An example of extrinsic misalignment occurs with jet lag during transmeridian travel or with intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders such as advanced or delayed sleep-wake phase disorders. In advanced sleep-wake phase disorder, which is most common in elderly individuals, sleep onset and morning arousal are undesirably early, leading to impaired evening function with excessive sleepiness and sleep-maintenance insomnia with early morning awakening. By contrast, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder is characterized by an inability to initiate sleep before the early morning hours, with subsequent delayed rise time, leading to clinical symptoms of severe sleep-onset insomnia coupled with excessive daytime sleepiness in the morning hours, as patients are unable to “sleep in” to attain sufficient sleep quantity. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder is misentrainment with patches of brief sleep and wakefulness spread throughout the day, leading to unstable sleep and waking behavioral patterns and an entirely idiosyncratic sleep-wake schedule. Summary: Familiarity with these major circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder phenotypes and their overlap with other neurologic disorders is essential for the neurologist so that clinicians may intervene and improve patient functioning and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Sleep is paramount in bipolar affective disorder and sleep disturbance can be a trigger or initial manifestation of an episode of illness. Changes in the circadian rhythm in bipolar affective disorder have consistently been recognized and reported, however, this feature can be overlooked in daily clinical practice. Objectives We aim to review and summarize the literature regarding changes in circadian rhythm in patients with bipolar affective disorder. Methods We performed an updated review in the PubMed database using the terms “circadian rhythm” and “bipolar affective disorder”. Results Irregularity of the sleep–wake rhythm, eveningness chronotype, abnormality of melatonin secretion, vulnerability of clock genes, and the irregularity of social time cues are circadian rhythm markers disrupted in bipolar affective disorder. Circadian rhythm dysfunction might be a trait marker of this illness and can act as a predictor for the first onset of bipolar affective disorder and the relapse of mood episodes. Achieving normalization of circadian rhythm in combination with pharmacological, psychosocial and chronobiological treatments can be a tool for managing bipolar affective disorder. Conclusions Recognizing patterns of changes in circadian rhythms is important to detect and diagnose bipolar disorder in clinical practice, also affecting treatment. These alterations are often overlooked and can lead to inadequate treatment and management.",

      "abstract": "Excessive stress gives rise to disturbances in various systems in humans and activates defense mechanisms to maintain homeostasis in the body. Sleep is an essential biological process of which the underlying regulating mechanism involves numerous anatomical structures and biochemical substances that can be compromised by stress and the immune system. Immune sub-stances such as interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor are related to the homeostatic process of sleep. Interleukin-1β interacts by being involved in an immune regulating feedback chain that activates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis which, in turn, is related to the circadian process. Moreover, stress-induced insomnia activates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis further to bring about a vicious cycle of stress and insomnia. The pathophysiological theory responsible for chronic insomnia is that of stressdiathesis, which is a series of processes consisting of predisposition, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. In clinical practice, as the process in which stressinduced insomnia passes into a chronic course is directly related to treatment, the understanding of perpetuating factors is indispensable. Sleep disturbance is a very common complaint among pa-tients with posttraumatic stress disorder. Increased noradrenergic activity and REM sleep dysregul-ation seem to have a role in mediating sleep disturbances of this disorder. Sleep disturbance must always be taken into account as an important clinical variable whenever evaluating or managing stress.",

Other parameters exclusively underlie the ultradian influence of state, i.e.wake state vs. sleep state, or the rhythmic sleep process with cyclically returning stages of NREM 1-4 sleep and REM sleep. Long-term blood pressure and ECG recordings show a circadian pattern of blood pressure and heart rate. At night, blood pressure physiologically decreases by 10-15% which is referred to as dipping. Non-dipping is prognostically adversarial. In addition, the mean heart rate drops at night. Blood pressure and heart rate are modulated according to the sleep stages. At the transition from wake to sleep, blood pressure and heart rate decrease in trend reaching the lowest values during deep sleep. During REM sleep, blood pressure and heart rate exhibit pronounced changes, thereby generating a nightly recurring stress test for the cardiovascular system. Circadian and ultradian rhythms influence endocrine parameters as well as hydromineral balance and renal function. Cortisol secretion exhibits a characteristic circadian rhythm pattern. Adversely, renin secretion for example is strongly related to sleep stage control.",

      "abstract": "The worldwide prevalence of sleep disorders is approximately 50%, with an even higher occurrence in a psychiatric population. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe mental illness characterized by shifts in mood and activity. The BD syndrome also involves heterogeneous symptomatology, including cognitive dysfunctions and impairments of the autonomic nervous system. Sleep abnormalities are frequently associated with BD and are often a good predictor of a mood swing. Preservation of stable sleep-wake cycles is therefore a key to the maintenance of stability in BD, indicating the crucial role of circadian rhythms in this syndrome. The symptom most widespread in BD is insomnia, followed by excessive daytime sleepiness, nightmares, difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, poor sleep quality, sleep talking, sleep walking, and obstructive sleep apnea. Alterations in the structure or duration of sleep are reported in all phases of BD. Understanding the role of neuroglia in BD and in various aspects of sleep is in nascent state. Contributions of the different types of glial cells to BD and sleep abnormalities are discussed in this paper.",

      "title": "Effects of acute and chronic sleep deprivation on cardiovascular regulation",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a fundamental physiological process, characterized by the activation of several cortical and subcortical neural networks. The relation between sleep and cardiovascular system is complex and bidirectional: sleep disor- ders may alter cardiovascular system, leading to an increased cardiovascular risk, while, on the contrary, cardio- vascular diseases are characterized by an alteration of physiological sleep. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a key role in the regulation of cardiovascular functions during different sleep stages, with sympatho-vagal balance dynamically shifting towards sympathetic or vagal predominance across different sleep stages. Sleep deprivation (SD) has becoming one of the most relevant health problem in modern societies. SD can be related to aging, which is associated with increased sleep fragmentation, and to sleep disorders, such as sleep disordered breathing and neurological disorders. Experimental studies in animals showed that SD significantly affects cardiovascular functions, altering heart rate and blood pressure responses, and increasing sympathetic activity and neuroendocrine response to stressor stimu- li. Clinical studies in humans have shown that SD, either due to experimental sleep loss and to sleep disorders, can affect different biological pathways, such as cardiovascular autonomic control, inflammation, immunity responses and metabolism. All these alterations may predispose subjects with SD to an increased cardiovascular risk. Hence, it is fundamental to identify the presence of a sleep disorder, which could be per se responsible for sleep loss, or the presence of sleep deprivation due to other factors, such as social life, habits etc., in order to identify subjects at high risk for cardiovascular events.",

      "title": "Effects of acute and chronic sleep deprivation on cardiovascular regulation",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a fundamental physiological process, characterized by the activation of several cortical and subcortical neural networks. The relation between sleep and cardiovascular system is complex and bidirectional: sleep disor- ders may alter cardiovascular system, leading to an increased cardiovascular risk, while, on the contrary, cardio- vascular diseases are characterized by an alteration of physiological sleep. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a key role in the regulation of cardiovascular functions during different sleep stages, with sympatho-vagal balance dynamically shifting towards sympathetic or vagal predominance across different sleep stages. Sleep deprivation (SD) has becoming one of the most relevant health problem in modern societies. SD can be related to aging, which is associated with increased sleep fragmentation, and to sleep disorders, such as sleep disordered breathing and neurological disorders. Experimental studies in animals showed that SD significantly affects cardiovascular functions, altering heart rate and blood pressure responses, and increasing sympathetic activity and neuroendocrine response to stressor stimu- li. Clinical studies in humans have shown that SD, either due to experimental sleep loss and to sleep disorders, can affect different biological pathways, such as cardiovascular autonomic control, inflammation, immunity responses and metabolism. All these alterations may predispose subjects with SD to an increased cardiovascular risk. Hence, it is fundamental to identify the presence of a sleep disorder, which could be per se responsible for sleep loss, or the presence of sleep deprivation due to other factors, such as social life, habits etc., in order to identify subjects at high risk for cardiovascular events.",

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder in which a person frequently stops breathing during his or her sleep. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is the average number of disordered breathing events per hour. Typically, OSA syndrome is defined as an AHI of 5 or greater with associated symptoms (e.g.: excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or impaired cognition) or an AHI of 15 or greater, regardless of associated symptoms.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

Sleeping is mandatory for the physical, emotional and mental health of children and adults. Sleep related problems are one of the most frequent reason parents ask for a pediatrician’s help. Although parents are more concerned about the child’s sleep than other processes of a child’s development, in general they do not know enough about sleep hygiene and healthy sleeping habits. Even though the prevalence of sleep disorders in children is high, it is often overlooked by healthcare professionals. From around the world we receive data how adolescents do not get enough restful sleep, leading to cognitive, social and health problems. Behavioral sleep disorders are directly related to sleep hygiene which treatment requires affect changes in behavior as well as providing optimal environmental conditions.

      "abstract": "La douleur est une cause majeure de l'insomnie chez les malades et plus de 70% des patients en douleur se plaignent de troubles du sommeil. Des études polysomnographiques ont démontré que les patients éprouvant de la douleur chronique affichent une perturbation marquée de la structure et de la continuité du sommeil. Les constatations les plus courantes sont: changements fréquents de phases de sommeil, augmentation des réveils nocturnes, diminution du sommeil à ondes lentes et du sommeil à mouvements oculaires rapides, augmentation du sommeil superficiel et des mouvements du corps, intrusion électroencéphalographique (EEG) de sommeil alpha-delta, augmentation du nombre d'éveils et du taux de pattern d'activation cyclique (PAC). Le PAC est un marqueur physiologique du sommeil instable qui amplifie les réactions aux événements perturbateurs de la consolidation du sommeil. Ainsi, la qualité du sommeil dépend de mécanismes cérébraux qui évaluent les événements externes afin de protéger l'intégrité vitale. Ces mécanismes, situés au niveau thalamique, commande le maintien du sommeil, l'éveil bref ou le réveil comportemental, selon le risque que représente l'événement en cause. Pendant le sommeil, le système neurovégétatif demeure réceptif aux stimuli externes et opère en synchronie avec le processus PAC. Chez les sujets sains, la stimulation thermique nociceptive provoque une accélération du rythme cardiaque peu importe la phase du sommeil, avec un gradient décroissant de la phase 2 au sommeil à ondes lentes et au sommeil MOR. Les réponses autonomiques peuvent varier chez les patients fibromyalgiques n'affichant pas la diminution normale de l'activité sympathique pendant le sommeil et chez les patients éprouvant de la douleur chronique qui sont déjà aux prises avec la fragmentation du sommeil ou l'insomnie. Les modifications spécifiques du sommeil découlant d'un syndrome unique de douleur ou de parasomnies associées à la douleur pendant le sommeil (par ex. le bruxisme, les crampes nocturnes dans les jambes et le reflux gastro-œsophagien) sont également décrites.",

      "abstract": "Neuroendocrine mechanisms are major determinants of the normal 24-h blood pressure (BP) pattern. At the central level, integration of the major driving factors of this temporal variability is mediated by circadian rhythms of monoaminergic systems in conjunction with those of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid, opioid, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, plus endothelial systems and specific vasoactive peptides. Humoral secretions are typically episodic, coupled either to sleep and/or the circadian endogenous (suprachiasmatic nucleus) central pacemaker clock, but exhibiting also weekly, monthly, seasonal, and annual periodicities. Sleep induction and arousal are influenced also by many hormones and chemical substances that exhibit 24-h variation, e.g., arginine vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, melatonin, somatotropin, insulin, steroids, serotonin, corticotropin-releasing factor, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, endogenous opioids, and prostaglandin E2, all with established effects on the cardiovascular system. As a consequence, physical, mental, and pathologic stimuli that activate or inhibit neuroendocrine effectors of biological rhythmicity may also interfere with, or modify, the temporal BP structure. Moreover, immediate adjustment to exogenous components/environment demands by BP rhythms is modulated by the circadian-time-dependent responsiveness of biological oscillators and their neuroendocrine effectors. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of abnormalities of the 24-h BP pattern and level and their correction through circadian rhythm-based chronotherapeutic strategies.

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

These episodes of hypoxia or apnea can lead to tissue inflammation, and are causal factors of disturbed sleep in both men and women. Several lines of evidence suggest that sleep patterns differ along the lifespan in both male and female subjects, and this may result from the influence of female gonadotropic hormones on sleep. Compared to men, women have more sleep complaints, as women's sleep is not only influenced by gonadotropins, but also by conditions related to these hormones, such as pregnancy. It is therefore not surprising that sleep disturbances are seen during menopause, too. Factors that may play a role in this type of SDB in women include vasomotor symptoms, changing reproductive hormone levels, circadian rhythm abnormalities, mood disorders, coexistent medical conditions, and lifestyle factors.",

REM sleep is often called dreaming (or D) sleep, because dreams are reported by about 70–80% of persons awakened during this period. REM sleep also is referred to as paradoxical sleep, because the brain paradoxically seems to be in an activated state that is similar to, but not identical to, the waking state. REM sleep is characterized by an activated electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (low‐voltage, fast‐frequency brain waves), muscular paralysis (with the exception of diaphragmatic and ocular muscles), periodic bursts of rapid eye movements, and autonomic nervous system instability (e.g., variable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration). Brain metabolism is normal or slightly increased during REM sleep.",

This chapter describes the common changes in sleep that occur in aging, and the factors that contribute to such changes. Older adults frequently experience poor sleep, which can be caused by age-related changes in sleep architecture and circadian rhythms, elevated rates of sleep disorders, complex comorbid conditions, and lifestyle changes associated with aging. Specific sleep disorders that are common in older adults, particularly sleep apnea and insomnia disorder are discussed. The links between sleep and specific physical and mental health in older adults are described, with particular focus on the interactions of sleep disturbance with cognition, cardiovascular diseases, and risk of falls in older adults.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is one of the key underpinnings of human health, yet sleep disturbances and impaired sleep are rampant in modern life. Healthy sleep is a whole-body process impacted by circadian rhythm, daily activities, and emotional well-being, among others. When properly aligned, these work in concert to produce restorative and refreshing sleep. When not in balance, however, sleep disorders result. Yet too often, the approach to treatment of sleep disorders is compartmentalized, failing to recognize all of the complex interactions that are involved. This text offers a comprehensive approach to sleep and sleep disorders by delineating the many factors that interplay into healthy sleep. Health care providers can learn how to better manage their patients with sleep disorders by integrating complementary and conventional approaches. Using an evidence-based approach throughout, this book describes the basics of normal sleep then delves into the foundations of integrative sleep medicine, including the circadian rhythm, mind/body-sleep connection, light, dreaming, the gastrointestinal system, and botanicals/supplements. Specific sleep issues and disorders are then addressed from an integrative perspective, including insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, sleep related movement disorders, and parasomnias.",

The derangement of one or more of the physiological processes can result in a number of sleep disturbances such as insomnia, sleep apnea, circadian rhythm disorders, narcolepsy, and parasomnias. Excessive daytime sleepiness is common in individuals experiencing sleep disturbances. The general view of sleep regulation is that two main processes are integrated to control the amount and timing of sleep. Given the heterogenous state of the sleep/wake cycle, supplying an answer to the simple question as to why an organism sleeps is very complex, and several theories have been proposed. Several studies have evaluated the sleep-inducing and sleep-promoting effects of various H3 receptor agonists. Sleep apnea syndrome is characterized by frequent, repetitive disruptions in respiration during sleep, resulting in excessive arousal from sleep.",

      "title": "Circadian aspects in the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia",
      "abstract": "Summary Because the endogenous circadian pacemaker is a very strong determinant of alertness/sleep propensity across the 24 h period, its mistiming may contribute to symptoms of insomnia (e.g., difficulties initiating sleep and maintaining sleep) and to the development of insomnia disorder. Despite the separation of insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders in diagnostic nosology implying independent pathophysiology, there is considerable evidence of co‐morbidity and interaction between them. Sleep onset insomnia is associated with later timed circadian rhythms and can be treated with morning bright light to shift rhythms to an earlier timing. It is also possible that the causal link may go in both directions and that having a delayed circadian rhythm can result in enough experiences of delayed sleep onset to lead to some conditioned insomnia or insomnia disorder further exacerbating a delayed circadian rhythm. Early morning awakening insomnia is associated with an advanced circadian phase (early timing) and can be treated with evening bright light resulting in a delay of rhythms and an improved ability to sleep later in the morning and to obtain more sleep. There is some evidence suggesting that sleep maintenance insomnia is associated with a blunted amplitude of circadian rhythm that may be treated with increased regularity of sleep and light exposure timing. However, this is an insomnia phenotype that requires considerably more circadian research as well as further insomnia clinical research with the other insomnia phenotypes incorporating circadian timing measures and treatments.",

Physiologic sleep is simply a period of resting for all our organs, their functions being markedly lowered, central control diminished, and changes of reconstruction occurring in our nervous equilibrium. The nervous patient sleeps badly, but the nature of the insomnia varies in many ways. Some go to sleep the moment they lie down, only to awake an hour or two later, to toss throughout the night, and possibly to doze off at the hour when they should awake. Others sleep well till the first peep of day, rising ill-humored and cross, having lost two of their nine hours' sleep. Some patients apparently never sleep and remain calm and comfortable the entire night, get very restless and provoked, get up and walk around",

We incidentally found an isolated, marked increase in REM sleep time (200 min, 40% of total sleep time, normative values: 18.2-20.3%) and in rapid eye movements density during REM sleep in a patient with a secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, associated with an anterior pontine demyelinating lesion on magnetic resonance imaging.

Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Mental stress is a major issue in today’s competitive environment. Insomnia, memory issues, depression, and other disorders can all be caused by a lack of sleep. Frustration, irritation, and a higher risk of heart disease are all symptoms of stress. Anxiety, inability to concentrate, and car accidents etc. The majority of individuals only sleep for 3-4 hours each day, which is insufficient. Enough. People should sleep for roughly 6-7 hours every day in reality. To alleviate this problem, many people utilize high doses of drugs. This is an issue that is extremely detrimental to the humanbody. There are several options available. Therapy options for insomnia is also there. Yoursleep cycle is regulated by aninternal “body clock” that controls when you feel weary and ready for bed or refreshed and awake which is known as cardiac rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle that this clock follows. You will grow progressively fatigued during the day after waking up from sleep. These emotions will peak in the evening, just before bedtime. Adenosine, anorganic substance generated in the brain, linked to sleep drive, also known as sleep-wake homeostasis. As you get extra weary throughout the day, your adenosine levels rise, and your body subsequently breaks down this chemical while yousleep. The circadian rhythm is also influenced by light. The hypothalamus is a particular area of nerve cellsin the brain,and the suprachiasmatic nucleus is a cluster of cells in the hypothalamus that processes signals when the eyes are exposed to natural or artificial light. The brain uses these signals to decide whether it is day or night. As natural light fades in the evening, the body produces melatonin, a drowsiness-inducing hormone. The hormone cortisol, which increases energy and alertness, is released when the sun rises in the morning. Most individuals require at least seven hours of sleep each night in order to operate well cognitively and behaviorally. An inadequate quantity of sleep might have catastrophic consequences. Sleep deprivation has been linked to attention lapses, impaired cognition, delayed responses, and mood swings in certain studies.",

There are multifactorial causes involved in the aetiology of childhood insomnia. In order to understand and diagnose insomnia in childhood it is necessary to have a good knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the genesis of sleeping and waking. We must also take the possible existence of other types of disorders into consideration. Insomnia appears as an imbalance between the systems that maintain the waking state and those that are in charge of activating sleep generating systems. In children, this imbalance depends on the state of functional immaturity peculiar to each age. Rather than a shortage of sleep, childhood insomnia takes the form of a lack of matching between the child s own rhythm or need to sleep and his or her family or social environment. Insomnia is most frequently caused by environmental, behavioural and psychological factors. A correct diagnosis of childhood insomnia has to be based on determining a procedure to differentiate it from parasomnias or motor disorders affecting waking and sleep.Identifying the causes of childhood insomnia, differentiating it from real insomnia and other sleep disorders, and resolving it are no simple matter because of the influence exerted by the environment and the child s behaviour on how he or she sleeps.",

      "abstract": "1. Although nighttime awakenings are common in the second half year and beyond, this is not a developmental necessity; rather, most normal infants gain the capacity to \"sleep through the night\" by 6 months of age. 2. There is not a single cause of (or a single treatment for) nighttime awakenings and crying; many factors may be responsible, and these must be identified and individually treated if there is to be resolution. 3. What are often perceived as abnormal awakenings are really only the normal awakenings associated with normal sleep stage cycling, and, parents' \"treatment\" of these awakenings with interventions, such as rocking or feeding, only make it more difficult for the child to go back to sleep without them after subsequent awakenings. 4. No evaluation of a sleepless child is complete without a thorough understanding of the child's daily schedule. The child's sleep schedule may be consistent and his sleep normal, and only the timing may be shifted from that desired by the parents. The bedtime difficulties or early morning awakenings generated in this setting may be handled inappropriately by the family, creating even more complicated problems. Or, the schedule may be irregular, sleep/wake rhythms may not adjust, and any of a variety of apparent sleep disorders may appear.",

However, long-term exposure to stress leading to sickness absence may result in profoundly disturbed sleep.

Delta or slow wave sleep is characterized by high voltage, slow waves. The increasing presence of large delta waves indicates the onset of delta sleep. Waking the sleeper is most difficult at this time; hence, delta sleep is considered the deepest stage of sleep. The physiology of the body during rapid eye movement (REM) is quite different from that during non- REM (NREM). The stages of sleep in the average young adult show a fairly regular cyclic alteration. Environmental influences such as daylight, traffic noises, and the activity of other people tend to make prolonged sleep more difficult. The relationship between length of prior wakefulness and the amount of delta that follows is direct.",

Respiratory dysfunction in sleep is common in persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI), occurring at a significantly higher rate than in the general population. Regulation of sleep is mediated by opposing actions of the anterior and posterior/lateral regions of the hypothalamus. Insomnia is characterized as difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep, awakening in morning, or non-restorative sleep. The negative effects of shift work include sleepiness and insomnia, reduced alertness, and greater risk of re-injury, overall poor health, low work productivity, and poor quality of life. The sleep diary has been used in the TBI population for assessing sleep quality and quantity, and for identifying factors that may affect sleep and wakefulness. Sleep in TBI represents something of a challenge to investigate because of the broad array of possible diagnoses for the manifested problems.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

It is possible that the temporal overlapping of a constellation of factors may act as favouring and/or triggering factors for the onset of several acute diseases. Among these, epistaxis shows a circadian variability too. Such pattern, characterised by a prevalent peak in the morning and a secondary one in the evening, strictly resembles that of arterial blood pressure. The lack of differences between the temporal pattern of hypertensive and normotensive subjects suggests that the physiological pattern of blood pressure, and not strictly a condition of hypertension, may play a favouring role in certain hours of the day, probably together other local factors.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders, a common concern in modern society, seriously affect people's physical and mental health. Reported findings suggest that both acute exercise intervention and long-term regular exercise intervention can improve the disrupted sleep structure and normalize the duration and proportion of the different phases of sleep. Moreover, exercise intervention has a positive effect on the endocrine functions, the metabolic functions, the immune response, the autonomic nervous system, and cardiac functions during sleep. It is a non-medicative therapeutic strategy for improving sleep disorders. The specific type of exercise intervention (aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or meditative movement) adopted is one of the moderating variables of exercise intervention programs. Different types of exercise improve sleep disorders by way of different mechanisms. Exercise volume and intensity are another moderating variable of exercise intervention programs. The optimal amount and intensity of exercise for different individuals to improve sleep disorders may vary. Exercise interventions implemented at the different times throughout a day can also have varying degrees of impact on sleep disorders and there is no consensus on the optimal exercise time for improving sleep quality at present. Herein, we summarized the mechanisms by which exercise intervention improves sleep disorders from four perspectives, including epigenetics, hyperarousal, human circadian rhythm, and body temperature regulation. In addition, we discussed the current gaps and prospects of research in this field, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the development of exercise prescriptions for sleep disorders.",

These rhythms are spontaneously generated by an internal \"pacemaker\" in the hypothalamus, and daily light exposure to the eyes is required to keep these circadian rhythms synchronized both internally and with the external environment Sighted individuals take this daily synchronization process for granted, although they experience some of the consequences of circadian desynchrony when \"jetlagged\" or working night shifts. Most blind people with no perception of light, however, experience continual circadian desynchrony through a failure of light information to reach the hypothalamic circadian clock, resulting in cyclical episodes of poor sleep and daytime dysfunction. Daily melatonin administration, which provides a replacement synchronizing daily \"time cue,\" is a promising therapeutic strategy, although optimal treatment dose and timing remain to be determined.",

      "title": "Understanding Circadian Rhythms: Implications for Nursing Practice",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are 24-hour biological cycles that regulate various physiological processes, including sleep-wake cycles, hormone secretion, metabolism, and immune function. These rhythms are controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus and are influenced by environmental cues such as light and temperature. Disruption of circadian rhythms, caused by factors like shift work, jet lag, or irregular sleep patterns, can lead to significant health consequences, including sleep disorders, metabolic dysfunction, mental health disturbances, and immune impairments. For nurses, understanding circadian rhythms is crucial in both patient care and their own professional practice. Hospitalized patients often experience circadian misalignment due to artificial lighting, noise, and irregular medical interventions. This misalignment can hinder recovery, exacerbate symptoms, and reduce the effectiveness of treatments. Nurses themselves are at risk of circadian disruption due to shift work, which can lead to fatigue, burnout, and increased risks of errors and chronic health issues. This article highlights the importance of integrating circadian rhythm considerations into nursing practice. It provides strategies to promote circadian alignment, including optimizing sleep hygiene, timing medications based on biological rhythms, and utilizing light therapy. For nursing professionals, implementing forward-rotating shifts, strategic napping, and wellness programs can mitigate the adverse effects of circadian misalignment. Emerging research and innovations, such as chronomedicine, wearable technologies, and circadian lighting systems, hold promise for improving patient outcomes and supporting nursing staff. By leveraging these advancements, nursing professionals can enhance care quality while safeguarding their own health. This article underscores the vital role of circadian rhythms in nursing, advocating for evidence-based interventions to optimize patient recovery and professional well-being.",

      "title": "Insomnia – A Heterogenic Disorder Often Comorbid With Psychological and Somatic Disorders and Diseases: A Narrative Review With Focus on Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges",
      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "abstract": "Major sleep disorders, independent of whether the dominant complaint is excessive daytime sleepiness or initiating or maintaining sleep, include a sleep deprivation component. Awakenings and arousals were defined based on electroencephalographic recordings using central leads. Some investigators tried to define \"awakenings\" behaviorally by analyzing continuous video recordings. Periodic limb movement disorder, originally described by Symonds as \"nocturnal myoclonus\", was questioned as being an epileptic equivalent. Restless legs syndrome is a dysesthesia that presents an important circadian relationship. Objective evaluations of the consequences of the sleep fragmentation are few in number. Most of them have been performed through studies of sleep-disordered breathing syndromes: upper airway resistance syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Insomnias are a cause of sleep deprivation. Menopause is also associated with sleep disruption. Often the reaction to this component will lead to a worsening of abnormal sleep, impacting on sleep hygiene, circadian timing of sleep-wake, and/or conditioning against sleep.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

      "title": "Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder Revisited – A Case Study",
      "abstract": "The human sleep-wake cycle is governed by two major factors: a homeostatic hourglass process (process S), which rises linearly during the day, and a circadian process C, which determines the timing of sleep in an approximately 24h rhythm in accordance to the external light-dark (LD) cycle. While both individual processes are fairly well characterized, the exact nature of their interaction remains unclear. The circadian rhythm is generated by the subthalamic nucleus (SCN, \"master clock\") of the anterior hypothalamus, through cell-autonomous feedback loops of DNA transcription and translation. While the phase length (tau) of the cycle is relatively stable and genetically determined, the phase of the clock is reset by external stimuli (\"zeitgebers\"), the most important being the LD-cycle. Misalignments of the internal rhythm with the LD-cycle can lead to various somatic complaints and ultimately to the development of circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD). Non-24-h sleep-wake disorders (N24HSWD) is a CRSD affecting up to 50% of totally blind patients and characterized by the inability to maintain a stable entrainment of the typically long circadian rhythm (tau >24.5h) to the LD- cycle. The disease is rare (<1:1 Mio) in sighted individuals and the pathophysiology less well understood. Here we present the case of a 40 year old sighted male, who developed a misalignment of the internal clock with the external light-dark cycle following the treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma (ABVD regimen, 4 cycles and AVD regimen, 4 cycles). A thorough clinical assessment including actigraphy, melatonin profiles, polysomnography and wake-EEG lead to the diagnosis of a non-24-h sleep-wake disorders (N24HSWD) with a free-running rhythm of tau=25.5h. A therapeutic intervention with bright-light therapy (BLT, 30 min 10.000lux) in the morning and melatonin administration (0.5-0.75 mg) in the evening failed to entrain the free-running rhythm, although a longer treatment duration and more intense therapy might have been successful. The sudden onset and close timely connection led us to hypothesize that the chemotherapy might have caused a mutation of the molecular clock components leading to the observed elongation of the circadian period.",

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

List the most important factor associated with SIDS.\n\n5. List other factors contributing to SIDS.\n\nMost SIDS deaths occur during a narrow developmental window of 1 to 4 months postnatal age, a period when significant changes occur in sleep and circadian rhythms organization and in the modulation of brainstem and cortical centers involved in cardiovascular/respiratory and arousal state control. There is consensus that SIDS typically occurs during sleep periods, but it is unclear whether SIDS occurs during sleep itself, within transitions between sleep and waking, or between sleep states. Nevertheless, the link between the peak occurrence of SIDS and the period of major sleep developmental changes suggests that SIDS is state-related and involves abnormal interactions between the state-modulated arousal threshold and central regulatory mechanisms of cardiovascular/respiratory control. It also is generally agreed that infants who are at risk for SIDS may have central nervous system abnormalities at birth that may be too subtle to detect clinically. Most of the SIDS pathology data show abnormalities in the brainstem and hypothalamus, areas involved in sleep, arousal, central cardiovascular/respiratory control, and circadian rhythms. Among the most notable changes in sleep and circadian rhythms occurring between 1 and 4 months of age, both in term and preterm (corrected age) infants, are: 1) an increase in the percentage and episode length of quiet sleep (QS), 2) sleep onset changes from rapid eye movement or …",

Though metabolism slows during sleep, major organs and other regulatory functions continue. Sleep inertia can be thought of as that period of grogginess that is often experienced upon awakening. It is a transitional state between sleep and wake and is associated with lower arousal and performance levels. Sleep drive is a homeostatic process that is responsive to wake duration. The biological pressure for sleep builds over the wake period. Sleep loss can be categorized into three different types, depending on the length of the sleep loss and the magnitude of its effects: acute, cumulative and chronic. Fatigue and sleepiness can be used to describe a similar physiological state, although the use of fatigue is more prevalent in operational environments and sleepiness is more commonly used by sleep specialists. Maintaining optimal alertness and neurobehavioral functioning in operational environments is critical to maintaining safety, efficiency and success.",

Some disturbances of the circadian system are responsible for clinical syndromes characterized by chrono-fatigue, one of them being the sleep delayed phase insomnia. Circadian sleep disorders, either functional or structural, are characterized not only by disturbances in sleep architecture and/or sleep quality, but also by the inability to fall asleep and stay awake at desired times. Similarly, sleep and fatigue present in those circadian disorders typically exhibit a daily cyclic pattern. Night workers and shift workers do have chronic sleep deprivation and desynchronisation of their circadian system with the entraining environment. Those phenomena are responsible for severe vigilance problems, a decrease in work productivity and deleterious health side effects. Fatigue and sleep problems in circadian disorders can now benefit from treatments based on the programed use of synchronizers of the circadian clock, like chronotherapy, bright light and melatonin, combined with adequate sleep hygiene recommendations.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

These impairments of time perception are more important in the psychopathological field. Except during organic brain disease disturbances of time experience are observed especially during endogenous psychoses. Depressed men usually feel an unpleasant extension of subjective time experience. In schizophrenia there is a specific distorsion of time, characterized by troubles of the biographic orientation, by magic connexion-thinking with regard to time, or by a \"collapse\" of the chronological order. Somatic as well as psychological conditions seem to cause these disturbances.",

When standard societal timetables are superimposed upon this, major problems, such as insomnia, chronic sleep restriction, and excessive daytime sleepiness may arise. These enduring problems may often have profound impacts on performance, as well as mental and physical health. Numerous CRSWDs exist. Of these, a very small number are truly ‘intrinsic’ – that is due to inherited molecular dysfunction of the pacemaker. Ageing, behaviour, illness and the environment, may influence many of the disorders, and are likely to have a cumulative effect in any one individual. However, some disorders are more ‘extrinsic’ than others, such as shift work and jet lag disorder. The various types of CRSWDs are discussed within this chapter, as are the behavioural and pharmacological interventions that can be used in their management.",

Conversely, sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors are equally distributed among men and women. Further, while REM behavior disorder is more common in men, it is not rare in women and needs to be considered in cases of sleep-related injury. It is important to recognize the unique features of the various parasomnias and their relationships to neuropsychiatric disease. Finally, these conditions are reversible with the proper identification and treatment of underlying comorbid sleep disorders, the discontinuation of inducing agents, as well as the judicious use of pharmacotherapy and environmental modification.",

Directly age-related changes have to be distinguished from indirect modifications which are caused by simultaneous thyroidal or non-thyroidal illness or other physiological or pathophysiological states whose incidence increases with age. In summary, direct changes of the hypothalmo-pituitary-thyroid axis seem to be subtle and suggestive of a decreased hypothalamic stimulation of thyroid function. In parallel, disease-specific alterations such as the development of thyroid autonomy or changes in energy intake or sleep lead to pronounced alterations of thyroid function with age which may dominate the underlying ageing of the hypothalmo-pituitary thyroid axis itself. The following article attempts to delineate some aspects of the interplay of the regulation of thyroid function and the ageing process.",

Estimates of RISP prevalence vary dramatically, yielding estimates between 6% and 40%. Sleep paralysis is often considered as a sleep-onset problem under the assumption that episodes occur at the beginning of the sleep period during Sleep Onset REM Period (SOREMP). Multiphase sleep-wake schedule (MPS) regimes likely produce high level of cognitive arousal precipitating episodes by increasing potential for waking during immediate post-interruption REMPs.

L'organisation temporelle semble traduire, elle, une lutte entre tendance au sommeil lent et tendance au sommeil paradoxal. Le sommeil des mêmes sujets s'est pratiquement normalisé pendant et surtout après le decalage des horaires de sommeil, exceptée la persistance de la réduction importante de la latence du sommeil paradoxal. Il serait ainsi possible d'associer la dépression à une désynchronisation entre rythmicités contrôlant sommeil lent, sommeil paradoxal et d'autres rythmes circadiens. Une resynchronisation forcée par décalage des horaires de sommeil pourrait alors rendre compte des améliorations cliniques et biologiques qui ont été observées.",

Sleep disorders affect all aspects of health, showing a bi-directionality with health conditions and comorbidity with several diseases. Consequently, sleep disorders may have severe negative consequences both for the individual and the enterprise, as well as for society on the whole, in terms of health, productivity and social costs. When considering the disturbances of the sleep/wake cycle, it is important to distinguish between those connected with endogenous biological factors from those related to socio-environmental conditions, including work, and those associated with mental and physical diseases, that are often associated and interact with each other. Many sleep disorders are still underestimated and under-valued in clinical practice and, to a much greater extent, in workers' health surveillance. The present paper is aimed at drawing the attention of the occupational health physician to some key issues, particularly regarding excessive daytime sleepiness, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and shift and night work, as well as their implications in terms of health and occupational consequences. Information on the main aspects of clinical diagnosis and health surveillance, as well as risk management and prevention at the workplace, are provided.",

It mainly affects patients who are sight-impaired, is relatively rare in sighted patients, and is difficult to treat, with no guidelines. This case report discusses non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder in a sighted young man who complained of alternating severe insomnia and excessive sleepiness, with a sleep agenda and actigraphic data showing a daily delay of approximately 2 hours. A novel therapy by total sleep deprivation followed by a combination of morning light therapy and nocturnal melatonin administration was efficient in stopping his free-running sleep-wake pattern both immediately and in the long term. The treatment combination for 6 months resulted in stable circadian entrainment to a 24-hour cycle. Compliance with chronotherapy was maintained over the course of follow-up.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Individuals who complain of insomnia report repeated difficulty with either initially falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia) or remaining asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep. Their sleep is described as short and inadequate, light and easily disrupted, of poor quality, unrefreshing, unsatisfactory, or nonrestorative. Frequent extended periods of wakefulness or persistent early morning awakenings may be reported. In children, insomnia may present as bedtime resistance or lack of ability to sleep independently. This sleep disturbance is associated with impairment of daytime function. Most investigators define insomnia as a sleep latency of 30 minutes or more; wake time after sleep onset of 30 minutes or more; sleep efficiency of less than 85%; or total sleep time less than 6 to 6.5 hours, occurring at least 3 nights a week. Patients with insomnia often report greater subjective sleep disturbance compared to objective polysomnographic parameters. The discrepancy between subjective estimates and objective measures of sleep is believed to be due to persistent sensory processing during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which decreases the ability of patients with insomnia to distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Perception of sleep appears to be altered. Persons with insomnia may have a greater tendency to describe, when awakened from sleep, of being awake all along, compared with those without insomnia. In addition, they may overestimate the duration of their sleep latencies.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are characterized by an alteration of the phase relationship between the intrinsic circadian system and the extrinsic light-dark cycle that results in complaints of insomnia and excessive sleepiness.Under entrainment to the 24-hour day-night cycle, the sleep-wake pattern may assume various phase relationships to the circadian pacemaker by abnormally long or short intervals between the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) or the core body temperature (peak time) and wake-up time.Delayed and advanced sleep phase disorders may be associated with shifted circadian rhythms (body clock).Those with 'weak' circadian rhythms need a very bright stimulus of light to reset their body clock every day.Treatments include sleep hygiene education, timed exposure to bright light as well as avoidance of bright light at the wrong time of the day and pharmacologic approaches, such as melatonin.This article introduces the clinical approach to the diagnosis and management of the various circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including delayed and advanced sleep phase disorders, shift worker, and jet lag.",

      "abstract": "Many aspects of human physiology and behavior are dominated by 24-hour circadian rhythms that have a major impact on our health and well-being, including the sleep-wake cycle, alertness and performance patterns, and many daily hormone profiles. These rhythms are spontaneously generated by an internal \"pacemaker\" in the hypothalamus, and daily light exposure to the eyes is required to keep these circadian rhythms synchronized both internally and with the external environment. Sighted individuals take this daily synchronization process for granted, although they experience some of the consequences of circadian desynchrony when \"jetlagged\" or working night shifts. Most blind people with no perception of light, however, experience continual circadian desynchrony through a failure of light information to reach the hypothalamic circadian clock, resulting in cyclical episodes of poor sleep and daytime dysfunction. Daily melatonin administration, which provides a replacement synchronizing daily \"time cue, \" is a promising therapeutic strategy, although optimal treatment dose and timing remain to be determined.",

This article explores the interplay between adolescence, sleepiness, and traffic accidents. The author considers how adolescent sleepiness is associated with a putative sleep phase delay (due to biological and psychosocial factors) and to inadequate sleep habits. Early school starting times significantly increases the sleep reduction. Likewise, weekend delays of sleep schedules alters the stability of normal sleep-wake patterns. The consequent sleep deprivation interferes with daytime functioning by provoking daytime sleepiness. This, in turn, may lead to cognitive deficits with difficulties concentrating and paying attention, to mood and behavior problems, to development of major disorders of the sleep-wake cycle, and to vulnerability to traffic accidents. During the nighttime period of increased sleepiness, young people (ages 18 to 24 years) are more vulnerable to traffic accidents. Indeed, accidents due to somnolence (sleepiness) present a peak occurrence at age 20 years.",

      "title": "Beyond the motor impairment in dyskinetic cerebral palsy: neuropsychological and connectome-based approach",
      "abstract": "La paralisis cerebral (PC) se define como un grupo de trastornos del movimiento y/o la postura y de la funcion motora debidos a una lesion, interferencia o anomalia no progresiva en un cerebro inmaduro o en desarrollo. Estos trastornos motores a menudo se acompanan de alteraciones sensoriales, de la percepcion, de la cognicion, de la comunicacion, del comportamiento o de epilepsia, y se ha evidenciado que estos deficits pueden tener un mayor impacto sobre la calidad de vida que el propio deficit motor. Teniendo en cuenta la clasificacion de la PC segun el tipo de afectacion motora se identifica que la PC discinetica es un subtipo poco frecuente (entre el 3% y el 15% de todos los casos) que se caracteriza por patrones anormales de postura y/o movimiento, acompanados de movimientos involuntarios, descontrolados, recurrentes y, ocasionalmente, estereotipados. Este tipo de PC se ha asociado principalmente a procesos de hipoxia-isquemia en bebes nacidos a termino o casi a termino, y a la presencia de ictericia grave. Se ha evidenciado como la PC discinetica es mas incapacitante que otros tipos de PC, no solo por su asociacion con una mayor afectacion motriz sino tambien por una mayor presencia y gravedad de deficits asociados, como una mayor afectacion del habla y de la comunicacion.\nCabe destacar que los estudios que han analizado este tipo de PC son todavia escasos, probablemente debido a su menor frecuencia y mayor gravedad. Especialmente escasos son los estudios cognitivos y de neuroimagen, ya que las pruebas neuropsicologicas requieren de una destreza manual y/o de respuestas verbales y los estudios de neuroimagen implican la adquisicion de secuencias de resonancia magnetica en donde la persona debe permanecer quieta. \nLos estudios cognitivos realizados hasta el momento se focalizan principalmente en el rendimiento intelectual general, y evidencian que entre el 52% y el 65% de los casos presenta discapacidad intelectual. No obstante, cabe destacar que no existe un consenso sobre como evaluar el rendimiento intelectual en esta poblacion, con una gran variabilidad entre estudios. La aplicacion de tests psicometricos que requieren habilidades manipulativas y/o respuestas verbales pueden estar emmascarando e infravalorando el rendimiento intelectual real de estas personas. Los estudios que se focalizan en el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas son escasos y se basan en muestras muy reducidas que a menudo no superan los 8 casos. Por otro lado, los estudios cualitativos de neuroimagen han hallado una afectacion de ganglios basales y talamo. Las primeras evidencias de estudios de resonancia magnetica de difusion apuntan a una afectacion mas extensa, con una mayor afectacion de la sustancia blanca. \nEs por ello que esta tesis tiene como objetivos principales: 1) identificar una medida objetiva de inteligencia adecuada para la gran heterogeneidad que existe en la PC, 2) describir el perfil cognitivo de una muestra relativamente amplia de personas con PC discinetica, y 3) analizar el estado de la sustancia blanca cerebral de esta poblacion mediante la tecnica del conectoma. Para ello se incluyeron en el estudio un total de 52 sujetos con PC discinetica y 52 sujetos control, a quienes se les administro una bateria neuropsicologia que evaluaba el rendimiento cognitivo general (mediante las Matrices progresivas de Raven - version color, el Test de vocabulario en imagenes de Peabody - III y la Escala no verbal de aptitud intelectual de Wechsler) y cinco dominios cognitivos especificos (atencion, visuopercepcion, lenguaje, aprendizaje y memoria y funcion ejecutiva) y se les realizo un estudio de resonancia magnetica estructural. \nLos resultados comparando las diferentes pruebas de inteligencia muestran un mayor potencial de las Matrices progresivas de Raven. Esta prueba demuestra una gran aplicabilidad en la PC, incluso en casos con una grave afectacion motora y pocas habilidades comunicativas. Tambien se evidencia que proporciona informacion completa sobre el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas, tanto visuales como verbales, y que es sensible al estado de la estructura cerebral en fibras de asociacion y de proyeccion y estructuras subcorticales como los ganglios basales y el talamo.\nEn relacion al perfil cognitivo de la PC discinetica, los resultados a nivel grupal han evidenciado un rendimiento cognitivo por debajo del grupo control en todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal. No obstante, estas alteraciones cognitivas se han relacionado con la alteracion motriz, hallandose una afectacion cognitiva mas generalizada a medida que incrementa la gravedad motora. En los casos mas leves, aquellos en los que existe deambulacion autonoma, se ha evidenciado un rendimiento similar al del grupo control en casi todas las funciones evaluadas a excepcion de las funciones visuoperceptivas, atencionales y de la memoria visual. Los casos moderados, en los que se requiere de ayuda para la deambulacion, han mostrado las mismas alteraciones cognitivas y se anaden dificultades en las areas de lenguaje receptivo. En el grupo mas grave, aquellos casos en que no es posible la deambulacion, se observa el mismo rendimiento que con el grupo general (un rendimiento inferior en todas las funciones cognitivas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal).\n En el estudio de neuroimagen realizado en una submuestra de 25 participantes con PC y 24 sujetos control, se ha demostrado una disrupcion de la conectividad cerebral a diferentes niveles (global, regional y a nivel de conexion). Este patron se caracteriza por una disrupcion generalizada de la sustancia blanca cerebral, pero una afectacion mas localizada de la integridad de esta, que incluye areas mas posteriores (parietal, occipital y temporal) y una relativa preservacion de las areas prefrontales. Tambien se evidencia alteracion en la conectividad hipocampal, asi como de estructuras subcorticales (principalmente en putamen y talamo). Por ultimo, se ha hallado una correlacion entre el estado de la sustancia blanca de la circuiteria sensoriomotora y el nivel de gravedad motriz (tanto gruesa como fina) y se ha evidenciado como la red formada por conexiones fronto-estriatales y fronto-parietales juega un papel relevante en el rendimiento cognitivo general de estos sujetos. \nEn el presente trabajo se discuten estos resultados en relacion a la literatura previa tanto en el ambito de la PC como en otras patologias, asi como teniendo en cuenta el desarrollo normativo.",

      "title": "Exploration of sleep disorders in the elderly: which particularities?",
      "abstract": "There are many reasons to take into consideration the sleep disorders in the elderly. The sleep quality degrades with age and is strongly affected by medical conditions, intrinsic sleep disorders, or by a combination of these factors. Other age-related conditions such as severe dementia, dependence or living in institution worsen sleep disturbances in older people. When living alone elderly people, being cognitively impaired and medically disabled, may not be able to complain about sleep problems. Sleep disorders are thus underdiagnosed, unmarked, and insufficiently investigated in the elderly. In this heterogeneous population, sleep assessment should include a global geriatric approach and be individually adapted for each subject. The sleep interview must specially include medical comorbidities, medication uses, and aged-related changes of lifestyle such as retirement, loss of spouse, hospitalization or institutionalization. In the elderly with loss of autonomy, standard sleep assessment is not always adequate and must be replaced by shorter, simpler or observation-based tests such as the Sleep disorders inventory, Observation-based nocturnal sleep inventory, Observation and interview based diurnal sleepiness inventory. When sleep log is impossible, actimetry is an excellent alternative for studying sleep-wake rhythm. Ventilatory polygraphy is a simpler test for detecting sleep apnea than polysomnography. Utilization of sophisticated investigations should be discussed when the feasibility and usefulness is limited.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness characterized by alternating periods of elevated and depressed mood. Sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder are present during all stages of the condition and exert a negative impact on overall course, quality of life, and treatment outcomes. We examine the partnership between circadian system (process C) functioning and sleep–wake homeostasis (process S) on optimal sleep functioning and explore the role of disruptions in both systems on sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder. A convergence of evidence suggests that sleep problems in bipolar disorder result from dysregulation across both process C and process S systems. Biomarkers of depressive episodes include heightened fragmentation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, reduced REM latency, increased REM density, and a greater percentage of awakenings, while biomarkers of manic episodes include reduced REM latency, greater percentage of stage I sleep, increased REM density, discontinuous sleep patterns, shortened total sleep time, and a greater time awake in bed. These findings highlight the importance of targeting novel treatments for sleep disturbance in bipolar disorder. Keywords: bipolar disorder, circadian rhythms, sleep–wake homeostasis",

      "title": "OP.02 Restless legs, periodic limb movements and breathing problems",
      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be “things that go bump in the night”, or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

      "abstract": "Most of the physiological functions of the body, including hormone secretion, differ during sleep and wakefulness. Circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep pressure are the determining factors in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Fluctuations in hormone levels are largely determined by circadian rhythms. The central biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is synchronized with external signals, and largely determines the daily rhythms of hormone secretion. Many hormones can affect respiratory function during sleep, exacerbating sleep apnea when their secretion is excessive or deficient. Sleep disorders can occur in a number of neuroendocrine diseases, worsening the quality of life of patients and, in some cases, contributing to the development of life-threatening complications. Screening for sleep disorders, in particular the active detection of sleep apnea in acromegaly, hypothyroidism and hypercorticism, can significantly reduce the risk of complications with timely treatment.",

Parasomnias encompass abnormal movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning that can emerge in relation to any sleep stage at any time of the night. Parasomnias can affect people of any age-infants, newborns, and even fetuses (as described in the documentary Sleep Runners: The Stories Behind Everyday Parasomnias []). It is believed that the kicking of a fetus in utero is a manifestation of \"spontaneous motility patterns,\" that is, the most primitive form of motor activation-without concurrent inhibition-during primordial sleep (). This developmentally normal motor activity, when exaggerated in intensity and duration, could alter or disrupt the sleep of the \"bed partner\" (the mother), causing an insomnia in the mother induced by parasomnia behavior in her fetus ().",

      "abstract": "Sleeping and waking behaviours affect the development of preterm infants in multiple ways. First, sleeping and waking affect the infant’s ability to respond to stimulation. Second, infants with neurological problems exhibit abnormal sleep patterns. Sleep and wakefulness may also have direct effects on brain development and learning that continue after the infant has been discharged home. Finally, differences in the sleep-wake patterns of preterm infants as compared to those of full-term infants might lead to sleep problems after hospital discharge.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to examine if a disturbance of slow-wave sleep may partly account for the imbalance between waking and sleep observed in insomnia. 40 normal subjects and 40 insomniacs were recorded in the laboratory. No direct interregulation appeared between total sleep and REM sleep on one hand, and between slow-wave sleep and REM sleep on the other. Slow-wave sleep, however, was linked to the waking-sleep imbalance, as low values of stages 3 and 4 were statistically associated with low total sleep duration. The reduction of slow-wave sleep could not merely be attributed to an increased pressure of wakefulness. Our results indicate that it represents probably a disturbance in itself, perhaps related in some cases to a precocious senescence of sleep, but do not account alone for all sleep disturbances.",

The REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with parkinsonian syndromes and other neurodegenerative disorders. Restless legs syndrome occurs with myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nThe syndrome of sleep apnea interacts with neurologic disorders in several ways. 1) Many patients with neurologic disorders have coexisting sleep apnea simply because obstructive sleep apnea is so common.

      "title": "Gangguan Insomnia pada Mahasiswa Yang Menyusun Skripsi (Studi Kasus pada Mahasiswa Jurusan Psikologi Universitas Negeri Semarang",
      "abstract": "Tidur merupakan bagian hidup manusia yang memiliki porsi banyak,\r\nrata-rata hampir seperempat hingga sepertiga waktu digunakan untuk tidur. Tidur\r\nmerupakan kebutuhan bukan suatu keadaan istirahat yang tidak bermanfaat.\r\nNamun ada kalanya seseorang mengalami kesulitan tidur yang menyebabkan\r\nberkurangnya waktu tubuh untuk beristirahat, maupun untuk menjaga\r\nkeseimbangan metabolisme dan biokimiawi tubuh.\r\nBanyak sekali faktor yang menyebabkan seseorang mengalami insomnia,\r\nantara lain adalah faktor biologis dan psikologis. Kesulitan-kesulitan saat\r\npenyusunan skripsi sering dirasakan sebagai beban berat, akibatnya kesulitan yang\r\ndirasakan tersebut berkembang menjadi perasaan negatif yang menimbulkan\r\nketegangan, kekhawatiran, stress dan dapat menyebabkan insomnia.\r\nPenelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat gambaran insomnia yang dialami\r\nmahasiswa selama menyusun skripsi, penyebab insomnia yang dialami subjek,\r\ngejala yang dialami subjek, serta strategi yang dilakukan untuk mengatasi\r\ninsomnia tersebut. Insomnia merupakan suatu kondisi ketidakpuasan seseorang\r\ndalam hal kuantitas atau kualitas tidurnya dan berlangsung selama beberapa waktu\r\n(Lumbantombing, 2004). Insomnia dapat disebabkan karena masalah psikis pada\r\nseseorang, rasa cemas dan perasaan takut yang berlebihan, bekerja terlampau\r\nlama dan keras, rasa sakit dan perasaan tidak menyenangkan.\r\nSubjek dalam penelitian ini adalah mahasiswa yang tengah menyusun\r\nskripsi yang mengalami insomnia selama lebih dari 1 bulan. Subjek berjumlah dua\r\norang subjek primer, dan dua orang subjek sekunder untuk masing-masing subjek\r\nprimer. Peneliti mengambil sampel penelitian dari mahasiswa psikologi\r\nUniversitas Negeri Semarang. Dalam penelitian ini peneliti menggunakan teknik\r\nobservasi non partisipan, yaitu peneliti secara pasif tidak terlibat langsung dalam\r\naktifitas yang sedang berlangsung dan terjadi sambil mencatat tingkah laku di\r\nsekitarnya. Peneliti juga menggunakan teknik wawancara yang bersifat\r\nsemiterstruktur yaitu wawancara dilakukan secara terbuka tetapi tetap\r\nberpedoman pada pertanyaan-pertanyaan tertulis.\r\nBerdasarkan keseluruhan hasil dan pembahasan dalam penelitian yang\r\ndiperoleh dalam penelitian studi kasus ini maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa, jenis\r\ninsomnia yang dialami subjek termasuk insomnia kronis (cronic insomnia). Bila\r\nsubjek sudah sama sekali tidak bisa tidur (dalam dua puluh empat jam subjek\r\ntidak tidur), subjek langsung meminum obat tidur yang diperjualbelikan secara\r\nbebas. Gejala-gejala insomnia yang dialami subjek antara lain subjek mengalami\r\nkesulitan untuk memulai tidur. AR harus membuat dirinya merasa lelah terlebih\r\ndulu agar dapat tidur, jika tetap tidak dapat tidur maka AR akan memaksakan\r\nmemejamkan mata agar dapat tidur, sedangkan NM harus menutup matanya\r\ndengan kain agar dapat tertidur. Gejala lain adalah kedua subjek merasa lesu dan\r\npusing saat bangun tidur dan susah berkonsentrasi saat melakukan pekerjaan.\r\nFaktor penyebab yang dialami subjek sehingga dapat menyebabkan\r\ninsomnia yaitu yang pertama karena permasalahan yang timbul saat penyusunan\r\nskripsi, yang kedua yaitu karena tuntutan orangtua yang menginginkan agar\r\nsubjek dapat menyelesaikan kuliahnya dengan cepat, dan mendapatkan gelar\r\nsarjana. Adapun faktor yang ketiga yaitu karena waktu perkuliahan yang sudah\r\nmendekati batas. Simpulan keempat, Gangguan insomnia memberikan dampak\r\nnegatif dalam kehidupan subjek. Pertama, akan mengurangi daya tahan tubuh\r\nsehingga berpeluang terhadap munculnya penyakit. Kedua, susah tidur akan\r\nberpengaruh terhadap stabilitas emosi sehingga mempengaruhi aktivitas\r\nkehidupan sehari-hari. Subjek mangalami penurunan tingkat motivasi,\r\nkonsentrasi, ketelitian, kreativitas, dan produktivitas kerja. Dari penelitian yang\r\ntelah dilakukan maka peneliti dapat memberikan saran pada subjek untuk\r\nmengurangi dan menghilangkan segala kekhawatiran dan kecemasan dengan\r\nbersikap optimis dan merilekskan diri saat melakukan pekerjaan, terutama saat\r\nakan tidur.\r\nSaran kedua adalah olahraga pada sore hari (enam jam sebelum tidur).\r\nMelakukan peregangan otot atau jalan kaki secukupnya selama duapuluh menit.\r\nHal ini akan meningkatkan metabolisme dan suhu badan, lalu akan menurun\r\nsekitar enam jam kemudian yang berefek pada tidur yang nyenyak. Ketiga,\r\nMengurangi rokok dan tidak merokok beberapa jam sebelum tidur karena rokok\r\nmengandung nikotin yang dapat meningkatkan semangat karena berefek sebagai\r\nneurostimulan. Selain itu rokok dapat membahayakan kesehatan diri sendiri dan\r\norang lain di sekitarnya, karena orang lain yang tidak merokok tetapi terkena asap\r\nrokok juga akan mengalami gangguan kesehatan dengan resiko yang sama.",

      "abstract": "Muscle Tension Dysphonia-The Untold StoryHuman voice production involves coordinated functioning of the vocal folds and regulated airflow from the lungs to the oropharynx.A synchronized activity of respiratory, phonatory, resonatory and articulatory systems lead to the optimal phonatory outcome.Smaller intrinsic muscles and larger extrinsic muscles need to work in harmony, to produce voice, which is appropriate to age, sex, and society.The excessive tension of the laryngeal or extralaryngeal muscles or both result in suboptimal phonatory function.Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is a condition characterized by varying degree of dysphonia and other associated symptoms, primarily due to tension and uncoordinated activity of intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the larynx.This is generally subdivided into primary and secondary type.In primary MTD, there is no structural or neurological abnormality associated with muscle tension.The secondary type usually occurs as a compensatory mechanism for underlying glottic insufficiency or mucosal lesion.On the other hand, long-term untreated MTD may itself turn out to be a precursor of phonotraumatic mucosal lesion.Earlier, these patients with vocal dysfunction with no apparent structural lesion or neurological dysfunction were stamped under the category of functional voice disorders.Subsequently, extensive work by many authors has led to the understanding of this complex condition.Evolution of classification has also resulted in the addition of a plethora of terminologies to the literature namely hyperfunctional dysphonia, muscle misuse voice disorder, musculoskeletal tension dysphonia, hyperkinetic dysphonia, laryngeal isometric disorder, laryngeal tension fatigue syndrome and many more.Finally, \"muscle tension dysphonia\" has emerged to be the universally accepted nomenclature.Multifactorial etiology of this condition is well established.Anxiety and stress, coupled with vocal abuse and misuse are the major causative factors; personality plays an important role.Besides, compensatory maladaptation for any structural lesion can lead to secondary MTD.An MTD, either primary or secondary is one of the most commonly encountered diagnoses in any voice clinic.Patients may present with a mild degree of hoarseness to extremely strained voice, along with odynophonia.A careful history of vocal demand and usage along with any history of underlying stress often provides diagnostic clue.External neck inspection is of paramount importance to detect the position of larynx and muscle tension during phonation.Palpation of suprahyoid, thyrohyoid and cricothyroid space usually elicits tenderness of specific muscles, even at rest.The endolaryngeal examination should ideally be done with a flexible nasolaryngoscope, to detect supraglottic muscle tension during the larynx in action.Stroboscopy helps identify any associated mucosal lesion leading to MTD.Intrinsic muscle tension at the supraglottic or glottic level is usually graded on the basis of various classifications.Management involves voice therapy which may be indirect or direct.Indirect therapy involves educating patients about healthy phonatory habits and training corrective vocal exercises to release tension.Direct therapy is aimed at releasing musculoskeletal tension to promote healthy phonatory posture.Circumlaryngeal therapy, stretch and flow phonation, vocal function exercises and resonant voice therapy are the common techniques used.Medical treatment of associated problems like laryngopharyngeal reflux and surgical treatment of any structural lesion should be undertaken.Role of EMG-guided botulinum toxin injection is also emerging in recent years.Diagnosis of MTD is simple and straightforward, provided the clinician is aware of this condition.However, there is a need for more comprehensive grading system encompassing both external and endolaryngeal findings.This would help in delivering more tailor-made direct voice therapy to correct tension of specific muscles.Use of botulinum toxin injection is also likely to increase, especially for cases refractory to voice therapy.",

      "abstract": "The current COVID-19 pandemic caused enormous suffering to people in the disease state and caused significant mortality; the morbidity of people after COVID-19 is also alarming. It is named post-COVID conditions by WHO and CDC USA. Its estimated prevalence ranges from 10% to 50%, and circadian rhythm sleep disturbance is one of the essential symptoms of the post-COVID state. The circadian sleep disturbance may appear isolated or comorbid, associated with other symptoms like chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety. The relationship of the circadian rhythm disturbance with the comorbid condition may be bidirectional. The circadian rhythm modulates gene expression, body metabolism, immune status, and endocrine function of the body, as well as a person's behavior. So, the consequences of sleep rhythm disturbance may be enormous. The pathophysiology of sleep-rhythm disturbance in the post-COVID state is mainly unknown and is still under research. Persistence of the organism or prolonged and dysregulated inflammation also explains sleep, circadian rhythm, and other neuropsychiatric disorders in the post-COVID period. The countermeasures against this disorder are still under research. Sleep extension, appropriate bedtime recommendations, maintaining sleep hygiene and reciprocity between physical activity and the circadian system, time-of-day-restricted feeding (TRF), chronobiology, and drugs, like melatonin, may be an approach to treat such conditions. The concept of chronology is the newer one; it identifies the body's circadian rhythm of various biologic responses and modifies the treatment to gain optimum benefit.",

      "abstract": "Sleep in dementias has been mainly studied in Alzheimer disease (AD). Sleep disturbances are found in 25 to 35% of subjects with AD. Subjective and objective disturbances are described. Long nocturnal awakenings disrupt sleep; total sleep time and sleep efficiency are reduced. Slow wave sleep is decreased and sometimes disappears. REM sleep percentage is also reduced and at a later stage of the disease, REM latency is increased. Sleep fragmentation can be associated with excessive daytime napping and sleepiness, and with other behavioral symptoms such as the sundowning syndrome and nocturnal agitation. Sleep abnormalities closely parallel the level of severity of dementia. The rest/activity ratio and the sleep-wake rhythms are more and more disturbed; the phase delay of the temperature rhythm is associated with the severity of the sundowning syndrome. Sleep disturbances and behavioral symptoms are the main reasons to institutionalize the patient. Sleep disturbances are related to multiple factors. Pathophysiological changes resulting of the disease itself, such as damage to the cholinergic pathways and to the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, contribute to sleep changes in AD. Associated medical and psychiatric illness and their different treatments as well as environmental factors also induced sleep disturbances. Sleep-disordered breathing is a highly prevalent condition in AD patients and restless leg syndrome may account for nocturnal agitation. In Parkinson and in Lewy body dementias, sleep disturbances are more severe than in DA and REM sleep behavior disorder can precede by several years these diseases. Sleep attacks and sleepiness are very frequent in Parkinson disease. Specific etiologies should drive specific treatment. Several non pharmacologic treatments are usually associated to treat sleep disturbances in AD: information, increased daytime physical, social activities to minimize daytime naps and exposure to bright light. Some studies found advantages to associate melatonin in the evening.",

Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

Sleep disorders can adversely impact physical and mental health. Nonrestorative sleep can hamper a child's ability to concentrate and control emotions and behavior. Sleep disorders vary among age groups, but most can occur with varying frequency at any age. Several disorders are typically seen only during the first few years of life, including colic, excessive nighttime feedings, and sleep onset association disorder. A number of conditions are common during childhood but begin to improve as the child ages. The non-REM sleep parasomnias, including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors, are the most common in the pediatric category. Nightmares are also common in childhood but can occur at any age. Sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respirations are not found only in adults but are, in fact, quite common in the pediatric population. While these disorders can occur at any age, treatment options vary substantially by age.",

      "abstract": "A striking difference between vestibular tone imbalance in the roll and pitch planes is that roll dysfunction is caused by unilateral and pitch dysfunction by bilateral lesions of paired pathways in the brainstem or of the cerebellar flocculus (Brandt and Dieterich 1995). This structural difference probably explains why a vestibular tone imbalance in pitch frequently occurs with various intoxications or metabolic disorders. This is unusual for tone imbalance in yaw or roll, unless as a functional decompensation of an earlier (compensated) tone imbalance. Downbeat and upbeat nystagmus are not merely ocular motor disorders, but central vestibular disorders that also affect orientation and balance. A tone imbalance in the pitch plane manifests as vertical upbeating or downbeating nystagmus, fore-aft head-and-body tilt, and deviation of the subjective horizontal toward the direction of the slow phase of the nystagmus.",

      "title": "Alterations of the circadian timing system in rodent and non human primate models of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Since the first description by James Parkinson in his essay on the shaking palsy, Parkinson’s disease (PD) was recognized as a motor disease identified by a tetrad of symptoms, namely; akinesia, muscular rigidity, resting tremor and postural instability. These symptoms are known to be related to loss of dopamine (DA) in the striatum following neural degeneration in the substantia nigra (SN). It is increasingly recognized that non-motor and perhaps non-dopaminergic related symptoms inevitably emerge and worsen during disease progression. Sleep disruption is one of the major non-motor symptoms and has been suggested as a preclinical marker of the disease. Models of sleep regulation have emphasized two distinct processes: a sleep-control mechanism, or sleep homeostat, and a circadian oscillator. The circadian oscillator, based in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is responsible for the tendency to sleep during certain phases of the 24-hour cycle and the consolidation of sleep and wake into distinct episodes. The sleep homeostat is responsible for monitoring and reacting to the need for sleep, causing the urge to sleep to depend on prior amounts of sleep or wakefulness. While disruptions in the circuitry and the homeostatic processes involved in the regulation of sleep-wake behaviour is will documented in PD, the potential involvement of alterations of the circadian system have not been studied in detail. The aim of my thesis is to investigate alterations in the circadian timing system using two animal models of PD: the mouse and the non-human primate. Taken together, the studies show that disturbances of circadian functions occur after MPTP treatment in the non-human primate but not in the mouse model of PD. These results emphasize the limitations of the MPTP-treated mouse model of PD for the study of non-motor symptoms, and reinforce previous studies that question the adequacy of this model to replicate cardinal motor features of the disease. In contrast, results in the non-human primate model stress the importance of dopaminergic degeneration in the circadian organisation of behavioral sleep wake cycle in PD",

      "abstract": "Sleep comprises one third of human life and is very important for maintaining healthy mental and physical states. Sleep disorders disturbing normal sleep are very common and may induce serious consequences. Sleep disorder medicine is based on the concept of two different states (waking and sleep) of the human brain. The problems of the waking conscious state affect sleep and problems during sleep also affect daytime mental and physical activities. The common symp-toms of patients with sleep disorders are excessive daytime sleepiness, a decrease in alertness, and fatigue. To detect sleep disorders, we should understand the physiology of normal sleep. Normal sleep consists of non-rapid eye movement (75% to 80%) and rapid eye movement (20% to 25%) sleep. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders second edition lists 77 different sleep disorders divided into 8 categories. Clinical approaches to sleep disorder patients should include detailed history taking including sleep history, a sleep questionnaire, sleep diary, physical examination including the nasal/oral cavities and airway, and neurological/psychological examination. The common sleep disorders are obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and circadian rhythm sleep disorder. We should learn the characteristic clinical features of each sleep disorder and how to detect and treat them. We need a more active effort to educate physicians about sleep disorder medicine and should try large sample, long-term, and prospective studiesto reveal the pathophysiology and enhance the treatment of sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are common, serious, and treatable. However, most patients with sleep disorders are underdiagnosed and not treated appropriately due to lack of knowledge of sleep disorder medicine. The Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea should focus more attention on and provide more support for timely diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.",

Modern sleep research has opened important views into the structure of sleep and the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. In a narrower sense sleep disorders mean a deficiency of sleep (hyposomnia). This may concern the induction of sleep or its maintenance. Sleep disorders without underlying disease may be differentiated from those caused by different diseases. Hypersomnia may occur as a symptom of various cerebral dysfunctions and processes, as an episodic disorder (Kleine-Levin-syndrome) or as a part of the Pickwick-syndrome. In narcolepsy characteristic symptoms are sleep attacks, kataplexy (emotionally induced loss of muscle tone) and transient pareses during awakening. Disturbances linked with sleep are snoring, somnambulism, speaking and grinding of the teeth during sleep and nocturnal enuresis. They may constitute idiopathic disorders. On the other hand, there may be similarities between epileptic phenomena and these disorders. Some epilepsies demonstrate relations to the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness which become evident in the manifestation of seizures and epileptiform EEG activity at certain stages of vigilance.",

Insomnia has been defined as both a symptom and a disorder, and is characterized as sleep that is chronically unrestorative or poor in quality often due to difficulty in initiating sleep, in maintaining sleep, or with waking up too early. Insomnia results in some form of daytime impairment in the patient's normal activites. Although the exact pathophysiology of insomnia is poorly understood, it is often believed to arise from a state of hyperarousal in multiple neurophysiological and/or psychological systems. Population-based studies suggest that while about one-third of the general population complains of sleep disturbance, only 10-15 percent has associated symptoms of daytime functional impairment, and even fewer, only 6-10 percent have impairments sufficient for the diagnostic criteria of insomnia. The cornerstone of the insomnia evaluation and diagnosis is a comprehensive history obtained by the clinical interview with patient and/or family. Additional assessment tools, such as sleep diary or log, various questionnaires, actigraphy, and multichannel polysomnography (PSG) have been used as an aid to diagnosis, although many are limited in their validation. Insomnia causes a significant burden of medical, psychiatric, societal consequences on the individual and societal level. Clinicians in either primary settings or specialized clinics should have knowledge to manage insomnia with confidence.",

A la suite des observations fortuites de Schulte, des séries systématiques et contrôlées ont défini le cadre et les limites de l’efficacité de la PTS et diverses investigations biologiques ont cherché à identifier des variables prédictives de son activité. La PTS apporte une amélioration dans environ 60% des cas, plus régulièrement dans les formes endogènes et lorsqu’il y a des variations diurnes de l’humeur. Cette amélioration est globale et elle apparaît le plus souvent aux heures de l’aube mais elle est transitoire, le bénéfice étant perdu au lendemain de la nuit de récupération d’où la nécessité de répéter la privation ou d’y associer une chimiothérapie antidépressive. Les investigations neurobiologiques situent la réponse clinique en rapport avec diverses modifications sur les paramétres catécholaminergiques et neuro-endocriniens ainsi que sur la structuration du sommeil. L’activation thymique se corrèle avec une facilité relative à maintenir l’éveil et se manifeste à un horaire particulier qui correspond à une époque circadienne critique. La PTS produirait une réorganisation des rapports entre la veille et le sommeil et parviendrait à rétablir les coïncidences de phases des rythmes biologiques. Ces données apportent une contribution nouvelle à la notion spécifique d’instabilité dépressive.",

The condition is multi-factorial, dependent on lifestyle, mood and personality, as well as on familial factors but no single factor in isolation is sufficient to explain the delay in sleep timing. Refusal to attend school may be important in some instances but will not explain cases with delayed age of onset. In half the subjects the delay in sleep phase started in childhood or adolescence. The syndrome causes severe disruption to education, work and family life. Polysomnography, motor activity monitoring of rest-activity cycles, plasma melatonin profiles and urinary melatonin metabolite excretion are normal. Different patterns of sleep phase delay seen in the syndrome include stable, progressive, irregular and non-24 hour sleep-wake cycles. These patterns may result from different social and other Zeitgebers (\"time-markers\", for example sunrise, sunset) in the normal environment. Treatment by forced sleep-wake phase advance or with melatonin resulted in a partial sleep-phase advance but this was not maintained on stopping treatment.",

Sleep disorder can cause many complications, including the worsening of the brain injury prognosis. Insomnia occurs in 29% traumatic brain injury patient. Insomnia suspected due injury in inferior frontal, anterior temporal including basal forebrain, also sympathetic nerve hyperactivity. Insomnia increase the risk of stroke, disability and mood disturbance. Hypersomnia occurs in 28% traumatic brain injury patients. Hypersomnia suspected due orexin decrease and injury in sleep promoting area. Hypersomnia suspected related to recovery, less activity time and accident due sleepiness. There are no prevalence data of circadian rhythm disturbance after traumatic brain injury. This disturbance is caused by injury in supra-chiasmatic nucleus and related to global worsening on the patient. Insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbance are highly linked with injury area, but hypersomnia is not particularly linked to any area and only related to orexin decrease. Insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbance are highly related to the worsening condition on the patient, but hypersomnia is associated with recovery and not particularly related to any disturbances. It is hoped that understanding the sleep disorder after traumatic brain injury can rise the alertness of this matter and encourage clinicians to increase the quality of sleep disorder due to traumatic brain injury management. Cedera kepala merupakan salah satu cedera yang umum terjadi. Cedera ini sering diikuti dengan gangguan tidur seperti insomnia, hipersomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian. Gangguan ini sering dapat menyebabkan berbagai komplikasi termasuk memperparah penyembuhan cedera kepala. Insomnia setelah cedera kepala terjadi sebanyak 29%. Insomnia diduga disebabkan oleh cedera pada daerah inferior frontal, anterior temporal termasuk basal otak depan, juga peningkatan kerja saraf simpatis. Insomnia meningkatkan resiko stroke, disabilitas dan gangguan suasana hati. Hipersomnia setelah cedera kepala terjadi sebanyak 28%. Hipersomnia diduga akibat penurunan orexin dan akibat kerusakan pada area yang mempertahankan bangun. Hipersomnia diduga berhubungan dengan penyembuhan, waktu tersita akibat tidur dan kecelakaan akibat mengantuk. Belum ada data prevalensi gangguan ritme sirkadian setelah cedera kepala. Gangguan ini disebabkan oleh cedera pada nukleus suprakiasmatik dan sering dikaitkan dengan perburukan kondisi pasien. Insomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian sering dihubungkan dengan lokasi tertentu dari cedera, namun hipersomnia berhubungan dengan kadar orexin dan tidak terlalu dikaitkan terhadap area tertentu. Insomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian berhubungan dengan perburukan, namun hipersomnia bisa menandakan perbaikan dan tidak berhubungan signifikan dengan gangguan lainnya. Diharapkan dengan memahami gangguan tidur ini dapat meningkatkan kewaspadaan bagi para klinisi dan mendorong untuk penelitian berikutnya sehingga penanganan pasien gangguan tidur akibat cedera kepala dapat menjadi lebih baik.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is one of the most common clinical syndromes of somnological disorders, including any sleep disorders under sufficient time and appropriate sleeping conditions. Significant sleep disturbances are common in children who enter the intensive care unit. Between 18 and 65 per cent of children aged between 2 and 18 hospitalized in the intensive care unit have a clinical condition of acute confusion, better known as delirium. Sleep fragmentation, reduction of total sleep time, lack of slow, deep sleep and rapid sleep, and shift of sleep time are changes that can also act as insomnia triggers. Their presence worsens the course of the disease in the patient, prolongs the hospital stay, and increases the risk of complications and lethality. Circadian sleep disorder is a condition that requires close monitoring. Although insomnia therapy approaches are not yet reliable, early diagnosis of insomnia can reduce the duration of the delirium. Sleep assessment includes questionnaires and diaries. However, it was recognized that, despite the difficulties in implementing and interpreting polysomnography, it was still a gold standard for more accurate detection of changes in sleep phases and the difference between normal and abnormal sleep. In the absence of a polysomnograph, it is permissible to use a prolonged video assisted EEG. The inventive multimodal video-assisted monitoring method makes it possible to diagnose sleep disorders, pain syndrome and differential diagnosis of apnoea with cardiac and conductivity disorders or abnormal brain activity, including the presence of sub-clinical convulsions in patients of high-risk groups using a safe and non-invasive method for analyzing trends in the total bioelectric activity of different biological structures of a child. The validation of questionnaires according to the age of the child is also an important step in the timely diagnosis of sleep disorders in older children.",

      "title": "Developing an International Core Outcome Set for SSD Interventions",
      "abstract": "Unilateral hearing loss or single-sided deafness (SSD) is defined as normal or near-normal hearing in one ear and a severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing impairment in the other ear.1 Common causes of SSD in adulthood include vestibular schwannoma and associated surgery, Ménière's disease, and bacterial or viral infections. SSD affects an estimated 12 to 27 individuals in every 100,000 of the general population.2Shutterstock/Inspiring, hearing loss, deafness, technology.Figure 1: Steps to develop a core outcome set for SSD interventions for adults. Hearing loss, deafness, technology.Difficulties in daily life as a result of SSD vary considerably from person to person. Functional difficulties in everyday life are commonly reported, such as difficulties in speech perception in noisy environments and poor spatial awareness. SSD can also negatively affect one's psychological well-being, resulting in worries about losing one's hearing in the other ear and/or reduced confidence and belief in one's abilities to participate in social situations. Various social impacts of SSD can result from activity limitations and participation restrictions, including withdrawal from and within situations.3 The multidimensional burden of SSD on an individual's overall health is indicated by reductions in health-related quality of life.4 Interventions like a contralateral routing of signals (CROS) aid or a bone conduction device aim to alleviate the impact of SSD by rerouting signals from the impaired ear to the better-hearing ear.5 In the past decade, we have seen the introduction of cochlear implantation,6 which restores hearing by delivering information directly to the impaired side, thus creating a sensation of true binaural hearing. TREATMENT CHALLENGES The challenge faced by people diagnosed with SSD, health care professionals, and clinical researchers is understanding which intervention (if any) is ideal.7 How can we measure the benefits or harms associated with an intervention for SSD? Existing literature has highlighted inconsistencies in the benefits and risks (side effects), or outcome domains, assessed when evaluating these interventions. For example, clinical studies that evaluate these interventions have measured performances such as speech perception in quiet or noisy environments and sound localization. Studies have also assessed tinnitus symptom severity and quality of life. The tests (measurement instruments) that researchers have chosen to measure these effects also vary widely from study to study. For example, sound localization can be measured using a setup of four loudspeakers arranged at the front, back, and sides (90 degrees apart) or a more complex setup of six loudspeakers arranged in a semi-circle in front of the participant (30 degrees apart). This diversity of chosen measures poses a challenge to both health care users and professionals when comparing and contrasting various study outcomes. In some cases, researchers choose available measures because they are standardized or easily accessible, and not because of their importance to health care users or professionals themselves. ADDRESSING THE INCONSISTENCY Identifying appropriate outcome domains is crucial to designing clinical trials to evaluate the effects of various interventions for SSD.8 Selected outcomes need to be vital and tailored to key stakeholders such as health care users, professionals, or budget holders to minimize bias when making decisions about health care.9 Furthermore, the choice of outcome measures should be based on what is important and of interest to people making decisions about health care, not on what outcome instruments are available or most commonly used. The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative just celebrated its 10th anniversary. The network brings together researchers interested in the development of agreed and standardized sets of outcomes, known as core outcome sets. Part of the COMET work focuses on developing recommendations on minimum standards for the design of core outcome set (COS) studies.10 A COS is a recommendation of what should be measured and reported in all trials in a specific area as a minimum. If developed from the perspectives of all relevant stakeholders, a COS can overcome the problems imposed by the utilization of diverse measures. In the field of audiology and ENT, a group led by Professor Deborah A. Hall at the University of Nottingham has developed a COS for tinnitus.11 Professor Iain A. Bruce and his team at the NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre are working on the PONCHO study: Prioritizing Outcomes iN Childhood Hearing lOss. THE CROSSSD STUDY The Core Rehabilitation Outcome Set for Single-Sided Deafness (CROSSSD) project is an international initiative that aims to develop a COS for SSD interventions. It aims to find an agreement on what outcomes are critical and should always be measured when evaluating interventions for SSD, using the methodology proposed by the COMET initiative. We have an advisory group of clinical professionals from the United Kingdom, United States, and Europe. The CROSSSD project also works closely with people who have lived experience of SSD. They have been integral to the design and delivery of the CROSSSD study. For example, a promotional video (http://bit.ly/2QbLJk) was developed alongside collaborators with lived experience of SSD to increase awareness of the project and help with global participant recruitment. Our methodology is as follows (Fig. 1): Systematic review of the published literature reporting interventions for SSD to identify the outcome domains and measurement instruments that have already been used.12 Workshops using a range of qualitative methods to explore patient perspectives on outcomes. Interactive online consensus exercise, known as a Delphi survey, with key stakeholders to identify which outcome domains are important when evaluating SSD interventions. Interactive consensus meeting with a subgroup of the key stakeholders to discuss the Delphi survey findings and recommend a minimum set of outcome domains that are relevant to all. So far, we have completed the systematic review of the literature. From 72 papers, we identified a total of 244 outcome domains. Many of these were duplicates or not directly relevant to SSD, and so we were able to produce a shortened list of 44 unique candidate outcome domains. The Delphi survey engaged 277 participants from 30 countries. They suggested five additional candidate outcome domains. The e-Delphi concluded in February 2020 and the CROSSSD team are currently preparing for the interactive consensus meeting to finalize the core outcome domain set. FUTURE STEPS Once a COS is developed, we would know what is important to measure in all studies; however researchers also need to consider how the included outcomes should be measured. The COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) international initiative has collaborated with the COMET initiative to develop guidelines for selecting outcome measurement instruments for outcomes included in a COS.13 For instance, if quality of life is an outcome in a COS, indicated to be critical and important to always measure for SSD interventions, COSMIN standards can help us establish what commonly agreed instrument or questionnaire everyone should utilize to measure it. Appropriate dis emination strategies14 will ensure that anyone designing a trial in this area will have a list of outcomes to measure as a minimum, alongside a list of recommended instruments to utilize. The COS will not prevent researchers from measuring additional outcomes or utilizing supplementary instruments. Future studies in the field should adopt the recommended COS to reduce the heterogeneity of measures utilized. Moreover, only outcomes meaningful to all stakeholders will be employed and, as a result, transparency will be established since both benefits and harms will be reported. Clinical researchers will be supported in thinking critically about what they are trying to measure, and they will not select their outcomes simply based on the popularity or accessibility of available instruments. Uptake of the COS will be encouraged internationally to improve research quality, enhance clinical decision-making, and facilitate meta-analysis in systematic reviews.

This chapter emphasizes, is a dynamic process and not a static occurrence. It discusses a variety of concerns that develop immediately following the death—and frequently preceding it—and that continue, although often with diminishing intensity and frequency, for an extended period of time. These are physical and health changes, psychological and emotional distress, social and relational concerns, and practical issues.",

Some of these problems may be due to existences of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, a condition that affects over 10% of the population, or due to restless leg syndrome (RLS)/periodic leg movement syndrome (PLMS), sleep-related involuntary leg movements often associated with an abnormal sensation in legs. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), parasomnia, and sleep problems associated with medical/psychiatric conditions are also common. Narcolepsy is a primary EDS disorder affecting about 0.05% of the population. EDS is also often secondary to a severe insomnia associated with obstructive sleep apnea.",

      "abstract": "Considerable attention has been paid to individuals showing social maladjustment as well as withdrawal from social situations and activity, a state referred to as \"Hikikomori\" in Japanese. Recently, social maladjustment and Hikikomori states have also been noted to be highly prevalent among individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), which involve abnormalities in social interactions and communication. The individuals with PDDs report a tendency to sleep and wake at irregular or inappropriate times and to suffer from sleep disorders by nature, and they tend to sleep at extreme late night or during the day while experiencing social maladjustment and Hikikomori states. Therefore, it is probable that their oral hygiene might deteriorate due to a circadian rhythm disorder, such as an abnormal salivary secretion rhythm or refusals and noncooperation of dental care due to mood/emotional and social problems, underlying and caused by their sleep and wake patterns. In this review, we describe the importance of regular lifestyle, especially regular sleep–wake rhythm with appropriately timed bright light exposure during daytime, for management of oral health in PDDs via improving their circadian rhythm disorders.",

      "title": "Neuroanatomical and Etiological Approaches to Secondary Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

There are many physiological changes in sleep such as fall in blood pressure, decrease in heart rate, reduction in pH of the blood, reduction in urine secretion, decrease in metabolic rate, slow and regular breathing, muscular relaxation and the disappearance of deep reflex actions, but almost any of these physiological changes may be absent in a sleep which is normal in all other respects. It is therefore more accurate to refer to the physiological accompaniments than to the physiology of sleep (Gillespie, 1929).",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness. This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed.",

MSDs can interfere with activities at work and can lead to reduced productivity, sickness absence and chronic occupational disability [1].",

      "abstract": "Sleep starts, also known as hypnic or hypnagogic jerks, are a physiological accompaniment to falling asleep [1]. They are brief body jerks mainly bilateral and sometimes asymmetric. When sleep starts are excessive, they are considered a parasomnia and included in the category of sleep-wake transition parasomnias by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders [2]. They can cause frequent awakenings and sleep onset difficulty. The syndrome was first described by S Weir Mitchell [3]. This peculiar type of event consists of a massive myoclonic jerk in which the main muscles involved are the axial ones. Sleep starts can be accompanied by a dream, or the impression of falling. Epileptic seizures and parasomnias are the two major groups of sleep-related paroxysmal disorders in childhood. Epileptic seizures are usually characterized by random occurrence, stereotyped behavior, brief duration, and hypertonus or clonic jerks [4]. The pathogenesis of sleep starts is unknown. However, they involve partial activation of the central nervous system producing skeletal muscle activity. This could arise as a consequence of a synchronous volleys of pyramidal tract activity arising during the transition from wakefulness to sleep [5]. However, the involvement of axial muscles, the possible reflex origin, and",

The average person has also been significantly impacted by changes in the timing of their sleep and wakefulness, as well as by the absence of physical activity and the inclusion of outside junk foods in their diet. Ayurvedic scriptures identify ahara, nidra, and vyayam as the three sub-pillars of life. More specifically, ahara refers to one's nutrition; nidra refers to one's sleeping habits; and vyayam refers to one's physical activity. The consequences of living in such an unhealthy manner are seen in individuals today in the form of a wide variety of diseases, both mental and physical. The constant overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system has also had a deleterious impact on the quality of sleep. Alterations to one's lifestyle, together with consistent yoga practice, may be useful in reversing the course of this worsening illness and enhancing the health and well-being of the general population.",

Wanneer slaapgebrek een chronisch probleem wordt zouden er wel eens veranderingen in hersenen en lichaam kunnen optreden die ernstige gevolgen hebben voor de psychische en fysieke gezondheid. Zo is er vaak gesuggereerd dat verstoorde slaap kan bijdragen aan het ontstaan van stemmingsstoornissen als depressie. In dit proefschrift worden studies beschreven naar de neurobiologische gevolgen van chronische slaaptekort in ratten. De dagelijkse hoeveelheid slaap werd tot minder dan de helft gereduceerd en in de weken daarna werden de gevolgen bestudeerd voor hersensystemen en hormonale processen die mogelijk betrokken zijn bij depressie. Hoewel een enkele dag van slaaptekort nog geen effecten had op deze systemen, waren er na een week al duidelijk veranderingen meetbaar in de gevoeligheid voor de neurotransmitter serotonine en in de regulatie van de hypofyse-bijnier as, het hormonale systeem dat betrokken is bij de reactie op stress. Na een maand van slaaptekort traden er zelfs morfologische veranderingen op in het brein. Er was een duidelijke afname in de grootte van de hippocampus, een hersengebied dat een belangrijke rol speelt bij de regulatie van emoties en cognitieve processen. Veel van de waargenomen neurobiologische en hormonale veranderingen na chronisch slaaptekort in ratten komen sterk overeen met afwijkingen die zijn vastgesteld bij depressieve patienten. De resultaten van deze studies leveren dan ook een sterke ondersteuning van de hypothese dat verstoorde slaap niet enkel een symptoom is van depressie maar, bij een deel van de patienten, mogelijk een causale rol speelt bij het ontstaan van de stemmingsstoornis.",

      "title": "JET LAG SYNDROME: CURRENT INSIGHT AND REVIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE",
      "abstract": "The jet lag syndrome is a phenomenon of modern social life that occurs due to a mismatch between the body's natural circadian rhythm and the external environment due to rapid travel across multiple time zones. Jet lag syndrome symptoms are primarily related to sleep disturbance, interfering with travellers' social life and vocational performance. The symptoms usually last for a few days but can be for a week depending upon the changes in time zones. During the jet lag, abrupt shifts in the environmental light-dark cycle temporarily desynchronize the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus downstream oscillatory networks from each other, resulting in increased sleepiness and impaired daytime functioning. Eastward travel is associated with a longer duration of jet lag than westward travel. Polysomnographic data show that jet lag results in changes in sleep-wake timing and different aspects of sleep architecture. This circadian misalignment can lead to a cluster of symptoms, including signicant metabolic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, and neurological impairments.[1] Light is the major entrainment factor for the circadian clock, and timed bright light exposure at the appropriate portion of the light-dark cycle is the principal non-pharmacological approach. Nutraceuticals and pharmacological therapies include melatonin, melatonin receptor analogues (agonists), non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents, caffeine, diphenhydramine (e.g., Benadryl, McNeil; Aler-Dryl, Reese), and armodanil. The awareness about the jet lag syndrome, planned sleep schedule before departure and phase resetting by exposure to light or medication can help travellers overcome this condition. New research suggests that modication of clock function via genetic manipulation may one day have clinical applications.[2] The current perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in many countries imposing a lockdown, reducing sunlight exposure and altering daily social schedules. Therefore, it essentially leads to changing 'time zones' without actually travelling across time zones, causing social jet lag.[3]",

Las vias del dolor transmiten la informacion nociceptiva a traves del sistema nervioso periferico y central y estan plenamente integradas con el sistema motor y simpatico a nivel medular y de los centros nerviosos superiores y dan lugar a actividad motora refleja, hiperactividad simpatica y respuestas afectivas y conductuales. Objetivo : Definir los mecanismos fisiopatologicos que se desencadenan en presencia de dolor agudo y las alteraciones que consecuentemente generan en diferentes organos y sistemas. Desarrollo : Las respuestas generadas a nivel segmentario, suprasegmentario y cortical dan lugar a alteraciones fisiopatologicas en el sistema cardiovascular, respiratorio y en otros organos y sistemas. Estas alteraciones pueden modificar negativamente el curso de la lesion o enfermedad que origino el dolor y provocar graves trastornos hemodinamicos que pueden llevar a la muerte del paciente. Conclusiones : Aunque el dolor agudo tiene una funcion biologica protectora, cuando es persistente o no mitigado provoca alteraciones fisiopatologicas en los diferentes organos y sistemas que son nocivas para el paciente.

Refreshing sleep requires both quality and quantity, so much so that an inadequacy of either leads to overall higher mortality rates. Numerous studies have sited significant changes in sleep that typically occur with aging and primary sleep disorders are more common in the elderly than in younger patients. As many as half of persons over 65 have some complaint relating to sleep. There is a high prevalence of insomnia in the elderly population and elderly patients also frequently suffer from sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, periodic leg movement disorder, circadian rhythm disturbances, narcolepsy, and rapid eye movement behavior disorder. Unfortunately, sleep problems in the elderly are often mistakenly considered a normal part of aging. The aim of this article is to review normal sleep, sleep and the major causes of sleep disturbances in the elderly. Attention has been given to diagnosis and appropriate interventions, since sleep disturbances left untreated can have significant negative impact in terms of life expectancy, general health outcome and quality of life.

On investigation, both had dysacusis, absent middle latency evoked responses, acoustic errors in sound recognition and matching, inconsistent auditory behaviours, and similarly disturbed psychoacoustic discrimination tasks. These findings indicate that the different clinical syndromes caused by cortical auditory lesions form a spectrum of related auditory processing disorders.

A recent finding that 18 patients’ manic-depressive cycles oscillated in synchrony with biweekly surges in amplitude of the moon’s tides provided a clue to the cause of the sleep-disturbances. Analyses of one of the patients’ sleep–wake cycles suggest that his mood cycles arose when a circadian rhythm that normally is entrained to dawn and controls the daily onset of wakefulness became entrained instead to 24.8-h recurrences of every second 12.4-h tidal cycle. The finding provides the basis for a comprehensive description of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the mood cycle.",

Primary headaches have no identifiable underlying cause whilst secondary headaches have an underlying pathology. Delirium is a more specific term for an acute episode of fluctuating altered mental status. Altered mental status may herald the onset of a life-threatening or of a reversible condition. Symptoms of weakness include difficulty with activity of daily livings or problems with gait and loss of balance. Tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic and oscillatory movement involving one or more body parts. Abnormal gait is when a person is unable to walk in their usual way.",

When this situation causes a significant impairment, it's called circadian rhythm sleep The underlying pathophysiology involves either a dysfunction of the endogenous clock (located in the Suprachiasmathic nucleus of the hypothalamus) or a failure of the mechanisms of environmental synchronization (involving the retina and retino-hypothalamic tract). The principal clinical syndromes are: delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS), irregular sleep-wake rhythm, free-running disorder, jet lag disorder and shift work disorder. The treatment requires resynchronization of the endogenous clock with environmental clues. Some useful alternatives include timed exposure to bright light, melatonin and physical activity, associated to correct sleep hygiene. In some cases, the intermittent use of stimulants (caffeine, modafinil) and hypnotics may be useful for symptom relief, but only for short periods.",

EEG measures give some indication of the pattern of sleepiness in relation to shift work, that is, incidents of sleep intrusions are frequently seen during the second half of a night shift. If sleepiness is as pronounced as suggested in connection with night work, there should be a link with performance errors and accidents. Shift work that includes night shifts causes high levels of sleepiness that may constitute a major safety risk, particularly in transport work, but also in health care and industry.

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders (CRSWD) are sleep dysfunctions related to circadian functioning. They are characterized by symptoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness that occur because the intrinsic circadian pacemaker is not entrained to a 24-h light/dark cycle. Affected individuals with a free-running disorder or hypernycthemeral syndrome (N24SWD) have a longer sleep–wake cycle that produces a sleep pattern that typically delays each day. The disorder is seen in 70% of blind people, and among people with healthy vision, it is a rare pathology. Among sighted cases, 80% are young men and 28% have a psychiatric disorder. The patient was a 14-year-old boy with a psychiatric pathology diagnosed with a PANDAS syndrome (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci), a sudden acute and debilitating onset of intense anxiety and mood lability accompanied by obsessive compulsive-like issues and/or tics, in association with a streptococcal A infection that occurs immediately prior to the symptoms. As a comorbidity, he exhibited severe insomnia due to an irregular sleep pattern that strongly delayed his sleep schedule day to day. It affected his daily routines, as he was not going to school, and aggravated, furthermore, the psychiatric symptoms. He was referred for sleep consultation, where the case was explored by ambulatory circadian monitoring (ACM) using the novel system Kronowise ® (Chronolab, University of Murcia) and diagnosed with a non-24-h sleep–wake disorder (N24SWD). The first treatment approach for the patient was focused on improving symptoms during the acute infection and psychiatric symptoms. Additionally, sleep pathology was treated by light therapy and melatonin. After 8 months and different trials, it was possible to establish a treatment to normalize the symptoms and fix his sleep rhythm in a normal schedule as well as to reduce anxious symptoms during the day. The association of PANDAS and N24SWD has not previously been reported in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Increased daytime napping, early morning awakening, frequent nocturnal sleep interruptions, and lowered amplitude and phase advance of the circadian sleep-wake rhythm are characteristic features of sleep-waking and chronobiological changes associated with aging. Especially in elderly patients with dementia, severely fragmented sleep-waking patterns are observed frequently and are associated with disorganized circadian rhythm of various physiological functions. Functional and/or organic deterioration of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), decreased exposure to time cues such as insufficient social interaction and reduced environmental light, lowered sensitivity of sensory organs to time cues, and reduced ability of peripheral effector organs to express circadian rhythms may cause these chronobiological changes. In many cases of dementia, the usual treatments for insomnia do not work well, and the development of an effective therapy is an important concern for health care practitioner and researchers. Recent therapeutical trials of supplementary administration of artificial bright light and the pineal hormone melatonin, a potent synchronizer for mammalian circadian rhythm, have indicated that these treatments are useful tools for demented elderly insomniacs. Both bright light and melatonin simultaneously ameliorate disorganized thermoregulatory and neuroendocrine systems associated with disrupted sleep-waking times, suggesting a new, potent therapeutic means for insomnia in the demented elderly. Future studies should address the most effective therapeutic design and the most suitable types of symptoms for treatment and investigate the use of these tools in preventive applications in persons in early stages of dementia.

      "abstract": "In noise effect research often the awakening reaction is maintained to be the only important health related reaction. The main argument is that sleep represents a trophotropic phase (\"energy storing\"). In contrast to this awakening reactions or lying awake belong to the ergotropic phase (\"energy consuming\"). Frequent or long awakening reactions endanger therefore the necessary recovery in sleep and, in the long-run, health. Findings derived from arousal and stress hormone research make possible a new access to the noise induced nightly health risk. An arousal is a short change in sleeping condition, raising the organism from a lower level of excitation to a higher one. Arousals have the function to prevent life-threatening influences or events through activation of compensation mechanisms. Frequent occurrences of arousal triggered by nocturnal noise leads to a deformation of the circadian rhythm. Additionally, the deep sleep phases in the first part of the night are normally associated with a minimum of cortisol and a maximum of growth hormone concentrations. These circadian rhythms of sleep and neuroendocrine regulation are necessary for the physical as well as for the psychic recovery of the sleeper. Noise exposure during sleep which causes frequent arousal leads to decreased performance capacity, drowsiness and tiredness during the day. Long-term disturbances of the described circadian rhythms have a deteriorating effect on health, even when noise induced awakenings are avoided.",

      "abstract": "The daily rhythm of cortisol secretion is relatively stable and primarily under the influence of the circadian clock. Nevertheless, several other factors affect hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Sleep has modest but clearly detectable modulatory effects on HPA axis activity. Sleep onset exerts an inhibitory effect on cortisol secretion while awakenings and sleep offset are accompanied by cortisol stimulation. During waking, an association between cortisol secretory bursts and indices of central arousal has also been detected. Abrupt shifts of the sleep period induce a profound disruption in the daily cortisol rhythm, while sleep deprivation and/or reduced sleep quality seem to result in a modest but functionally important activation of the axis. HPA hyperactivity is clearly associated with metabolic, cognitive and psychiatric disorders and could be involved in the well-documented associations between sleep disturbances and the risk of obesity, diabetes and cognitive dysfunction. Several clinical syndromes, such as insomnia, depression, Cushing's syndrome, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) display HPA hyperactivity, disturbed sleep, psychiatric and metabolic impairments. Further research to delineate the functional links between sleep and HPA axis activity is needed to fully understand the pathophysiology of these syndromes and to develop adequate strategies of prevention and treatment.",

This chapter provides an understanding of the factors which impair sleep quality in women as they age and presents a framework for their clinical management. The function of sleep in large part remains unexplained, although it is appreciated that sleep is ubiquitous among the animal kingdom. In women, the physiologic changes associated with the menopause provide an additional potential impediment to normal sleep processes. A range of environmental changes that accompany aging are likely to contribute to changes in sleep. Epidemiological evidence to support the relationship between decreased activities and sleep disturbance is lacking. The use of alcohol is a common and often overlooked cause of sleep disturbance. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder affecting all age groups, and is particularly prevalent in the elderly.

      "abstract": "The amount, timing, and structure of REM sleep are regulated. Three major determinants in REM sleep regulation have been identified: (1) the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which through its outputs generates daily cycles in REM sleep propensity; (2) a homeostatic (i.e., need-based) drive for REM sleep that increases in the absence of REM sleep and decreases during its presence; (3) the inhibition of REM sleep by non-REM (NREM) sleep. In humans, the circadian modulation of REM sleep shows a maximum shortly after the nadir of the circadian rhythm of core body temperature. A sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep (i.e., a gradual increase of REM sleep in the course of a sleep episode that is distinct from a circadian influence) is also evident and attributed primarily to the decrease in NREM sleep intensity. The circadian rhythm and the sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep are the dominant factors influencing the distribution of REM sleep within a sleep episode. In humans that are normally entrained to the 24-hour day, the interaction of these two factors results in maximal REM sleep propensity in the morning, coinciding with habitual wake time. The homeostatic regulation counteracts deviations from a reference level of REM sleep need such that loss of REM sleep results in increased REM sleep propensity. However, rebounds in REM sleep following selective deprivation often remain partial suggesting that the homeostatic drive is relatively weak. On the other hand, recent studies have emphasized that REM sleep can undergo changes in its quality that may compensate for its loss in duration. In the present chapter, the evidence for circadian and homeostatic regulation of REM sleep will be reviewed, the physiological markers that are indicative of such regulation will be presented, and the interdependence of REM sleep and NREM sleep regulation will be examined.",

      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia has been linked to a variety of contributing variables, including as psychological training, genetic predispositions, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes, and cognitive and physiological arousal. The hyper-arousal theory of insomnia postulates that sleep disturbances are caused by an increase in physiological arousal based on the discovery of high physiological arousal, which may be connected to these people's active stress system. Sometimes, sleep issues including difficulties getting asleep, difficulty remaining asleep, or having poor-quality sleep are referred to as insomnia. Insomnia can be brought on by a variety of things, including the use of psychoactive drugs, caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, and cocaine; hormonal changes, such as menstruation and menopause; stressful life events, like the birth of a child and bereavement; disruptions of the circadian rhythm, like shift work and jet lag; some neurological disorders; and medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis. Everything in the universe vibrates at a specific frequency, and when we are in a state of natural resonance, we are in perfect health. But if a bodily component begins to vibrate at the incorrect frequency, the energy becomes trapped, and illness appears. In order to release the repressed energy and return resonance to its natural level, chanting can therefore be employed to affect a therapy.",

      "abstract": "It is widely recognized that sleep disorders (SD) are highly prevalent, despite being under diagnosed and under treated in practice. SDs occurs at all ages, although presentation and subsequent consequences for an individual's health varies throughout the lifespan. Currently, evaluation of SDs are inadequate across all age ranges, and for both sexes, as they are compromised by under reporting and relying on self-report, rather than professional sleep studies (i.e., nocturnal polysomnography (NPS) and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT)). Moreover, there is a paucity of data specific to the elderly; many older individuals report dissatisfaction with quality of sleep. Indeed, literature has shown that geriatric populations spend less time in slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and have more difficulties maintaining sleep. Their dissatisfaction may occur from changes in sleep architecture associated with the aging process; however, it has been suggested that it largely stems from comorbid illness, social problems, hormonal effects, altered circadian rhythms, or side effects of medications that are common in the elderly. Further, geriatric sleep is related to depression, impaired health and functioning, and weaker/ less synchronized circadian rhythms. In response, we utilized a 111-item questionnaire in conjunction with NPS, MSLT, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and medical chart reviews of individuals referred for SD evaluation to compare sleep in geriatrics with adults. Analysis revealed numerous differences between adult and geriatric groups, with the elderly experiencing more SDs, longer sleep latencies, and fewer sleep complaints. Based on the outcomes of this investigation, we posit further consideration to SDs across the age groups to achieve the best health care and quality of life for all.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This White Paper presents the results from a workshop cosponsored by the Sleep Research Society (SRS) and the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms (SRBR) whose goals were to bring together sleep clinicians and sleep and circadian rhythm researchers to identify existing gaps in diagnosis and treatment and areas of high-priority research in circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders (CRSWD). CRSWD are a distinct class of sleep disorders caused by alterations of the circadian time-keeping system, its entrainment mechanisms, or a misalignment of the endogenous circadian rhythm and the external environment. In these disorders, the timing of the primary sleep episode is either earlier or later than desired, irregular from day-to-day, and/or sleep occurs at the wrong circadian time. While there are incomplete and insufficient prevalence data, CRSWD likely affect at least 800,000 and perhaps as many as 3 million individuals in the United States, and if Shift Work Disorder and Jet Lag are included, then many millions more are impacted. The SRS Advocacy Taskforce has identified CRSWD as a class of sleep disorders for which additional high-quality research could have a significant impact to improve patient care. Participants were selected for their expertise and were assigned to one of three working groups: Phase Disorders, Entrainment Disorders, and Other. Each working group presented a summary of the current state of the science for their specific CRSWD area, followed by discussion from all participants. The outcome of those presentations and discussions are presented here.",

      "title": "Sleep: universal for all, problematic for some",
      "abstract": "Human sleep is a paradox that evades detailed understanding to a large extent. Despite the fact people sleep almost every night, and despite advances in the scientific understanding of sleep, most of us have no insight or even a basic understanding of what happens when we sleep. Poor sleep, or a perception of poor sleep, vexes many. Insomnia or sleep disturbance is a very common presentation in primary care, and the effect of insomnia may be trivialised, to some degree, in the primary care setting, contributing to a lack of support and a dearth of clear management guidelines.1 An understanding of sleep and sleep requirements across the human life cycle remains elusive. As the parents of a newborn child can often attest, babies usually need to sleep a lot, but it is relatively uncommon for the infant's sleep cycle to align with that of the parents. Conversely, older people often perceive that their sleep is poor, and up to 50% of older people complain about difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep.2 Although normal aging processes can account for some of that insomnia, medical or psychiatric diseases, including chronic pain, dementia, depression, sleep-disordered breathing and more, can also have a profound impact. In this edition of the Journal we see discussion of this important clinical issue in detail. The reality is that there are a good many drugs in the pharmacopoeia that have sedating properties, and generally these agents, when given at an adequate dose, will cause an older person to fall asleep. It is another question altogether as to whether that person will remain asleep for the desired duration of rest, whether the sleep achieved will be of good quality and will fulfil the physiological purposes required, or whether the medications will continue to work if administered on a longer-term basis. Moreover, by the time a healthcare professional of any discipline has completed their basic training and enters the workforce, it is virtually impossible not to have been comprehensively appraised of the potential adverse consequences of the use of hypnosedatives in the context of advanced age. Equally, it is well-nigh inconceivable not to have been thoroughly exposed to the worthy concept of dealing with sleep disturbance (particularly among older people) by addressing underlying causes. On this basis, it is really not plausible to argue that ignorance of some of the issues involved on the part of doctors, pharmacists and nurses is driving the persistent use of these medicines among older people. Epidemiologists, academics and even social commentators with no qualifications at all are building reputations and social media profiles from being the dispensers of wisdom about the inadvisability of resorting to drugs to address insomnia among the elderly, and who could blame them? Prima facie, it would appear almost impossible to advocate otherwise. Of course, were the matter to be as simple as is presented by some, there would be no older people with insomnia: all the underlying causes would be adroitly addressed, and our older generations would have sound and satisfying sleep of adequate duration every night; but this is very clearly not the case. The reality is that many of the underlying causes of sleep disturbance for older people are refractory to intervention, severe, progressive and, in some cases, irreversible. In one's seventh, eighth and ninth decades of life, sleep may not come as easily as it does to one in the flush of youth, but if the underlying causes cannot be remediated, should this be the basis to suggest that these older people should be consigned to endure sleep disturbance for the rest of their relatively brief time on the planet? The possible downside of pharmacotherapy for sleep disturbances affecting older people is a concept not lost upon any discerning clinician. There has recently been a huge raft of attention focusing upon the prescribing rates of sedating medications in settings like aged and extended care facilities. For example, the RedUSe study, well-designed and conducted with rigour, conclusively demonstrated that the proportion of residents in aged care facilities prescribed antipsychotics and benzodiazepines can be reduced by the implementation of a multifaceted intervention.3 The nuances can be debated ad infinitum, but the fact remains that although the intervention reduced the prescribing of a potentially hazardous group of drugs, the long-term outcomes (both clinical and economic) associated with doing so were not assessed. Proponents will point to the prevention of possible harm associated with a higher rate of usage were the intervention not implemented, but of course, in the absence of measurement of long-term clinical outcomes, we cannot be sure. In the meantime, other parameters that escaped measurement included those related to quality of life, injuries that may arise because of agitated behaviour and consumer preference. There can be no denying that hypnosedatives and other psychotropic drugs have the potential to cause harm for older people but, like the case for other clinical situations, both sides of the equation warrant consideration. There are dozens of examples of widely used drugs with serious adverse effects that are more common among the elderly, but it is of interest that hypnosedatives have been singled out for special attention. Like the starting position established for the construct of the RedUSe study, the respected Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults4 make it very clear that the learned consensus panel assembled to determine the ratings considers that benzodiazepines and antipsychotics should be avoided for older people if possible. By contrast, the guidance provided in relation to anticoagulants is less strongly worded than for benzodiazepines – an interesting observation, given that on the basis of per capita usage rates, it could be argued that the former drugs create more iatrogenic harm for the elderly than the latter. To be clear, this point is not made here to argue that hypnosedatives or anticoagulants should be either used or avoided for older people: that is a matter for much wiser people than this commentator. However, it is reasonable to point out that there appears to be a kind of societal overlay applied in the consideration of medicines used for sleep. It is interesting to consider that the people who publish guidance and provide commentary about what is and is not appropriate in terms of the medicines prescribed to assist older people with sleep are almost always younger people, yet to experience the decline in sleep quality and duration that often accompanies older age, but as Joni Mitchell once sang, ‘you don't know what you've got 'till it's gone’. As is the case for all medicines, it is important that the use of hypnosedatives for older people is guided with a conservative hand intent on averting avoidable harm; but, at the same time, it is also important not to dismiss the importance of a good night's rest. An Irish proverb suggests that ‘a good laugh and a long sleep are the best cures in the doctor's book’. Perhaps that prescription may be written more often? The author declares that he has no conflicts of interest.",

      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

      "title": "Supporting Sleep Health and Chronic Care Management Information for Patient Self-Care",
      "abstract": "Sleep health is a multidimensional concept affected by multiple cognitive, environmental, and physiological factors, including the circadian rhythm. Poor sleep health causes short-term impairment to cognition, emotional regulation and mood, and functional performance. Poor sleep health is also implicated in long-term adverse health outcomes such as mental health conditions, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Circadian rhythms that are desynchronized with desired sleep-wake schedules are both causes and outcomes of chronic conditions affecting cognitive and physical functioning and interactions. Conditions like fibromyalgia, mood disorders, type I diabetes, and post-concussive syndrome disproportionately affect women. Unfortunately, current physiological monitoring technologies do not support real-time assessment of the circadian rhythm, especially in everyday contexts (i.e., outside a sleep lab). This gap complicates circadian misalignment detection and severely limits timeliness and effectiveness of interventions and patient self-care efforts. This paper explores the system dynamics associated with a continuous physiological monitoring system that tracks the circadian rhythm via melatonin levels. Melatonin fluctuations and subsequent circadian phase shifts due to environmental time-cues, as well as interactions between circadian misalignment and other chronic conditions, represent feedback control and homeostasis loops affecting the patient. A continuous melatonin monitor and patient-facing display would support patient self-care through enhanced health literacy and situation awareness regarding their current and projected future states. These capabilities will enable timely, effective interventions and patient-led supervisory control actions to improve sleep health and thus ultimately enhance overall patient condition.",

Attention to these symptoms such as fatigue, depression, sleep disturbances, and autonomic and cardiac abnormalities require awareness and early recognition, a multidisciplinary team of caregivers, and a systematic stepwise management approach. Because of the complexity of these symptoms, a holistic approach to the patient from physical, psychological, and social aspects is mandatory for a better quality of life and functional capacity.",

      "title": "Normal Variations in Auditory Acuity",
      "abstract": "Normal variations in auditory acuity are an important factor in all studies of sound and hearing. In the presence of a normal sound-conductive mechanism, these variations originate either in the cerebral processes involved in hearing, or in the end-organ of hearing, the cochlear mechanism. Variations in auditory acuity of central origin, such as variations due to the state of attention of variations in the sleeping state, have not been thoroughly studied. They primarily involve the perception of sound. Disease of the perceptive mechanism of hearing, as in the presence of brain tumor or meningitis, gives rise to “central” deafness. Though little attention has been directed by modern otology to the differentiation of “central” deafness and deafness due to disease changes in the inner ear, there are a number of signs available for this differentiation. Variations in auditory acuity of peripheral origin may be caused by many factors, such as barometric pressure, general bodily and circulatory tone and others; but the most interesting is the variation due to continued stimulation of the ear with sound. Whereas the mental processes involved in hearing perception show fatigue, as manifested by the determination by many observers of an increased differential of intensity, the end-organs of the normal ear do not fatigue on prolonged stimulation with moderate intensities of a frequency. On the contrary, prolonged stimulation of the ear with a moderate intensity of a frequency increases auditory acuity for that frequency, as is manifested by a drop in the threshold of intensity for that frequency by as much as 10 to 20 dbs. These variations in auditory acuity are of high significance in the differentiation between deafness of peripheral and central deafness, which is thus for the first time made possible. For in the presence of peripheral deafness of the progressive type, the hearing shows marked fatigue on prolonged stimulation and a rise in threshold, as contrasted with the drop in threshold in the normal ear. In cases afflicted with central deafness there is found frequently a normal response of the ear to prolonged stimulation, pointing to normality of the ear and the end-organ and the central nervous nature of the disease process. The experience of one of us (Dr. Josephson) stresses the importance of this differentiation in cases of deafness; for he has found about 20 per cent of the cases referred to him with diagnosis by competent otologists of progressive deafness to be deafness symptomatic of tumor or disease of the brain.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

It causes a relative lack of breathing and sleeping that bodes disaster for the patient. Alternately breathing and not breathing, the afflicted sleeper struggles to inspire through an obstructed upper airway or, more correctly, an occluded oropharynx. He repeatedly experiences episodic hypoxemia, which, in turn, disrupts his sleep. (This use of the male pronoun is convenient and correct, statistically; OSA is rare in women.) Obstructive sleep apnea is a multisystem disorder involving metabolic, respiratory, and neural abnormalities. The cause of the airway obstruction is multifaceted and includes the following: structural encroachment on the oropharyngeal lumen, subatmospheric intrapharyngeal pressure, and hypotonicity of oropharyngeal muscles. Similarly, secondary disease manifestations appear in multiple systems; respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, and hypersomnolence are characteristic of severe OSA, and this complex is usually referred to",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

Circadian (ca 24 h) rhythms are driven by an internal clock situated in the hypothalamus. Without time cues, they deviate from 24 h and assume a periodicity of, on average, 24.3 h. Periodicity is inherited, and progress has recently been made in identifying 'clock' genes. Circadian rhythms are synchronised to the 24-h day mostly by light-dark cycles and social time cues. Suitably timed bright light and the pineal hormone melatonin will change the timing of circadian rhythms and can be used to treat biological rhythm disorders, whether occupational or pathological. Rhythm disorder is usually manifested as sleep problems, but some major pathology (eg cardiovascular disease) is associated with frequent rhythm disruption as found in shift workers. Menstrual cycle variations are clearly of importance, and even human seasonality must be taken into consideration. Many drugs show rhythmic variations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea is a state-dependent syndrome. It is characterized by repeated collapse of the upper airway as the result of the loss of waking neuromuscular drive as the brain changes from wakefulness to sleep. This produces a state-dependent decrease in muscle tone, which, together with other predisposing factors such as obesity and anatomical narrowing of the upper airway, results in the spectrum of sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing describes the continuum from simple snoring (pharyngeal vibration), to flow limitation (hypopnea), to complete cessation of breathing (apnea). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the common description of what is now appreciated as the sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. The cardinal symptoms are snoring, observed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The immediate physical consequences are hypoxia, repeated sympathetic discharges, increased cardiac load, and repeated brain arousals. The repetitive arousals are required to restore airway patency, resulting in severely fragmented sleep and consequent sleep deprivation. The syndrome, untreated, produces significant cognitive and cardiorespiratory morbidity, and potential mortality. Compared to matched controls, patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea use twice the health resources and spend double the health-care dollars in the 10 years prior to diagnosis. Both trends are reversed by successful treatment. It is by definition a sleep-related illness and can be observed and evaluated only when the patient is asleep. Polysomnography is the laboratory procedure to study sleep and its protean dysfunctions. Multiple physiologic parameters are required to document the various types of sleep disorders as well as to establish the origin of pathologic sleep fragmentation. Complete polysomnography includes (but is not limited to) electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram ((EOG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory effort, air flow, and oxygen saturation. Treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, uvulopalatal and/or maxillomandibular surgery, positional control, and weight loss. The efficacy of each depends on the individual anatomy and the severity of the sleep-disordered breathing. CPAP is accepted as the most reliable treatment regardless of anatomy and severity. It is currently the only treatment modality which can be titrated during sleep and requires simultaneous polysomnography.",

Pendant le sommeil paradoxal, les taux des deux derniers chutent drastiquement, ce qui pourrait entraîner, directement ou indirectement, la désorganisation des structures corticales et sous corticales, les anomalies de l’excitabilité centrale, ainsi que la baisse du flux sanguin dans le cortex préfrontal dorsolatéral.

De plus, la baisse de la dopamine dans le cortex préfrontal en sommeil paradoxal, mise en évidence par l’expérimentation animale, permet à présent d’établir un lien de cause à effet entre ce déficit dopaminergique et l’altération du jugement critique rencontrée tant dans le rêve que dans la schizophrénie.

      "title": "Defining, Assessing, and Treating Adolescent Insomnia and Related Sleep Problems",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a time of change with many of these changes influencing sleep intrinsically and volitionally. Neuroendocrine and structural changes to the brain result in adolescents experiencing a delay in their circadian phase. Despite their intrinsic delay and progressively later bedtimes, adolescents' sleep need of 9.2 h remains stable as they develop. Female adolescents experience an increased risk for insomnia following menarche onset. Associations between the menstrual cycle and sleep disturbances have been found in studies of adult women, but more research needs to fully explore this relationship in adolescent females. Along with biological changes, adolescents experience an increase in social demands and responsibilities as they mature. The result is adaptation of the \"typical\" adolescent sleep schedule. For many adolescents, this new schedule results in a truncation of their sleep time that creates a sleep debt never fully repaid on the weekends. Numerous studies note a reduction in total sleep time following the transition into adolescence, particularly during the school year. The numerous factors that present during adolescence place adolescents at a greater risk for sleep disorders like insomnia, delayed sleep phase disorder, inadequate sleep hygiene, and behavioral sleep restriction. These disorders are associated with daytime consequences like daytime sleepiness, depressed mood, attention/concentration difficulties, and academic difficulties. The current chapter highlights insomnia, delayed sleep phase disorder, inadequate sleep hygiene, and behavioral sleep restriction with a focus on defining, assessing, differentiating, and treatment.",

OCD is a chronic and long-lasting disorder with a variety of different types of obsessions and compulsions. The obsessions (repeated thoughts, urges or mental images) include the fear of germs or contamination, aggressive thoughts towards self and others, and unwanted forbidden or taboo thoughts involving sex, religion and harm. The compulsions (repetitive behaviours) include excessive cleaning and/or handwashing, arranging things in a symmetrical or in a perfect order, repeatedly checking on things and compulsive counting. Both obsessional thoughts and compulsion behaviours make an individual dysfunctional and significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions. The nature of intensity of these obsessions and compulsions may vary among those presenting with OCD and some individual may present with multiple obsessions of aggressive, sexual and religious obsessions.",

A number of conditions are common during childhood but begin to improve as the child ages. The non-REM sleep parasomnias, including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors, are the most common in the pediatric category. Nightmares are also common in childhood but can occur at any age. Sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration are not found only in adults but are, in fact, quite common in the pediatric population.

      "abstract": "AbstractThe concept of homeostasis (i.e., constancy of the milieu interne) has long dominated the teaching and practice of medicine. Concepts and findings from chronobiology, the scientific study of biological rhythms, challenge this construct. Biological processes and functions are not at all constant; rather, they are organized in time as rhythms with period lengths that range in duration from as short as a second or less to as long as a year. It is the body's circadian (24h) rhythms that have been researched most intensely. The peak and trough of these rhythms are ordered rather precisely in time to support the biological requirements of activity during the day and sleep at night. The timing of the peak and trough plus the magnitude of variation (amplitude) of physiological and biochemical functions during the 24h give rise to predictable-in-time, day-night patterns in the manifestation and exacerbation of many common medical conditions. Circadian rhythms also can influence the response of patients to diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions according to their timing with reference to body rhythms. Rhythms in the pathophysiology of medical conditions and patient tolerance to medications constitute the basis for chronotherapeutics, the timing of treatment in relation to biological rhythm determinants as a means of optimizing beneficial effects and safety. The article discusses recent advances in medical chronobiology and chronotherapeutics and their relevance to clinical medicine in general and the management of asthma in particular. Indeed, since asthma is a disease that exhibits rather profound circadian rhythmicity, investigation of its pathophysiology and therapy necessitates a chronobiologic approach.Key Words: AsthmaChronobiologyChronopharmacologyChronotherapeutics",

      "abstract": "Daytime breathing problems caused by neurologic lesions always worsen during sleep, and in certain cases abnormal breathing patterns are only seen during sleep or specific sleep states. The first clinical manifestation of maltase deficiency, myopathy, or myotonic dystrophy is often a sleep-related complaint, such as unexplained waking from sleep (insomnia) or daytime somnolence. Thus, systematic investigation during sleep of disorders impairing the loop involved in breathing is strongly encouraged. Lesions may involve sensory receptors, sensory pathways, brainstem-controlling neurons, upper motor neurons, descending motor pathways, lower motor neurons, motor nerves, neuromuscular junctions, or respiratory muscles. Most of these lesions lead to a decrease in or absence of inspiratory efforts (diaphragmatic apnea or hypopnea) during sleep. These events differ from the classic obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the recently described upper airway resistance syndrome, which usually involve mild or significant anatomic abnormalities of the upper airway and craniofacial region. The treatment of abnormal breathing during sleep has been improved by the development of nasal ventilation methods: continuous positive airway pressure, intermittent positive pressure, and volume ventilation. These therapeutic approaches can prevent tracheostomy and diaphragmatic pacing and are more efficacious than drug treatments. Long-term compliance is generally much better in breathing disorders secondary to neurologic impairments than in cases of mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.",

      "title": "An Overview of Sleep Physiology and Sleep Regulation",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a complex behavior that cyclically alternates with wakefulness and is fundamental for both mental and physical wellness. During normal sleep the body acquires a specific posture; any active behavior is absent and mental activity typically oscillates between a state of \"loss of consciousness\" and the experience of dreaming. Sleep is, by itself, a cyclical process characterized by the alternation of two phases, non-REM (NREM) sleep and \"rapid eye movement\" (REM) sleep, during which the typical synchronized electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern of NREM sleep is substituted by a \"paradoxical\" EEG desynchronization. NREM sleep is a state of minimal energy expenditure and motor activity, during which cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory variables are driven by the autonomic nervous system at a lower and more stable level compared to wakefulness. During REM sleep, beyond the occurrence of REMs, posture control is lost and dreams become more vivid. Furthermore, autonomic activity is highly unstable leading to centrally driven surges in heart rate and blood pressure, breathing becomes irregular, and thermoregulation is suspended or depressed, suggesting a derangement of the integrative regulation of physiological functions. Overall sleep quality is one of the most important parameters considered for the subjective assessment of quality of life and general health status. However, although sleep function(s) is intuitively associated with some kind of rest that seems to be mostly required by the central nervous system, and many theories on sleep function have been proposed, a full comprehension of sleep function has not yet been achieved and is probably not imminent.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in pregnancy: Why and how should we manage them?",
      "abstract": "Maternal sleep quality worsens during pregnancy, already from the first trimester on and especially in the third trimester.1, 2 Nevertheless, the sleep quality is often ignored by both physicians as well as by women themselves as sleep quality is generally assumed to improve after delivery. However, sleep disturbances may continue during postpartum period or even become chronic. The most important sleep disturbances during pregnancy are primary insomnia, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome (RLS).2, 3 Sleep disturbances typically cause sleep fragmentation and deterioration of sleep architecture leading to sleep loss and daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue, cognitive difficulties and increase risk for accidents.2, 3 The algorithm of the diagnose and treatments of the most important sleep disturbances in pregnancy is illustrated in Figure 1. Primary insomnia includes both initiation insomnia, which shows as difficulties to fall asleep, and maintenance insomnia, which includes nightly awakenings and too early morning awakenings (being unable to fall asleep again). The etiology of primary insomnia during pregnancy is multifactorial, and might be associated with physical (hyperemesis, nocturia, joint and back pain, heartburn, nasal congestion, thermoregulatory problems, contractions, fetal movements, uncomfortable or unusual sleeping positions, dreams and nightmares) and mental (especially depression and anxiety) causes. Poor sleep quality has shown to be associated with the increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, prolonged labor and increased risk of cesarean section.2, 3 Constant snoring is a typical feature of SDB, which includes sleep apnea and partial upper airway obstruction. In pregnant women, SDB is often caused by partial upper airway obstruction rather than of episodes of frank obstructive apnea.2 Gestational weight gain and estrogen-induced hyperemia, mucosal edema and mucus hypersecretion lead to the narrowing of upper airways exacerbating the risk for SDB. However, progesterone-induced stimulation of breathing, sleeping in lateral position, and decrease in the duration of rapid eye movement sleep (during which breathing is more unstable) may protect against SDB. Furthermore, micrognatia and loose throat and larynx are important risk factors for SDB. In addition to snoring, other typical symptoms are headache and dry month in the morning and daytime sleepiness (most typically irresistible falling asleep when inactive). SDB has shown to be in association with increased risk for gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, cesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.2, 4 RLS is a nocturnal neurosensory movement disorder, which is connected with dopaminergic dysfunction. Although the etiology is still unclear, RLS may be idiopathic, genetic, or linked to various disorders, especially iron deficiency. RLS is characterized by unpleasant irritation, creeping, crawling, burning, pins-and-needles or itching sensations, most commonly in the legs. The sensations occur at rest and worsen towards the evening and night. Also smoking, use of caffeine, some medications or alcohol may initiate or exacerbate the symptoms. Transient RLS in previous pregnancies is associated with an elevated risk of new transient symptoms in future pregnancies, as well as with an increased risk for future development of chronic idiopathic RLS.2, 5 An association between RLS and hypertensive pregnancy disorders has been shown.2 Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are known risk factors for anxiety/depression both during pregnancy and postpartum period.1, 2, 6 Sleep disturbances often herald mood disturbances, and pregnant and postpartum women with mood symptoms typically suffer from sleep disturbances, especially from primary insomnia which may increase recurrence of a preexisting mental illness.6 Detection of the origin of the symptoms is the crucial first step in the management of maternal sleep disturbances. For the diagnosis of primary insomnia, questionnaires are feasible and sufficiently adequate tools in clinical practice. Because of the mismatch between subjective symptoms and objectively measured sleep quality, polysomnography, which measures sleep stages, is rarely needed.2 Of note is, that the patient may express having \"worse sleep quality\" or \"insomnia symptoms\", which may not stem from primary insomnia, but are secondary for instance for SDB (maintenance insomnia), RLS (initiation insomnia) or mental symptoms (initiation and maintenance insomnia). If SDB is suspected, ambulatory sleep polygraphy, which measures breathing and blood oxygen level is nessessary.2 In RLS, type and occurrence time of the symptoms and relief of the symptoms by movement, such as walking or stretching the limbs, are diagnostic. As iron deficiency may induce RLS, measurement of serum hemoglobin and ferritin (+C-reactive protein) is essential.5 To detect mental problems, especially depression and anxiety, structural questionnaires can be used.2 Good sleep hygiene is the basis of the treatment of all sleep disturbances. It includes convenient temperature in bedroom, reduced late fluid intake to prevent nocturia, suitable diet in case of gastro-esophageal reflux, massage in case of muscular pain and use of comfortable mattress and pillows. For primary insomnia non-pharmacologic treatments, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, is recommended and effective. It can be carried out as individual or group therapy. Additionally, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness, and exercise are safe and effective. In case of severe or persistent insomnia, a short-term use of sedatives (including sedative antihistamines), sleeping pills (especially benzodiazepine–like drugs) or low dose antidepressants (with sedative properties) can be prescribed after risks and benefits consideration. However, all these drugs pass the placenta and although no teratogenic effects has been shown, they may be harmful for fetus and new-born. A long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills should not be offered, since they often leads to noxious effects, like deterioration of sleep architecture and dependence on medication. Melatonin or herbal preparations, like valerian, are not recommended for treatment of insomnia during pregnancy or lactation because of the lack of safety and efficacy data. In cases of insomnia due to aggravating of mood symptoms, antidepressants, especially serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be warranted.2 The gold standard treatment for SDB is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and it is shown to be safe and effective also during pregnancy. After the diagnosis of SDB, CPAP treatment should be initiated without a delay. Positional treatment, especially lateral sleep posture, is recommendable. In general rule, surgical procedures should not be performed during pregnancy for the treatment of SDB. Local nasal congestive and corticosteroid treatments reduce nasal mucosal edema and thus improve nasal ventilation. In addition, treating respiratory infections effectively and gastro-esophageal reflux with tilted position of the upper body while in bed or proton-pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are also important.2 For the treatment of RLS, per oral iron supplementation (accompanied with C-vitamin for better iron absorption; serum ferritin level <75 μg/L) is recommended. However, in severe RLS (and with serum ferritin level <30 μg/L), oral iron is often insufficient or has a too slow effect and thus intravenous iron, safe also during pregnancy, may be needed. In addition, folate supplementation is favorable for RLS and it is also advisable during the periconception and early pregnancy period for fetal development. In addition, the use of magnesium may be beneficial, although the efficacy data is insufficient. Furthermore, relaxation procedures, walking, stretching, massage, use of compression stockings while sleeping or a warm bath before going to bed may also relieve the symptoms. In severe cases, pramipexole, levodopamin/carbidopamin, opioids, bensodiazepins or gabapentin beyond the first trimester may be needed under a consultation of a neurologist, with the lowest efficient dose, although all these medications may induce risks and side-effects for fetus and new-born.2, 5 Although sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, the sleep quality is not systematically assessed during pregnancy follow-ups. Furthermore, the research evaluating the reasons and consequences of maternal sleep disturbances and the safety and efficacy of the treatments are scant. Good sleep quality is, nevertheless, essential for good quality of life and good health state and thus additional research in the field is indispensable.",

There are two fundamental aspects of life that are all too often ignored but have more recently received attention in high-performance sport – sleep and circadian biology. The impact of sleep on cognitive function and mood state could impact the ability to seamlessly coordinate all of the elements included in a skating performance and also increase the risk of injury. One way to counter the adverse effects of sleep restriction is to get additional sleep – either through sleep extension or by adding naps during the day. There is evidence that the symptoms of jet lag can have a negative impact on mental and physical performance. Adjusting meals to the corresponding time in the destination time zone can possibly help shift the digestive circadian rhythm and appetite-regulating hormones.",

      "abstract": "The circadian rhythm of arterial pressure (AP) is not a passive consequence of the impact of exogenous factors. Endogenous mechanisms play an important role in the generation and maintenance of AP rhythm. The adaptation of the exogenous components of AP rhythm to the demands of the environment is modulated by the circadian-time-dependent responsiveness of the biologic oscillator. A neuronal network in the rostral hypothalamus including the suprachiasmatic nucleus is implicated in the generation of AP rhythm, in the modification of the rhythm amplitude (possibly due to homeostatic constraints), and in the regulation of its phase. The central sympathoexcitatory pathway to the upper thoracic cord plays a crucial role in the maintenance of normal circadian AP rhythm. The circadian pattern of AP is influenced also by hormonal factors such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axes, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, opioids, and various vasoactive peptides. The circadian variations of AP depend on physiological state--sleep and wakefulness, pregnancy, work, and senescence (primary aging). In some essential hypertensive patients and in patients with secondary hypertension the nocturnal fall in AP is reduced or absent (nondippers). Target-organ damage is more advanced in nondippers than in dippers. The occurrence of cardiovascular events exhibits a prominent circadian pattern, with events more frequent in the morning (06:00-12:00 h).",

Sleep disturbances influence many behavioral and physiologic processes, leading to health complications including death. On the other hand, sleep improvement can beneficially influence the course of healing of many disorders and can be a prognostic of health recovery. The factors influencing sleep have different biological and chemical origins. They are classical hormones, hypothalamic releasing and inhibitory hormones, neuropeptides, peptides and others as cytokines, prostaglandins, oleamid, adenosine, nitric oxide. These factors regulate most physiologic processes and are likely elements integrating sleep with physiology and physiology with sleep in health and disorders.",

      "title": "Dysautonomias: Clinical Disorders of the Autonomic Nervous System",
      "abstract": "The term dysautonomia refers to a change in autonomic nervous system function that adversely affects health. The changes range from transient, occasional episodes of neurally mediated hypotension to progressive neurodegenerative diseases; from disorders in which altered autonomic function plays a primary pathophysiologic role to disorders in which it worsens an independent pathologic state; and from mechanistically straightforward to mysterious and controversial entities. In chronic autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson disease), orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure from sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after “patchy” autonomic impairment or blood volume depletion or, as highlighted in this discussion, from a primary abnormality that augments delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart. Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys seems to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm that is associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, which rationalizes treatment with β-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between the chronic fatigue syndrome and orthostatic intolerance; however, treatment with the salt-retaining steroid fludrocortisone, which is usually beneficial in primary chronic autonomic failure, does not seem to be beneficial in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Dysautonomias are an important subject in clinical neurocardiology.",

      "abstract": "Sleep consists of two phases that periodically alternate: the rapid eye movement (REM) phase and the non-REM phase. The non-REM stage is characterized by wide synchronous waves in the electroencephalogram, by a low heart rate and by a decrease in arterial blood pressure and peripheral resistances. This hemodynamic setting is the consequence of the autonomic balance characterized by high vagal activity and low sympathetic activity. Such an autonomic condition is adequately described by the spectral analysis of heart rate variability documenting a prevalence in the high frequency band (the respiratory vagal band). The REM stage of sleep is characterized by asynchronous waves in the electroencephalogram and it is associated with a further increase in the vagal dominance of the autonomic balance resulting in a lower heart rate and decreased peripheral resistances. The REM phase of sleep is, however, also characterized by hemodynamic instability due to sudden bursts of sympathetic activity, associated with the rapid eye movements. These sympathetic bursts cause sudden changes in heart rate and peripheral resistance and may influence cardiac electrical stability both at the atrial and ventricular levels. Additionally, REM sleep may enhance the risk of anginal attacks in coronary artery disease patients. Analysis of the autonomic balance during the different phases of sleep may also help in the identification of autonomic derangements typically associated with myocardial infarction.",

Its wide presence in the phylogenetic vertebrate scale and even in human fetuses as young as 12 weeks directed the search for the common anatomic and biochemical mechanisms involved. The demonstration that yawning is not connected with high CO2 or low O2 blood levels left aside a prevalent metabolic hypothesis. Its close relationship with the sleep-wake cycle, specially in moments previous to falling asleep and after awaking has been related to changes in personal situation and activity. A single component of this reflex which is to be found exclusively in humans, is the fact that yawning is contagious. Thus, it is considered a component of the adaptative mechanism that is part of the surveillance reflex, becoming a significant paralinguistic evolutive expression aimed at protection and social cohesion. The common anatomical structures and neurochemical systems taking part in yawning, the sleep-wake cycle and the temporal lobe epilepsy may imply that yawning results from a set of protective systems induced by endogenous opiods which intervene in the inhibition and prevention of the temporal lobe epileptic seizures.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

Nächtliche generalisierte tonisch-klonische Anfälle, aber auch multiple fokal-komplexe Anfälle führen zu einer Störung der Schlafarchitektur sowie zu einer vermehrten Tagesmüdigkeit. Zudem ist kein REM-Rebound in den nachfolgenden Nächten zu beobachten. Unabhängig von den Anfällen führt der chronische epileptische Zustand – insbesondere bei Patienten mit fokalen Epilepsien – zu Störungen der Schlafarchitektur. Epilepsiepatienten leiden im Vergleich zur Allgemeinbevölkerung an einer 2- bis 3-fach erhöhten Prävalenz von subjektiv empfundenen Schlafstörungen. Schlafstörungen sind zudem mit einer signifikanten Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität assoziiert. Auch Kinder mit Epilepsie leiden häufiger an Schlafstörungen als gesunde Kinder, wobei eine schlechte Schlafqualität wiederum zu Verhaltensproblemen und einer schlechteren Lebensqualität führt. Eine vermehrte Tagesmüdigkeit stellt mit einer Prävalenz von 30–50% die häufigste schlafbezogene Störung bei Epilepsiepatienten dar und konnte auch mit objektiven Tests nachgewiesen werden. Obstruktive Schlaf-Apnoen (OSA) treten bei Epilepsiepatienten mit einer Prävalenz von 10–33% signifikant häufiger auf als in der Allgemeinbevölkerung. Als mögliche Mechanismen sind die Effekte von zentral dämpfenden Antiepileptika, eine durch Antiepileptika verursachte Gewichtszunahme und das gehäufte Vorliegen eines polyzystischen Ovar-Syndroms bei Frauen mit Epilepsie anzuführen. Eine OSA kann mit einer Exazerbation von Anfällen einhergehen. Umgekehrt kann die erfolgreiche Behandlung einer OSA zu einer Verbesserung der Anfallskontrolle führen.",

There may be a feeling of having been awake all night even when getting some sleep.\n\nPeople with comorbid disorders of physical or mental health, such as depression, have higher rates of insomnia. Depression and sleep disturbance are the first and third most common psychological reasons for patient encounters in general practice.4 Untreated, insomnia increases the risk of development or exacerbation of anxiety, depression, hypertension, and diabetes.5 6 This article outlines current concepts in insomnia and provides up to date information on treatment.\n\nMost people will experience sleep disturbance or acute insomnia at some point in any given year. This often occurs around predictable times of stress or when sleep patterns are disrupted, such as with travel, busy periods at work, illness, or emotional upset. While people may be distressed about sleep loss during acute insomnia, once the trigger factors are removed, sleep usually returns to normal.\n\nInsomnia becomes chronic when someone has difficulty either getting to sleep or staying asleep for at least three nights a week (not necessarily every night) for at least three months and is distressed by their sleep symptoms. …",

      "title": "Exploring the relationship between seasonal changes and bipolar disorder relapses",
      "abstract": "Introduction Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mental health disorder characterized by episodes of mania or hypomania alternating with depression, and it is known that seasonal changes can have an impact on the risk of relapse. Circadian rhythm - which works as an internal biological clock that regulates sleep-wake cycles, hormone production and mood stability -, plays a crucial role in the course of the disease, and it is likely that it influences relapse during seasonal changes, through mechanisms not entirely understood. Objectives Review the relationship between seasonal changes and bipolar disorder relapse, focusing on circadian rhythm disruption, including possible pathophysiological pathways and treatment options. Methods Narrative review of articles published on Pubmed’s database using the following keywords and their combinations: bipolar disorder , circadian rhythms , seasonal and sleep disturbances , screening for relevance. Results Several studies show us that manic episodes are associated with transition into spring and summer and depressive ones with transition into autumn and winter. Seasonal changes result in alterations in daylight exposure, which in turn, through the cardinal role of the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus, lead to disruptions in sleep-wake cycles, impacting melatonin and cortisol levels, which can contribute to mood instability. These hormones are also subjected to changes by other shifts in biological rhythms such as body temperature regulation, that come with seasonal transitions. On the other hand, light exposure also influences neurotransmission, particularly of serotonin and dopamine, with consequences on energy, mood and reward processing and arousal. There might also be a role for genetic polymorphisms like CLOCK, BMAL1 and PER, that influence sleep patterns and hormonal regulation, and therefore can predispose some people to mood disorders. Furthermore, there are important social factors related to seasonal changes, such as increases or decreases in social activities, that can impact mood. Therapeutic approaches that target circadian rhythm, such as light therapy and chronotherapy (including options like sleep deprivation and phase advance therapies), can be useful in decreasing relapse episodes. Additionally, simple psychoeducation on the matter, regarding maintenance of regular sleep schedules and social activities, might be helpful in preventing or, at the very least, decreasing relapses. Conclusions Seasonal changes play a relevant role in both manic and depressive relapses in BD through their role in circadian rhythm disruption, by way of a myriad of mechanisms. Future investigation should focus on these mechanisms and others that might possibly be involved, allowing us to reach more targeted treatment and even preventative measures to diminish relapse episodes in BD.

      "abstract": "Il sonno copre circa un terzo del tempo totale della vita di ognuno. In questi ultimi anni e notevolmente aumentato l’interesse, sia a livello clinico che di ricerca, riguardo al sonno e alle patologie e ai disturbi ad esso correlati. In particolare, numerose ricerche dimostrano che la qualita del sonno ha un fortissimo impatto sulla qualita della vita e un sonno “disturbato” costituisce un fattore di rischio per numerose patologie. Quindi l’interesse e rivolto non solo a monitorare l’insorgere di patologie del sonno (quali apnee notturne, insonnia, ecc, ) ma anche insufficienza cardiaca, e patologie psichiatriche, quali i disturbi bipolari, sui quali la qualita’ del sonno ha un forte impatto e conseguenze a livello clinico. Il sonno inoltre e una condizione che consente il monitoraggio in modo continuativo in condizioni con elevato grado di ripetibilita, in quanto numerosi fattori esterni e non controllabili presenti durante il giorno, non sono presenti durante il periodo di sonno. Tutto questo giustifica la nascita di numerosi sensori e dispositivi per il monitoraggio domiciliare del sonno, in alternativa alla polisonnografia utilizzata invece a livello clinico e all’interno di specifici reparti ospedalieri. In questo lavoro di tesi vengono presi in considerazione due tipologie di sensori: una maglietta sensorizzata che permette di acquisire ECG, respiro e movimenti mediante un accelerometro triassiale, ed un materasso sensorizzato che registra il ballistocardiogramma (BCG) da cui si ottengono: serie RR (cioe le durate dei singoli cicli cardiaci, i movimenti respiratorio e i movimenti corporei. Lo scopo dello studio e creare un sistema che, a partire dai segnali registrati, possa fornire informazioni sulla qualita del sonno e riesca ad identificare ed a quantificare la presenza di alcuni eventi che possono verificarsi durante il periodo di sonno e sono correlabili alla presenza di patologie. La parte principale dello studio e rivolta alla validazione dei dispositivi utilizzati e allo sviluppo di metodologie specifiche di analisi e classificazione dei segnali, al fine di consentire una valutazione automatica delle registrazioni. In particolare, sono stati sviluppati metodi per la classificazione degli stadi del sonno, l’identificazione di eventi cardiovascolari e respiratori, la classificazione degli stati emotivi (con particolare riferimento al disordine bipolare). I metodi sviluppati sono stati validati su casistiche di soggetti di controllo e su soggetti patologici e hanno dimostrato l’efficacia delle metodiche implementate. Nuovi parametri verranno introdotti e testati e le procedure verranno rese completamente automatiche al fine di facilitare l’utilizza domiciliare da parte di utilizzatori che non abbiamo una specifica preparazione.",

In addition to changes in sleep duration and quality, sleep architecture also changes as age progresses. Age by itself does not result in sleep disorders; rather, these changes are associated with psychosocial and health factors in the elderly such as the existence of multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, and age-related changes in circadian rhythm. Older adults have increased prevalence of various primary sleep disorders, including restless leg syndrome, insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, circadian rhythm disturbances and periodic limb syndrome. Challenges in identifying, diagnosing, and treating sleep disorders in older adults with dementia also exist, which further complicates the management of sleep disorders in these patients. Poor sleep not only impacts the quality of life and cognitive functioning but is also associated with increased morbidity and mortality and thus requires careful screening and assessment in the elderly population.&lt;br&gt;",

Because they represent conflict between the timing of the patient's endogenous rhythms and desired timing of sleep, the presenting complaints may include both difficulty of sleep initiation or maintenance and undesired or unplanned daytime or early evening sleepiness. Therefore, circadian disorders may be misdiagnosed as either a primary insomnia or a hypersomnia disorder, depending on which complaint is more troublesome for the patient. Objective information about sleep and wake patterns over long periods is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Actigraphy provides long-term information about the rest/activity pattern about an individual. However, caution should be applied in interpretation of the results because the information provided only includes information of movements, and activity is only an indirect circadian phase marker. Timing of light and melatonin therapy is critical for successful treatment of circadian rhythm disorders. Therefore, results of actigraphy are useful and should be used in conjunction with additional measurements, including 24 hours sleep-wake history, sleep log, and melatonin measurements.",

Um declinio da funcao relacionado a idade pode ser demonstrado em todas as partes desses sistemas, tendo como resultado o fato de que um terco da populacao acima de 65 anos sofre quedas a cada ano. Objetivo: Avaliar a relacao da velocidade da marcha e do equilibrio estatico no risco de queda em idosos sedentarios. Metodologia: Trata-se de um estudo de carater transversal, observacional e de campo, com abordagem quantitativa. A amostra foi por conveniencia, e teve sua coleta realizada no periodo de seis meses a partir da aprovacao pelo Comite de Etica em Pesquisa (CEP), composta por idosos, com idade compreendida entre 60 e 80 anos, que estiveram de acordo com a realizacao da pesquisa e assinaram o Termo de Consentimento Livre e Esclarecido (TCLE). Os individuos inseridos no estudo foram submetidos a avaliacao da escala BERG, bem como fizeram o teste de velocidade da marcha (TVM) e do risco de quedas e fragilidade, atraves do teste Time Up and Go (TUG). Os dados coletados foram tabulados em uma planilha do Microsoft Excel® Office 2016 e, posteriormente, analisados atraves de frequencia absoluta e relativa e apresentados sob a forma de tabelas e figuras, sendo considerados como significância estatistica aqueles que apresentaram p < 0,05. Resultados: A associacao entre TUG e TVM mostrou que quanto maior o risco de queda, mais lenta e a marcha apresentada pelo paciente. Quando associado TUG e BERG, notou-se que quanto maior o deficit de equilibrio, maior o risco de queda. Atraves da associacao entre BERG e TVM, observou-se que quanto maior o deficit de equilibrio, menor sera a velocidade da marcha manifestada. Conclusao: As correlacoes entre os testes se fazem coerentes, mostrando que quanto maior o deficit de equilibrio, menor sera a velocidade da marcha apresentada no grupo feminino e, consequentemente, maior o risco de queda.",

      "title": "Does the Patient Have Excessive Daytime Sleepiness?",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is defined as difficulty staying awake during the usual waking hours. The prevalence of EDS is estimated to be 18–20% in the United States. EDS may occur as a result of numerous conditions, including insufficient sleep or other central disorders of hypersomnolence, sleep-related breathing disorders, medications or substances, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, psychiatric or neurological disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, pregnancy, and various metabolic disorders and medical conditions. True sleepiness is the propensity to fall asleep and is not synonymous with fatigue or always associated with decreased vigilance. Excessive self-reported subjective sleepiness on validated scales such as the ESS may be useful for suggesting the presence of a possible sleep disorder requiring evaluation. However, patients may misinterpret fatigue associated with medical and psychiatric conditions as sleepiness or have an inaccurate perception of the degree of their sleepiness. Objective tests of sleepiness may be helpful to determine whether an abnormal propensity to fall asleep is present. The assessment and diagnosis of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is usually made based on a combination of sleep history, past medical, psychiatric, surgical, and family history, a physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests.",

      "title": "UNEXPECTED AUTOPSY FINDINGS IN UNEXPECTED DEATHS.",
      "abstract": "Death is usually anticipated. Physiological death resulting from senility and the gradual wearing out of organs and tissues is probably an exceptional occurrence. The end usually comes as a culmination of some disease of whose ravages the clinician and the patient are aware. Sometimes it comes with suddenness as the result of an accident, of the imbibition of a poison, or of a sudden turn for the worse in an already existing disease, and sometimes it comes for no apparent reason. It is the unexpected cases of death to which reference is made in this paper. When one hears of an unexpected death, one's mind usually turns to two, or at most three, of the systems of the body. One thinks first perhaps of the circulatory system, and secondarily of the nervous and respiratory systems, and as a matter of fact, the majority of cases of unexpected death may be referred to one of these. But in the course of autopsy experience one learns that there is a wide range, in lesions of these systems, and that the primary cause of the demise may occasionally originate in other systems and tissues, although the actual termination of life may be due to the effect upon one of the three systems previously mentioned. The cases reported have, with a few exceptions been selected from a series of about 1200 autopsies performed at the Hamilton General Hospital during the past ten years. Many of the more unusual observations have been revealed in autopsies done on cases, which have been the subjects of coroner's investigations, and where little or no previous clinical history was available. No doubt some of the so-called unexpected findings",

      "abstract": "AbstractIt is still debated whether the deterioration of the sleep pattern, frequently reported by elderly subjects, is due only to aging per se. Other factors associated with aging or modifications of biological rhythms could also be involved. Elderly subjects frequently complain of daytime sleepiness, but it is not clear whether this actually represents a return to a polyphasic structure of sleep, or only a consequence of a disturbed night sleep. Ten healthy, independent and active elderly subjects (age > 72 years) were evaluated by means of 24-hour ambulatory polysomnography. Findings of nocturnal sleep were compared with sleep of the same group in the. 24-hour period and with sleep of young healthy controls. We observed a fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, but a fairly good representation of stages and a preservation of cyclicity. Except for three cases, with early or late times of sleep onset and wake-up, sleep disruption did not seem to be related to modification of circadian rhythms. Only three subjects presented undesired daytime naps, whereas the others either did not show daytime sleep at all, or were used to having their siesta after lunch since their young adulthood. In normal aging, daytime sleep does not constitute a social problem. Ambulatory polysomnography is a valid alternative to laboratory recordings in the identification of daytime sleep.Key Words: Sleepambulatory polysomnographynormal aging",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is deﬁned as difﬁculty with the initiation, maintenance, duration, or quality of sleep resulting in the impairment of daytime functioning despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep (1,2). Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

Hypersomnia may be caused by an underlying medical or neurological disease. Secondary hypersomnias described in the chapter include Parkinson's disease, genetic disorders, endocrine disorders and psychiatric disorders. Multiple chemical substances, especially organic solvents with chronic exposure, may cause hypersomnia. Pancreatic, adrenal or renal insufficiency, and hepatic encephalopathy are other causes. Hypersomnia may occur as a side effect of many drugs, due either to the soporific effects of the drug or to the effect of the drug on reducing night-time sleep.",

Los pacientes con este trastorno son a menudo añosos y en general presentan otras comorbilidades. Los pacientes a menudo buscan atención médica con síntomas de aturdimiento, pre-síncope, síncope y, en pacientes con periodos alternantes de bradicardia y taquicardia, palpitaciones u otros síntomas asociados con una frecuencia cardíaca rápida. Debido a que los síntomas pueden ser de naturaleza variable, inespecíficos y frecuentemente transitorios, a veces puede ser difícil establecer esta relación síntoma-alteración electrocardiográfica. Los hallazgos electrocardiográficos típicos son uno o más episodios de bradicardia sinusal extrema (Rubenstein Tipo I), o pausas sinusales, paro y bloqueo de salida sinoatrial (Rubenstein Tipo II), o episodios de bradicardia y/o pausas alternantes con taquiarritmias auriculares (Rubenstein Tipo III). Las investigaciones basadas en el registro de electrogramas locales auriculares anormalmente prolongados y fraccionados durante el ritmo sinusal y su distribución característica en la aurícula derecha de pacientes con DNS han aportado un conocimiento importante sobre las propiedades electrofisiológicas de la aurícula patológica. El electrograma auricular anormal traduce una conducción auricular irregular, caracterizada por una actividad eléctrica local no homogénea, relacionada con una conducción anisotrópica, no uniforme y retardada a través de un miocardio auricular patológico, en el que se pueden originar arritmias por reentrada. La detección de electrogramas auriculares anormales en la DNS identifica a un grupo de pacientes con vulnerabilidad auricular aumentada y con una incidencia significativamente mayor de episodios espontáneos o inducidos de fibrilación auricular.",

In these sleep disorders, the pattern of sleep-wake is misaligned with the patient's circadian system or the external environment, resulting in insomnia. Appropriately-timed exposure to bright light can shift the sleep-wake cycle to earlier or later times, in order to correct for misalignment between the circadian system and the desired sleep-wake schedule. Evidence of the efficacy of bright light was so limited. Further research is needed to determine guidelines for the appropriate timing and safe use of bright light therapy.",

      "abstract": "Maintenance of optimal health in humans requires the proper balance between exercise, rest, and sleep as well as time in the upright position. About one-third of a lifetime is spent sleeping; and it is no coincidence that sleeping is performed in the horizontal position, the position in which gravitational influence on the body is minimal. Although enforced bed rest is necessary for the treatment of some ailments, in some cases it has probably been used unwisely. In addition to the lower hydrostatic pressure with the normally dependent regions of the cardiovascular system, body fuid compartments during bed rest in the horizontal body position, and virtual elimination of compression on the long bones of the skeletal system during bed rest (hypogravia), there is often reduction in energy metabolism due to the relative confinement (hypodynamia) and alteration of ambulatory circadian variations in metabolism, body temperature, and many hormonal systems. If patients are also moved to unfamiliar surroundings, they probably experience some feelings of anxiety and some sociopsychological problems. Adaptive physiological responses during bed rest are normal for that environment. They are attempts by the body to reduce unnecessary energy expenditure, to optimize its function, and to enhance its survival potential. Many of the deconditioning responses begin within the first day or two of bed rest; these early responses have prompted physicians to insist upon early resumption of the upright posture and ambulation of bedridden patients.",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

Research shows that most people with mental disorders such as anxiety also have some kind of sleep disorder. Hypomania is an abnormal state of mind that affects your mood, thoughts, and behavior and is a potential symptom of bipolar disorder, especially type II. A hypomanic episode is usually characterized by unusual happiness, flashy excitement, or agitation, along with other features such as inflated self-esteem, excessive talkativeness, increased distractibility, decreased need for sleep, and racing thoughts.",

It has been recommended that adults, aged 18 –64 years, should sleep for 7 to 9 hours per night, however, many people struggle with sleep problems of various kinds and hardly meet these recommendations. Sleep is necessary for cognition, alertness, vigilance, and sustenance of attention as well as control of emotions. The effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance and other psychological variables have been widely studied. Sleepiness, the short-term effect of inadequate sleep, may lead to irritability, reduced alertness, poor motor skills, and attention problems. Among the long-term effects are obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and mental health disorders. Sleep deprivation in adults of all ages is defined as getting less than 7 hours of sleep per night.",

Sleep function is closely related to the Sleep Cycle, containing two main parts: rapid eye movement (REM), which is also named active sleep; and no rapid eye movement (NREM), which is defined as deep sleep. The first REM period may be less than 10 minutes in duration, while the last one may exceed 60 minutes. Awakening after a full night’s sleep is usually from REM sleep. The sleep pattern changes as the child grows. Polycyclic sleep pattern of the newborn changes to a monocyclic adult pattern. In newborns, the total sleep duration can be 14 to 16 hours, in a day of 24 hours. According to the Cleveland Clinic, lack of sleep can result in short – term and long – term problems. Short – term problems include lack of alertness, excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired memory and stress, whereas longitude lack of sleep can result in high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure or stroke.",

It is recognized as feelings of being worn-out, tired, lethargic, and irritable, with fuzzy thinking and difficulty in getting going. When it occurs, it tends to last for an average of 4.4 hr. This syndrome is particularly marked following sleep of 10 or more hr when the individual is not making up a sleep deficit. Under these conditions, the worn-out syndrome is more typical than feeling just great. These data suggest the testable hypothesis that optimal durations of sleep fall into a relatively narrow band and that disruptive psycho-physiological effects are sustained with both too much and too little sleep.",

      "abstract": "Shift work schedules, intensive physical exercise late in the day, psychological stress, or a busy lifestyle might induce disorders of the circadian structure, which can affect health on both the physiological and neurobehavioral levels. Rest-activity rhythm is strongly connected with an organism's circadian structure, and irregular sleep-wake patterns can lead to a disruption of entrainment, resulting in physiological and neurobehavioral dysfunction. Shift nurses are often subject to disturbances in the quality and duration of their sleep, raising the possibility of negative impacts on their health and their patients' safety. Researchers have used actigraphy in a number of studies to assess sleep patterns. Because of the close connection between sleep and circadian structure, it may be useful to extend the evaluation of actigraphy data to the analysis of the rest-activity rhythm with rhythmometric procedures to provide a better understanding of possible sleep disorders in relation to entrainment. Actigraphy is an easy and reliable way to study these rhythms and identify possible circadian-rhythm disorders. In this article, the authors discuss methodological issues concerning the evaluation of the rest-activity rhythm, with a focus on actigraphy.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital physiological and psychological process essential for overall health and well-being, yet it is often severely disrupted in areas affected by armed conflict and disasters. In these environments, civilians frequently become internally displaced or refugees, experiencing fragmented or reduced sleep due to factors such as constant noise from drones and airstrikes, overcrowded shelters, and pervasive fear for personal safety. These sleep disturbances, including but not limited to insomnia and nightmares, are not merely secondary effects of a conflict or disaster but can also exacerbate stress responses, weaken immune function, and increase the risk of psychological toll and manifestations such as anxiety and depression. Public health initiatives increasingly recognize sleep disruption as both a predictor and consequence of trauma, highlighting the need for targeted interventions. However, the implementation of such interventions is often hindered by resource constraints in conflict and disaster zones. Elevated cortisol levels and inflammatory cytokines have been linked to prolonged sleep loss, which can further intensify stress responses and increase susceptibility to infections. Addressing sleep disturbances is crucial for improving overall health outcomes for the affected population and facilitating recovery and reintegration as crises subside. Integrating sleep-focused strategies into humanitarian and public health responses is essential for mitigating the long-term psychological and physical impacts of conflict and disaster, ultimately supporting the restoration of healthier and more stable communities.",

This review discusses the physiology of sleep, including its two independent states, rapid eye movement (REM) and non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as well as functional neuroanatomy, physiologic changes during sleep, and circadian rhythms. The classification and diagnosis of sleep disorders are discussed generally. The diagnosis and treatment of the following disorders are described: obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy-cataplexy sydrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements in sleep, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, insomnias, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and parasomnias. Sleep-related movement disorders and the relationship between sleep and psychiatric disorders are also discussed. Tables describe behavioral and physiologic characteristics of states of awareness, the international classification of sleep disorders, common sleep complaints, comorbid insomnia disorders, causes of excessive daytime somnolence, laboratory tests to assess sleep disorders, essential diagnostic criteria for RLS and Willis-Ekbom disease, and drug therapy for insomnia. Figures include polysomnographic recording showing wakefulness in an adult; stage 1, 2, and 3 NREM sleep in an adult; REM sleep in an adult; a patient with sleep apnea syndrome; a patient with Cheyne-Stokes breathing; a patient with RLS; and a patient with dream-enacting behavior; schematic sagittal section of the brainstem of the cat; schematic diagram of the McCarley-Hobson model of REM sleep mechanism; the Lu-Saper “flip-flop” model; the Luppi model to explain REM sleep mechanism; and a wrist actigraph from a man with bipolar disorder.

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

In case of some epileptic syndromes seizures occur predominantly or solely in sleep. Epilepsy can modify normal sleep patterns; on the other hand, sleep influences interictal epileptiform discharges, increasing their number and changing their morphology and spreading depending on sleep stage. Although interictal discharges in focal epilepsy are more common in sleep than in wakefulness, discharge distribution in generalized epilepsy is more variable. For some epileptic syndromes there is a strong correlation between time of onset, frequency, severity of attacks and stage of sleep cycle or wakefulness. Further research in this area can shed light not only on mechanisms of epileptic networks functioning, but also on the sleep-wake cycle regulatory systems.",

However, higher levels of deep sleep and/or lower levels of light sleep have been reported in several all-night polysomnography studies in CFS patients. This distribution of Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (NREMS) contrasts with what would be expected if sleep was interrupted by microawakenings, such as in sleep apneas or periodic limb movements, where more light sleep and less deep sleep are commonly observed. This \"paradoxical\" distribution of NREMS could represent a characteristic feature of chronic fatigue and deserved to be investigated.Methods: A retrospective comparison of the NREMS distribution was performed between 28 \"pure\" Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients (without primary sleep or psychiatric disorders), 27 Apneic-Hypopneic patients and 27 Healthy Controls.Results: Data showed CFS patients to have a higher stage 4/stage 2 or stage 4/light sleep ratios than the other two conditions.Conclusion: This sleep pattern is closer to what is observed in cases of infections than to what is seen after sleep fragmentation by primary sleep or in psychiatric disorders. Such a particular sleep pattern could provide insights into the pathophysiology of fatigue.",

      "title": "Practical Recommendations for Hypnotic Switching in Insomnia Management: A Canadian Expert Clinical Framework",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a complex condition in which patients experience difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening. Chronic insomnia is defined as dissatisfying sleep quality or quantity, occurring at least three times per week, that has persisted for at least three months. Insomnia is common, with a higher incidence in certain subpopulations, including older adults (≥65 years of age) and patients with psychiatric and physical comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and alcohol or substance use disorders. Individuals experiencing insomnia often have disrupted sleep architecture, with polysomnography showing reduced time spent in the rejuvenating slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. As such, insomnia can seriously impair daytime functioning, cognition, and quality of life. Further, insomnia may result in a higher risk of various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, though the association between insomnia and these comorbidities is likely bi-directional. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the diagnosis is often missed or trivialized in medical practice. Given the profound impact of chronic insomnia, a proactive diagnosis and successful treatment is essential. The primary non-pharmacologic treatment option available for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on sleep hygiene techniques, sleep restriction, circadian rhythm therapy, and cognitive therapy. Although CBT-I is the first-line treatment for insomnia and should always be recommended, it may not always be available in a timely manner, it can be costly and not every patient can afford it, some patients choose to opt out, and may not be sufficient as a single therapy approach. Thus, in many cases, pharmacotherapy may be needed in addition to or instead of CBT-I to treat insomnia and improve daytime functioning and associated cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Of note, patients also often self-medicate with over-the-counter medications, including cannabis products. Currently, commonly prescribed medications for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs; e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam) and Z-drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone).10 In addition, despite their risks, antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have also been used to treat insomnia despite being off-label and promoting sleep indirectly.",

This chapter begins by synthesizing existing research regarding the normative changes in sleep architecture, timing, and duration which occur from middle age to late-life. These normative changes are characterized by less N3 sleep, earlier bed and wake times, and shorter overall nocturnal sleep duration. The chapter concludes by providing an overview of common sleep disorders in older adulthood, including circadian rhythm disorder, sleep disordered breathing, and insomnia. These sleep disorders become more prevalent with age and are frequently associated with declines in functioning. Overall, though changes in sleep in late-life are common, they tend to occur gradually, with a significant portion of older adults able to maintain adequate sleep as they age.",

      "abstract": "Biological functions occur at many different frequencies, and each has its healthy and pathological ranges, patterns, and properties. Physiology, biochemistry, and behavior are not only organized at the morphological level in cells and organs, but separated or coordinated in time for minimal interference and optimal function. One of the most important temporal frameworks is that of the 24-hour day-night cycle, and its change in day length with season. Robust circadian rhythms are important for mental and physical well-being. Though rhythms have been long neglected as irrelevant (in spite of the high prevalence of sleep disorders in nearly every psychiatric illness), we now have tools to document rhythm disruption and, through better understanding of underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms, to develop therapeutic applications. Light as the major synchronizing agent of the biological clock is becoming a treatment option not only for winter depression but other, nonseasonal forms, as well as an adjunct in optimizing sleep-wake cycles, daytime alertness, cognition, and mood in many neuropsychiatric illnesses. Melatonin is the signal of darkness and promotes sleep onset. Manipulation of sleep (wake therapy, phase advance) has yielded the most rapid, nonpharmacological antidepressant effect known, and combinations (with light, medication) provide long-lasting response. Thus, by analogy, new molecules to augment synchronization or mimic changes occuring during night-time wakefulness may yield novel treatments. This issue on biological rhythms contains articles on a variety of different frequencies not included in the usual definition of chronobiology, but which open up interesting approaches to time and illness.",

      "title": "Sleep and circadian difficulties in schizophrenia: presentations, understanding, and treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is common in mental health care to ask about people’s days but comparatively rare to ask about their nights. Most patients diagnosed with schizophrenia struggle at nighttime. The next-day effects can include a worsening of psychotic experiences, affective disturbances, and inactivity, which in turn affect the next night’s sleep. Objective and subjective cognitive abilities may be affected too. Patients commonly experience a mix of sleep difficulties in a night and across a week. These difficulties include trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping at all; nightmares and other awakenings; poor-quality sleep; oversleeping; tiredness; sleeping at the wrong times; and problems establishing a regular sleep pattern. The patient group is also more vulnerable to obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. We describe in this article how the complex presentation of non-respiratory sleep difficulties arises from variation across five factors: timing, mental state, need for sleep, self-care, and environment. We set out 10 illustrative patterns of such difficulties experienced by patients with non-affective psychosis. These sleep problems are eminently treatable with intensive psychological therapy delivered over approximately eight sessions. We describe key techniques and their typical order of implementation by presentation. Sleep problems are an important issue for patients. Giving them the therapeutic attention patients often desire brings both real clinical benefits and improves views of services. Treatment is also very likely to lessen psychotic experiences and mood disturbances while improving daytime functioning and quality of life. Tackling sleep difficulties can be a route toward the successful treatment of psychosis.",

      "title": "Sleep and Quality of Life in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD) are both widespread and wide-ranging. Emerging early in the disease process, sometimes prior to the onset of motor symptoms, sleep disruption results from the degeneration of the basal ganglia that is the hallmark of the disease, as well as changes in brain stem sleep centres. Accordingly, sleep problems consist of motor symptoms such as stiffness, difficulty turning and dystonia as well as disruption to the normal sleep–wake cycle, arousal and alertness. Sleep disruption has been associated with reduced quality of life (QOL) and increased depression and anxiety in PD patients and their caregivers alike, and may be severe enough to impair everyday functioning. It is also likely that presence of certain sleep symptoms such as REM behaviour disorder (RBD) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are the harbingers of a poor prognosis. Although no studies have yet investigated the effect of sleep problems on institutionalization in PD, chronic disruption to the sleep of caregivers may well lead to a breakdown in the caregiving relationship and care arrangements. The following article reviews the prevalence, phenomenology, pathophysiology and impact of sleep disturbances on QOL for individuals with PD and their caregivers. Clinical management strategies are discussed.",

      "title": "Autonomic Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) results not only in motor and sensory deficits but also in autonomic dysfunctions. The disruption of connections between higher brain centers and the spinal cord, or the impaired autonomic nervous system itself, manifests a broad range of autonomic abnormalities. This includes compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, thermoregulatory, and sexual activities. These disabilities evoke potentially life-threatening symptoms that severely interfere with the daily living of those with SCI. In particular, high thoracic or cervical SCI often causes disordered hemodynamics due to deregulated sympathetic outflow. Episodic hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia develops as a result of massive sympathetic discharge often triggered by unpleasant visceral or sensory stimuli below the injury level. In the pelvic floor, bladder and urethral dysfunctions are classified according to upper motor neuron versus lower motor neuron injuries; this is dependent on the level of lesion. Most impairments of the lower urinary tract manifest in two interrelated complications: bladder storage and emptying. Inadequate or excessive detrusor and sphincter functions as well as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia are examples of micturition abnormalities stemming from SCI. Gastrointestinal motility disorders in spinal cord injured-individuals are comprised of gastric dilation, delayed gastric emptying, and diminished propulsive transit along the entire gastrointestinal tract. As a critical consequence of SCI, neurogenic bowel dysfunction exhibits constipation and/or incontinence. Thus, it is essential to recognize neural mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying various complications of autonomic dysfunctions after SCI. This overview provides both vital information for better understanding these disorders and guides to pursue novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate secondary complications. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, characterized by spontaneous and recurring unprovoked seizures, affecting approximately at least 2% of the global population. Epileptogenesis involves complex and dynamic changes at the molecular, cellular, and network levels within the brain. A critical aspect of this process is the reorganization of neuronal networks, which plays an essential role in the development and perpetuation of epileptic activity. This reorganization includes alterations in synaptic connectivity, neurogenesis, and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. The relationship between sleep and epilepsy is complex and bidirectional. Sleep can influence seizure occurrence and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), and conversely, epilepsy and seizures can impact sleep architecture and quality. Insomnia in children with epilepsy is a complex and multifactorial condition involving intricate interactions between neurophysiological, genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. Understanding the pathophysiology of insomnia in this population requires a comprehensive approach considering the diverse mechanisms contributing to sleep disruption.",

      "abstract": "Le trouble bipolaire (TB) est une maladie psychiatrique multifactorielle à hérédité complexe faisant intervenir des facteurs de risque génétiques et environnementaux [1]. Parmi ces facteurs de risque, des anomalies des rythmes circadiens et du sommeil ont été mises en évidence dans les TB et témoignent de l’implication d’anomalies de l’horloge circadienne dans la physiopathologie du TB [2]. En effet, Il existe une littérature importante sur les anomalies circadiennes observées dans le TB (sommeil, rythmes veille/sommeil, chronotypes, perturbations circadiennes biologiques et comportementales, etc.). Ces anomalies sont présentes, non seulement en phase aiguë, mais aussi au cours des phases de stabilité de l’humeur (ou euthymiques) constituant ainsi des anomalies « trait » du TB [2]. Ainsi, l’exploration du sommeil et des rythmes circadiens chez des patients euthymiques avec TB par des mesures objectives (actigraphie) et subjectives (questionnaires) démontre que les patients présentent un sommeil plus long, de moins bonne qualité, avec retard important à l’endormissement, plus de réveils nocturnes et un retentissement diurne plus important que des témoins sains [3]. Par ailleurs, certains variants de gènes circadiens associés au TB peuvent s’associer chez les patients à des modifications particulières de ces rythmes circadiens. Ainsi, dans une étude pilote, il a été observé qu’un variant commun associé au TB du gène ASMT (codant pour l’une des deux enzymes de synthèse de la mélatonine) était associé à une modification des rythmes circadiens marquée par une période de sommeil allongée, une plus grande activité nocturne et une plus grande stabilité des rythmes [4]. Ces résultats intéressants soulignent l’intérêt de l’exploration des anomalies circadiennes du TB dans un but étiopathogénique et diagnostique, mais aussi possiblement thérapeutique.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiological condition characterized by a reversible behavioral state with changes in the level of awareness and responsiveness to stimuli and plays a fundamental role related to electrophysiological, neurochemical, anatomical and functional changes of the brain. It is controlled by chronobiological and homeostatic mechanisms and is intensely related to the periods of wakefulness. One of the most immediate results of the poor quality of sleep is the drop in performance on the next day, causing damage during wakefulness, such as drowsiness, mood fluctuations, anxiety, low self-esteem, slow thinking, memory loss, poor school and personal performance, and predisposition to accidents. Sleep plays an important role in the physical and emotional development of adolescents, who are going through a period of intense learning and differentiation. Paradoxically, however, nowadays, several factors contribute to the poor sleep of adolescents because of the social pressures that boost their activities such as excessive use of computer and phone, new affective relationships, parties, etc. All of these factors determine a reduction of nighttime sleep and consequent daytime sleepiness. The objective of the present study was to present some issues related to the physiology of the sleep-wake cycle and its implications in the daily life of teenagers, in an attempt to stimulate the thinking of professionals about the important aspects related to quality and quantity of sleep.",

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte.

      "title": "Jet lag: current and potential therapies.",
      "abstract": "Jet lag, also known as circadian desynchrony, is a sleep disorder in which there is a mismatch with the body’s natural circadian rhythm and the external environment as a result of rapid travel across multiple time zones. This common problem affects all age groups but may have more pronounced effects on the elderly, whose recovery rate is more prolonged than that in young adults.1\r\n\r\nA multitude of factors, such as the number of time zones crossed and the direction and timing of flights, play a role in the severity of symptoms experienced by travelers. Individual variability accounts for the ability to adapt to a new time zone and the duration of the symptomatic period. Travelers usually experience symptoms after air travel across at least two time zones. Symptoms may include disturbed sleep, daytime fatigue, decreased ability to perform mental and physical tasks, reduced alertness, and headaches. Sleep disturbances typically last for a few days, but they can persist for as long as one week if the change in time zones is greater than eight hours. Eastward travel is associated with a longer duration of jet lag than westward travel. Although frequent desynchrony is a transient disorder, it carries the potential to lead to long-term consequences, as evidenced by epidemiological and animal studies.2,3 Sequelae have included cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, and an increased risk of cancer, infertility, and heart disease. As the body’s internal circadian “clock” adapts to the new time zone, jet lag diminishes.\r\n\r\nStrategies to minimize the effects of jet lag include adjusting the sleep schedule according to the new location during the days preceding the trip. This approach may be helpful for travel that lasts for more than a week, but it does not appear useful for short-term trips. Both alcohol and caffeine can adversely affect quality of sleep when they are consumed a few hours before bedtime; caffeine intake should be planned to enhance daytime alertness. When passengers are traveling, they are advised to avoid alcohol, especially while they are being treated for jet lag.\r\n\r\nTreatment may include non-pharmacological therapy alone or non-pharmacological therapy combined with nutraceuticals or pharmacological therapy. A non-pharmacological approach, including adequate exercise, hydration, and appropriate timing of exposure to bright light, can aid in the adjustment to a new time zone. Nutraceuticals and pharmacological therapies include melatonin, melatonin receptor analogues (agonists), non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents, caffeine, diphenhydramine (e.g., Benadryl, McNeil; Aler-Dryl, Reese), and armodafinil (Nuvigil, Cephalon).\r\n\r\nA review of treatments and potential strategies follows.",

As the human body goes through the different stages of sleep, physiological changes in the breathing mechanism are present. Sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome, are often associated with sleep-disordered breathing and sleep deprivation. Hypoxia and hypercapnia coexist with lack of sleep and undermine multiple functions of the body (e.g., cardiovascular system, cognition, immunity). Among the general population, athletes suffer from these consequences more during their performance. This concept supports the beneficial restorative effects of a good sleeping pattern.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and napping are all highly prevalent among the elderly, reflecting changes in sleep architecture, sleep efficiency, sleep quality, and circadian sleep-wake cycles. Insomnia is sometimes associated with subjective daytime sleepiness, as well as other clinical and socioeconomic consequences. The daytime sleepiness will at times lead to napping. Although napping is viewed as a common age-related occurrence, little is known about its benefits or consequences. Factors reported to be contributors to daytime napping include sleep-maintenance difficulty and sleep fragmentation with consequent daytime sleepiness, nighttime use of long-acting sedating agents, daytime use of sedating medications, and dementia. However, a correlation between sleep disturbance and daytime napping has not been consistently observed. Whether napping is beneficial, neutral, or detrimental is an important issue, in light of conflicting findings regarding the impact of daytime napping on nighttime sleep and recent reports of an association between napping and adverse clinical outcomes, including increased mortality risk. Further research is needed to determine whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between napping and insomnia, and between napping and adverse clinical outcomes, and to explore the clinical implications of improving insomnia and reducing daytime napping. Clinical evaluations of hypnotic agents should assess efficacy for both improving insomnia symptoms (particularly sleep-maintenance difficulty, in the case of elderly patients) and reducing daytime sleepiness thatwould lead to inadvertent napping.",

      "abstract": "According to statistics, every third person on Earth has fainted at least once in their life, and for 25 % of them, short-term loss of consciousness occurs repeatedly. Scientifically, fainting is called a «syncope» state (the word «syncope» comes from the Greek syn meaning «with, together» and koptein — «to cut off, tear off»), and is characterized by a short-term loss of consciousness against the background of transient hypoperfusion of the brain and a drop in muscle tone. The duration of loss of consciousness is usually 20–30 seconds, after which people come to their senses on their own. After fainting, feelings of general weakness, overexhaustion, and fatigue are possible; for elderly people, the occurrence of retrograde amnesia is typical. In the vast majority of cases, syncope is of reflex origin, and only about 15 % of fainting is associated with pathology of the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Notably, in some cases the cause of syncope cannot be established [4].",

For those with PD, sleep is frequently disordered and this affects the waking day, including control of parkinsonism. Insomnia is a common problem in the general population and increases with aging. When we are young, we typically have no trouble getting adequate sleep. Teenagers left undisturbed on a Saturday morning will sleep till noon. As we age, getting to sleep or staying asleep often becomes increasingly difficult. Sometimes this relates to life stressors; lying in bed ruminating about the day’s events is a frequent cause of insomnia. Depression is a common human affliction and insomnia may be one symptom. Finally, some people simply have insomnia as part of their constitutional makeup.",

Parasomnias are classified according to the type of sleep in which they occur, namely non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep parasomnias (1). The first includes disorders of arousals, namely confusional arousals (and their recently identified variants of sleep-related abnormal sexual behaviors), sleep terrors, and sleepwalking. REM sleep parasomnias include REM sleep behavior disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorders. Other parasomnias include sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning, exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder. The latter shares many features with the disorders of arousals, being frequently associated to sleepwalking. Hence, parasomnias comprise a variety of abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, dreaming, and autonomic phenomena that emerge from sleep as an expression of an anomalous central nervous system activation during sleep.",

      "abstract": "When disease or trauma progresses to a critical state, the reaction of the endocrine system in creating homeostasis is essential for survival. The association between the severity of hormonal changes and outcome in terms of morbidity and mortality has led to the challenge of development of several endocrine treatments. During sepsis, nitric oxide-mediated apoptosis is observed in the neurons and glial cells of the cerebrovascular centers of the autonomic nervous system. It is probably one of the components of the circulatory dysfunction of sepsis. The regulation of different organs was neither linear nor independent however organs were found to behave as biological oscillators coupled to each other through neurological or hormonal communication pathways. Sepsis, because of systemic inflammatory responsive syndrome, disrupts these communication pathways and leads to organ failures. Endocrine hormonal issues related to the intensive care setting are common challenges to ICU specialists. Disruptions of the endocrine system in sepsis are characterized by 1) an increase in cortisol plasma levels with a loss of the circadian rhythm of its secretion; 2) hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance and rise in hyperglycemic hormones secretion; 3) relative vasopressin deficiency; and 4) euthyroid sick syndrome or non-thyroidal illness syndrome. This article discusses the dynamic changes of four main endocrine axes: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, insulin, vasopressin and thyroid during grave states of disease, when a patient is in critical condition.",

Middle age often is punctuated by recurrent episodes of stress which do not appear to have a basis in any specific event. These cycles of stress instead are a function of psychological development in mid-life, with stress resulting from the need to integrate newly differentiated aspects of experience which cannot be integrated with an existing cognitive system of beliefs and values. Reintegration of the cognitive structure to accommodate these new elements reduces the stress, leaving the adult changed with respect to certain beliefs about self or world. These reintegrations are facilitated by an internal locus of control and an articulate self-other differentiation, both of which are important for a positive response to stress in middle age.",

SRVAs peak around 02:00h-06:00h and 14:00h-16:00h, when daily sleepiness is naturally higher. Hence, time of day is a critical factor, as important as the duration of the drive. Most SRVAs are not due to sleep pathology. Many are work-related. Non-sleeping rest is no substitute for sleep. Sleep does not occur spontaneously without warning, and is preceded by feelings of increasing sleepiness of which drivers are quite aware. Driving impairment is usually worse than is realised by the sleepy driver. The best countermeasure is sleep, or even a short nap. Even more effective is the combination of a nap with caffeine.",

Various physiological functions such as sleep, arousal, blood pressure, body temperature, and hormone secretion are regulated in a 24-hour rhythm by this circuit. Somatic cells of other organs have a peripheral clock gene and by synchronizing the rhythm of the central and peripheral clocks, it is possible to live a healthy life. Due to aging and degenerative disease, circadian rhythm gradually collapses. Factors that can contribute to this include reduced expression of the time gene associated with photo stimulation, a reduction in neurotransmitter levels, and reduced melatonin production. Biological clocks play an important role in our emotions, cognitive function, and behavior. Sleep disorders and metabolic disease related to the circadian rhythm affect metabolic and endocrine activities via the autonomic nervous system and the intestinal bacterial flora. Shift work disorder is associated with insomnia and excessive drowsiness as individuals often work during their sleeping hours. Now time management is placed at the center of our society, and it is important to evaluate the medical risk of engaging in shift work. In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the stereotypical behaviors may be associated with time. In some patients, multiple timed behaviors occupy a considerable part of the patient's daily life. Stereotypical behaviors in FTD are often considered in contrast to obsessive-compulsive disease (OCD).

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder which causes failure of endogenous circadian rhythm cycles to synchronize to a 24-hour day. Despite an unknown prevalence in sighted people, it's thought to be rare. We present a case of a sighted patient with concurrent bipolar disorder who presented with excessive sleepiness since preadolescence, and was later found to have N24SWD. Report of case(s) A 29 year old woman with bipolar disorder presented with excessive daytime sleepiness and irregular sleep schedule since age 12. During her teenage years she often fell asleep at school, and she felt the sleepiness could be associated with psychotropic medication. As she grew up, despite her bipolar disorder was well-controlled, the daytime sleepiness persisted, which caused great challenge concentrating at work and difficulty holding a job. She denies cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or restless legs syndrome symptoms. She had no history of shift work or abnormal movements during sleep. Her bedtime advanced and cycled through a 24-hour period according to sleep diary. Her rise time maintains a consistent interval with her bedtime. Previously she had multiple sleep latency test and polysomnogram, after which she was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia. She was treated with several stimulants without much improvement. She was offered CBT-I but hasn’t gone. She failed trial of a standardized schedule and found it stressful. She tried melatonin and light therapy for a short time without much of success, she was subsequently started on tasimelteon and the clinical response is to be followed. Conclusion N24SWD is reportedly rare in the sighted population, with a possible different mechanism from that of the blind population. Behavioral and environmental factors might contribute to the dysynchrony between a normal central circadian pacemaker and a non-24-hour sleep-wake behavioral pattern. Our patient's sleepiness persisted despite her psychiatric disorders were in remission. Altered circadian rhythms are not uncommon in patients with psychiatric disorders, and circadian rhythm dysfunction may be a trait marker of bipolar disease. Some antidepressant are also found to cause potential iatrogenic circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Psychosocial interventions that target stabilizing daily rhythms in patients with concurrent psychiatric illness can be helpful. Support (if any)",

One of the most common complaints of parents of infants and toddlers is that their child either has difficulty going to bed or wakes multiple times per night. These nightly struggles can leave parents tired, frustrated, and very stressed. Sleep-onset associations are certain conditions that are necessary for a child to fall asleep at bedtime and then return to sleep with each normal arousal during the night. Limit-setting sleep disorder presents as bedtime stalling or refusal to go to bed at an appropriate time. When limits are set, children typically fall asleep quickly and easily. Behavioral insomnia of childhood impacts not only the functioning and behavior of the child, but also the entire household. Sleep problems in children also negatively impact parents and caregivers.",

Desarrollo. El insomnio es un trastorno que se presenta como una dificultad para iniciar o mantener el sueno. La etiologia del insomnio infantil presenta causas multifactoriales. Para poder comprender y diagnosticar el insomnio en la infancia es necesario conocer los mecanismos que intervienen en la genesis de la vigilia y del sueno y considerar la existencia de otros tipos de trastornos. El insomnio se presenta como un desequilibrio entre la inhibicion de los sistemas que mantienen el estado de vigilia y de aquellos otros encargados de activar los sistemas generadores del sueno. En el nino, este desequilibrio depende de la situacion de inmadurez funcional propia de cada edad. El insomnio infantil aparece, mas que como una falta de sueno, como una falta de adecuacion entre el ritmo y la necesidad de sueno propia del nino y su entorno familiar y social. La causa mas habitual del insomnio es ambiental, conductual y de orden psicologico. Ante esta situacion, el diagnostico del insomnio infantil se basa en determinar un diagnostico diferencial con parasomnias, trastornos motores del sueno y del despertar. Conclusiones. El insomnio infantil plantea problemas para identificar sus causas, para diferenciar entre el autentico insomnio y otros trastornos del sueno y para su resolucion, debido a la influencia que el ambiente y la conducta del nino tienen sobre el sueno.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain syndromes are associated with alterations in sleep continuity and sleep architecture. One perspective of this relationship, which has not received much attention to date, is that disturbances of sleep affect pain. To fathom this direction of cause, experimental human and animal studies on the effects of sleep deprivation on pain processing were reviewed. According to the majority of the studies, sleep deprivation produces hyperalgesic changes. Furthermore, sleep deprivation can counteract analgesic effects of pharmacological treatments involving opioidergic and serotoninergic mechanisms of action. The heterogeneity of the human data and the exclusive interest in rapid eye movement sleep deprivation in animals so far do not allow us to draw firm conclusions as to whether the hyperalgesic effects are due to the deprivation of specific sleep stages or whether they result from a generalized disruption of sleep continuity. The significance of opioidergic and serotoninergic processes as mediating mechanisms of the hyperalgesic changes produced by sleep deprivation are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Social jetlag (SJ) occurs when sleep-timing irregularities from social or occupational demands conflict with endogenous sleep–wake rhythms. SJ is associated with evening chronotype and poor mental health, but mechanisms supporting this link remain unknown. Impaired ability to retrieve extinction memory is an emotion regulatory deficit observed in some psychiatric illnesses. Thus, SJ-dependent extinction memory deficits may provide a mechanism for poor mental health. To test this, healthy male college students completed 7–9 nights of actigraphy, sleep questionnaires, and a fear conditioning and extinction protocol. As expected, greater SJ, but not total sleep time discrepancy, was associated with poorer extinction memory. Unexpectedly, greater SJ was associated with a tendency toward morning rather than evening chronotype. These findings suggest that deficient extinction memory represents a potential mechanism linking SJ to psychopathology and that SJ is particularly problematic for college students with a greater tendency toward a morning chronotype.",

Scientifically, fainting is called a «syncopal state» (the word «syncope» comes from the Greek syn — with, together; koptein — to cut off, to break off), and is characterized by short — term loss of consciousness against the background of transient hypoperfusion of the brain and a drop in muscle tone. The duration of loss of consciousness is usually 20–30 seconds, after which the person regains consciousness on his own. After fainting, there may be a feeling of general weakness, feelings of weakness, fatigue, and the occurrence of retrograde amnesia is characteristic for older people. In the vast majority of cases, syncopal conditions are of reflex origin, and only about 15 % of fainting are associated with pathology of the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. At the same time, in some cases, the cause of the syncopal condition cannot be determined [4].",

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

      "abstract": "Various physiological systems and behaviors such as the sleep-wake cycle, vigilance, body temperature, and the secretion of certain hormones are governed by a 24-hour cycle called the circadian system.While there are many external stimuli involved the regulation of circadian rhythm, the most powerful environmental stimulus is the daily light-dark cycle.Blind individuals with no light perception develop circadian desynchrony.This leads to non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder, which is associated with sleep-wake disorders, as well as mood disorders and loss of appetite and gastrointestinal disturbances due to disrupted circadian hormone regulation.As the diagnosis is often delayed because of under-recognition in clinical practice, patients must cope with varying degrees of social and academic dysfunction.Most blind individuals report that non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder affects them more than blindness.In the treatment of totally blind patients suffering from non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder, the first-line management is behavioral approaches.Drug therapy includes melatonin and the melatonin agonist tasimelteon.Diagnosing blind individuals' sleep disorders is also relevant to treatment because they can be improved with the use of melatonin and its analogues or by phototherapy if they have residual vision.Therefore, assessing sleep problems and planning treatment accordingly for individuals presenting with blindness is an important issue for ophthalmologists to keep in mind.",

      "abstract": "In contrast to newborns, who spend 16–20 h in sleep each day, adults need only about sleep daily. However, many elderly may struggle to obtain those 8 h in one block. In addition to changes in sleep duration, sleep patterns change as age progresses. Like the physical changes that occur during old age, an alteration in sleep pattern is also a part of the normal ageing process. As people age, they tend to have a harder time falling asleep and more trouble staying asleep. Older people spend more time in the lighter stages of sleep than in deep sleep. As the circadian mechanism in older people becomes less efficient, their sleep schedule is shifted forward. Even when they manage to obtain 7 or 8 h sleep, they wake up early, as they have gone to sleep quite early. The prevalence of sleep disorders is higher among older adults. Loud snoring, which is more common in the elderly, can be a symptom of obstructive sleep apnoea, which puts a person at risk for cardiovascular diseases, headaches, memory loss, and depression. Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder that disrupt sleep are more prevalent in older persons. Other common medical problems of old age such as hypertension diabetes mellitus, renal failure, respiratory diseases such as asthma, immune disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, physical disability, dementia, pain, depression, and anxiety are all associated with sleep disturbances.",

      "title": "Sleep, Depression and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle?",
      "abstract": "Sleep, depression and insomnia have manifold associations. Psychiatric sleep research in affective disorders has demonstrated that sleep in depression is characterized by an impairment of sleep continuity, deficits in slow wave sleep and a disinhibition of REM sleep (including shortened REM latency and increased REM density). Traditionally, insomnia, i.e. prolonged latency to fall asleep and increased frequency of nocturnal wake periods, was considered as an unspecific symptom of affective disorders. In the meantime, a shift in clinical and scientific focus has taken place viewing insomnia in addition as an independent diagnostic entity and as a clinical predictor of depression. Unfortunately, the neurobiological processes underlying the relationships between sleep, insomnia and depression have not been fully identified yet. It is clear that both insomnia and depression are characterized by alterations in the arousal system in the CNS presenting as hyperarousal. Moreover, insomniac patients display reduced and fragmented REM sleep periods, which might interfere negatively with basal processes of emotion regulation. The alterations in the arousal system and the interaction of it with the affect-regulatory system over the course of time might influence cognitive systems and hence lead to the clinical picture of depression. Given the suggestion of insomnia symptoms as possibly involved in the causation and the maintenance of psychopathology in general, this type of sequence might also be found in relation to other mental disorders.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONBruxism is psychopathophysiological disorder of orofacial muscle activity which is defined by American Academy of Orofacial Pain as a diurnal or nocturnal parafunctional activity including clenching, bracing, gnashing, and grinding of the teeth.1 The excessive and frequent nocturnal bruxist activity, unlike physiological muscular activity during sleep, results in non-physiological wear (attrition) of occlusal surfaces.2,3In multifactorial and often controversial bruxism etiology, peripheral (morphological) and central (physchological and pathophysiological) etiological factors can be distinguished.4 The most common morphological factors, such as occlusion (in particular occlusal discrepancies), along with the anatomy of the orofacial system have been considered more traditional than evidence based medicine and dentistry bruxism causative factors.4,5Bruxism is related to great number of pathophysiological factors. During sleep, sudden awakening or change in intensity of sleep may occur. That is arousal response. Then, generalized change of body activity occurs: higher heart rate, changes in breathing rhythm, peripheral vasoconstriction and muscular hyperactivity, including bruxism.6 Changes of the central neurotransmitter system in the nigrostriatal projection can cause the muscular activity disorders. Drug therapy can also induce bruxism: L-dopa, neuroleptics and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Numerous substances such as amphetamines, amphetamine-like substances, nicotine and alcohol can play major role in the etiology of bruxism, which has been particularly explained by effects via dopamine system.7Behavioral disorders and affective psychological factors, anxiety being one of the most prominent together with emotional stress, caused by sociological and psychological factors, can induce bruxism.8Dentistry and alcohol consumingAlcoholism is progressive mental disease with social and health consequences. The addiction to alcohol is more difficult to observe in early stages of alcoholism due to some traditional reasons related to alcohol consuming, which can have adverse side effects in dental treatment. Alcohol consumption leads to great number of systemic disorders, such as malnutrition and hypovitaminosis, neurological disorders, pathological changes in the digestive, cardiovascular and respiratory system.9,10Besides the poor oral hygiene, consumption of alcohol may cause oral diseases, periodontal diseases and premature tooth loss. Alcoholics are exposed to higher risk of orofacial trauma (for example, jaw fractures), fractures and even losing the removable dentures while under the influence of alcohol.11The aim of this paper is to give case report on Michigan splint treatment of very severe bruxism in female patient who was under psychiatric therapy due to alcohol consuming, which caused psychoorganic syndrome.CASE REPORTA previously treated 62 year old psychiatric female patient was referred to the Prosthodontic Department, School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb for prosthodontic treatment. She exhibited pronounced teeth abrasion.Psychiatric treatmentTaking her case history with the assistance of her son and from the available medical records of her previous psychiatric treatments, we found out that she had been an alcoholic for many years (F 10.2 diagnosis by the International Classification of Diseases - ICD) and subsequently developed pyschoorganic syndrome with characteristics of depression (F 10.7 diagnosis by the ICD). Although she has had the alcohol addiction problem for many years, her psychiatric treatment started in 2001. She was hospitalized for three months at the alcoholism ward and discharged in better health condition with recommendation to take 20 mg of fluoxetine in the morning and 3x5 mg of diazepam. In the same year, she was coming regularly for check-up in the Psychiatric patient clinic accompanied by her son who reported her abstinence from alcohol, but also less communication and more passiveness in behavior. …",

In later life, insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common. Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described.

      "abstract": "Sleep is commonly defined as a state in which physical activities and sensory perception are greatly reduced, and it is frequently associated with our body's recuperative period. However, research has shown that sleep is also required for other vital processes such as memory consolidation and normal physiological functioning. Extensive research has shown that the areas that control our sleeping behaviour are the hypothalamus, brain stem, midbrain, and amygdala. These areas coordinate events during the non-REM and REM phases of sleep-wake cycles. GABA and adenosine, two chemical neurotransmitters, are also involved and play an important role in our sleep cycle. Insomnia has caused a slew of psychological and physiological issues such as fatigue, decreased mental concentration, irritable nature and a higher risk of heart attacks and stroke. It has reduced the patient's quality of life of the patient and have a social impact on them. Primary insomnia is defined as the inability/absence of proper sleep and impaired daily life functioning. Secondary insomnia, on the other hand, is believed to result from pre-existing medical conditions, substance abuse, or as a side effect of certain drug therapy. Insomnia is diagnosed through physical examination and the use of electrical devices to monitor sleep behavior.",

      "title": "Sleep-related Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract As in many areas of sleep medicine, it is often a challenge deciding whether or not movements during sleep reflect truly abnormal nocturnal phenomenona or are simply physiological variants. Indeed, when asleep, subconscious shifts of body position occurring every 15 minutes or so are considered entirely normal, as are minor jerks of the extremities and face, particularly during periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. However, if nocturnal movements are observed to be excessive, violent, or arousing, either to the subject or bed partner, they will usually indicate a defined disorder, especially if the events are stereotypic through the night. Although the second edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) was revised in 2005 to include a new section dedicated to movement disorders occurring specifically during the state of sleep, diagnostic precision of such phenomena is often lacking and evidenced-based treatment protocols, when indicated, are poorly developed. Furthermore, if a sleep-related movement disorder is recognized, it can be very difficult to determine its true clinical significance for sleep quality and subsequent daytime wakefulness, especially in the elderly patient. This chapter addresses those movement disorders that are intimately or exclusively related to the state of sleep or the sleep–wake transition. By convention, parasomnias causing abnormal arousals from deep non-REM sleep, such as sleepwalking or night terrors, will not be covered, although restless legs syndrome is discussed, partly because of its close association with periodic limb movements during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be \"things that go bump in the night\", or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

Of the two forms the progressive types of dementia create by far the more frequent problem and, reflecting the increased longevity of the population, have become one of the major public health concerns of the Western world. Over 6% of adults aged over 65 years and 20% over the age of 80 are estimated to suffer from a medically or socially disabling degree of dementia.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders in childhood: a review.",
      "abstract": "Several studies in the last ten years have been directed towards a better understanding of sleep disorders in childhood. Defining sleep disorders in this age is difficult in dependence of relevant differences in sleep patterns at subsequent developmental stages. In new-borns total sleep time is fairly equal during night and day. Normally, day-time sleep gradually decreases over the first three years of life, such that night-time sleep progressively increases till the age of four, and similar to adult sleep-time by adolescence. The most frequent sleep disorders observed in childhood are parasomnias, that, thought to be a CNS sign of immaturity, tend to be quite predictable, recurring in the same families and not even influenced by environmental stimuli. These disorders included: a) arousal disorders, that generally emerge from delta sleep or relate to arousals occurring during NREM sleep, very common in childhood and fairly common in adulthood either; b) somnambulism and somniloquy, that have many common characteristics: first of all, they have the potential to generate a great sense of discomfort and fear in parents watching a child who suddenly sits up in bed eyes-opened but 'unseeing'; c) nocturnal enuresis, that is substantially not a problem of depth of sleep, despite many parents believe. Although narcolepsy is more common in adolescence, many studies have demonstrated that narcoleptic symptoms may begin in childhood. Narcoleptic symptoms in children are similar in their appearance to those predominant in adults, but their expression may be different because of CNS maturational factors. Historical descriptions of the OSAS evidenced since the beginning the importance of neurobehavioral complications associated with the cessation of airflow at the nose and mouth accompanied by respiratory effort, deriving from upper airway obstruction which occurs during sleep.",

Wake-pattern movement disorders improve during sleep but, contrary to common belief, they do not entirely disappear.

These disorders lead to harmful psychological and functional difficulties and certain personality disorders may also be related to them. It has been found that psychotropic drugs, SSRI and haloperidol can cause CRSD, and this is also true for some cases of minor head trauma.

As a biological signal, variations in the sounds and amounts of crying, including excessive crying or colic, have their foundations in autonomic and central nervous system mechanisms that regulate infant arousal and maintain homeostasis. Specific variants of these sounds and amounts of infant crying reflect insults to the integrity of nervous system function, thus providing the basis for spectral analysis of crying to be used in the early assessment of risk for poor developmental outcomes, including sudden infant death syndrome and autism. As a social behavior, crying is part of a synchrony of arousal within which increases in infant arousal produce cry sounds that elicit synchronous increases in caregiver arousal. Depending on their affective state, caregivers' heightened arousal provides the basis for either nurturant care or, in extreme cases, physical abuse and neglect.",

Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks.

      "title": "1485 Reviving the Sleep-Wake Cycle: Integrated Approaches to Circadian Rhythm and RLS Management in a Complex Case",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Circadian rhythm disorders, often misdiagnosed as primary insomnia, can be challenging to treat with medications alone. Effective management requires an integrated approach that combines behavioral therapy, circadian rhythm interventions, and lifestyle modifications[1,2]. This case details the treatment of a 59-year-old male with an irregular sleep-wake pattern, severe social anxiety, and restless legs syndrome (RLS). His treatment involved behavioral strategies and circadian rhythm interventions, resulting in significant improvements in his sleep and overall well-being. Report of case The patient presented with severe sleep disturbances, including spending up to 20 hours in bed per day, with a highly fragmented sleep schedule. His typical sleep pattern involved sleeping at 11:00 PM and waking at 3:15 AM, averaging 6–7 hours of broken sleep nightly, compounded by excessive daytime naps. Initial home sleep apnea testing revealed a total sleep time (TST) of 4 hours and 26 minutes, an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 0.7/hr, and a minimum oxygen saturation of 91%. Follow up polysomnography showed a TST of 175.5 minutes, with a sleep efficiency of 56%, an AHI of 1.0/hr, and a periodic limb movement index of 83.4/hour. An integrated treatment plan was initiated, combining cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i), sleep environment modifications, and lifestyle changes. The patient was encouraged to adhere to a consistent sleep-wake schedule and reduce time spent in bed during the day. Additionally, he started an exercise program to help manage his RLS symptoms and joined a senior center for increased social engagement. Several sedative medications, including melatonin, hydroxyzine, and trazodone were gradually discontinued. The patient now uses doxepin for insomnia and gabapentin a few times per week for RLS symptoms. Following these interventions, he was able to maintain consolidated nighttime sleep. His RLS symptoms also improved with regular physical activity. Conclusion This case illustrates the effectiveness of an integrated treatment approach combining behavioral therapy, circadian rhythm interventions, and lifestyle changes in managing complex sleep disorders like circadian rhythm dysfunction and RLS. The patient’s use of CBT-i, exercise, and improved sleep hygiene led to a significant reduction in sleep fragmentation and a more regular sleep-wake cycle, as reflected in the improvement in patient’s symptoms.

      "abstract": "Social jetlag (SJ) occurs when sleep-timing irregularities from social or occupational demands conflict with endogenous sleep–wake rhythms. SJ is associated with evening chronotype and poor mental health, but mechanisms supporting this link remain unknown. Impaired ability to retrieve extinction memory is an emotion regulatory deficit observed in some psychiatric illnesses. Thus, SJ-dependent extinction memory deficits may provide a mechanism for poor mental health. To test this, healthy male college students completed 7–9 nights of actigraphy, sleep questionnaires, and a fear conditioning and extinction protocol. As expected, greater SJ, but not total sleep time discrepancy, was associated with poorer extinction memory. Unexpectedly, greater SJ was associated with a tendency toward morning rather than evening chronotype. These findings suggest that deficient extinction memory represents a potential mechanism linking SJ to psychopathology and that SJ is particularly problematic for college students with a greater tendency toward a morning chronotype.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

      "abstract": "Healthy physiological processes require the complex interaction of multiple control systems operating over multiple time scales. The output of these processes (for example, heart rate, blood pressure, hormonal rhythms, or postural sway) demonstrates complex variability that can be quantified using the concept of fractals, derived from the field of nonlinear dynamics. Complex physiological dynamics enable an organism to rapidly respond to the internal and external perturbations of everyday life. Aging and disease are associated with a loss of complexity in the dynamics of many physiological systems. This loss of complexity may reduce the ability to adapt to stress and lead to the syndrome of frailty.",

      "abstract": "Numerious studies conducted over the last 40 years assessing different physiological domains including autonomic nervous system status, whole body and brain metabolic rate, stress and immune system activity suggest that (1) insomnia is a disorder of physiologic hyperarousal present throughout 24-hour sleep-wake cycle, and (2) insomnia and sleep loss are two distinct states. Central nervous system hyperarousal, either as pre-existing and/or induced by psychiatric pathology and worsened by stressful events, as well as aging- and menopause-related physiological decline of sleep mechanisms appears to be at the core of this common sleep disorder. Finally, there is emerging evidence that the levels of physiologic hyperarousal are directly related to the degree of polysomnographically documented sleep disturbance in insomnia patients, suggesting that objective measures of sleep duration in insomnia may be a useful marker of the medical severity of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "The internal circadian clock adapts slowly, if at all, to rapid transitions between different shift schedules. This leads to misalignment (desynchrony) of rhythmic physiological systems, such as sleep, alertness, performance, metabolism and the hormones melatonin and cortisol, with the imposed work–rest schedule. Consequences include sleep deprivation and poor performance. Clock gene variants may influence tolerance of sleep deprivation. Shift work is associated with an increased risk of major disease (heart disease and cancer) and this may also, at least in part, be attributed to frequent circadian desynchrony. Abnormal metabolism has been invoked as a contributory factor to the increased risk of heart disease. There is recent evidence for an increased risk of certain cancers, with hypothesized causal roles of light at night, melatonin suppression and circadian desynchrony. Various strategies exist for coping with circadian desynchrony and for hastening circadian realignment (if desired). The most important factor in manipulating the circadian system is exposure to and/or avoidance of bright light at specific times of the 'biological night'.",

      "abstract": "Today, prolonged wakefulness is a widespread phenomenon. Nevertheless, in the field of sleep and wakefulness, several unanswered questions remain. Prolonged wakefulness can be due to acute total sleep deprivation (SD) or to chronic partial sleep restriction. Although the latter is more common in everyday life, the effects of total SD have been examined more thoroughly. Both total and partial SD induce adverse changes in cognitive performance. First and foremost, total SD impairs attention and working memory, but it also affects other functions, such as long-term memory and decision-making. Partial SD is found to influence attention, especially vigilance. Studies on its effects on more demanding cognitive functions are lacking. Coping with SD depends on several factors, especially aging and gender. Also interindividual differences in responses are substantial. In addition to coping with SD, recovering from it also deserves attention. Cognitive recovery processes, although insufficiently studied, seem to be more demanding in partial sleep restriction than in total SD.",

As a consequence there is a sharp inhibition of conditioned and, in part, of unconditioned reflexes. Moreover, active cortical inhibition suffers particularly, and external inhibition is more pronounced. Upon \"return\" from this state of \"inhibition\" to the customary, real age or condition, one observes steady inhibition and, in some cases, positive induction. This confirms the presence of cortical inhibition in an arbitrarily induced condition of age or fatigue. If the subject regards himself as being of a younger age or in a more vigorous situation than usual, this will induce a certain increase in the reflexes.",

Using sleep deprivation, we studied the extent to which age- and psychopathology-related sleep \"decay\" is reversible in aged normal, depressed, and demented subjects. Depression or probable Alzheimer's dementia compromised the augmentation of sleep continuity and SWS seen in healthy elderly following sleep deprivation. Rapid eye movement (REM) latency decreased during recovery sleep in the controls but increased in both patient groups. Compared with demented patients, depressed elderly had greater severity of sleep continuity disturbance both before and after sleep deprivation, a more protracted course of recovery sleep, and increased slow-wave density in the second non-REM (NREM) sleep period (during recovery). The REM sleep time was diminished in dementia compared with depression both at baseline and during recovery sleep. These differential effects of age, health, and neuropsychiatric disease on recovery from sleep loss are relevant to recovery or reversal theories of sleep and have implications for daytime well-being in the elderly.",

A disordered sleep–wake cycle can have major effects on many common neurological complaints such as headache and epilepsy, and it may also directly affect important general health issues, such as blood pressure. Furthermore, sleep related disorders such as parasomnias, particularly with agitation, can be hazardous to patients and bed partners while also being diagnostic clues in some neurodegenerative diseases. The traditional view that sleep is simply the absence of wakefulness has been increasingly refined over the past 50 years or so. Rather, it is a precisely orchestrated and complex state with distinct and mutually exclusive phases: non-rapid eye movement (stages 1–4) and rapid eye movement sleep (non-REM and REM sleep, respectively), defined largely by the surface EEG. In a typical night, there are 4–5 cycles of non-REM and REM sleep (figure 1). In REM sleep, the cortical EEG is highly activated in common with wakefulness, usually corresponding to the vivid dreaming that accompanies REM sleep. REM sleep periods predominate towards the end of the nocturnal sleep period whereas the deepest stages of non-REM sleep (stages 3 and 4) tend to occur within an hour of sleep onset. Figure 1 (A) EEG waveforms that define wake and non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep stages. (B) An idealised hypnogram summarising the distribution of the sleep stages through a typical night. Black bars refer to REM sleep during which the EEG pattern returns to that seen in wakefulness. Given the normal variation in sleep patterns and habits between people, distinguishing whether or not a sleep related symptom suggests a formal disorder can be difficult. It is a salutary fact that normal ageing is associated with deteriorating and poorly consolidated nocturnal sleep.",

      "title": "Key Facts About Tinnitus",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there is no external sound present, often described as a ringing, buzzing, humming, clicking, or cicada-like sound. Less commonly, tinnitus can be heard as a musical tune or a pulsing sound in time with a person's heartbeat. It may be one or multiple sounds, and it may be constant or intermittent. It can be heard as coming from one or both ears or from within the head. Research shows that most people hear tinnitus when they are asked to listen in a very quiet environment (i.e., when sitting in a sound-proof booth). Tinnitus is common and reported in all age groups. CAUSE AND HABITUATION The exact cause of tinnitus is hard to pinpoint, but it is generally understood that it results from some type of change, either mental or physical, but not necessarily related to the ear. Tinnitus can be associated with noise exposure, hearing loss, middle ear pathology or dysfunction, impacted wax, head or neck injuries, some medications, or a period of high stress. In many instances, the cause or the trigger is unknown. Tinnitus may dissipate over time or a person may habituate to it such that even though it may be audible, it is of little consequence. In some people, the tinnitus can be intrusively bothersome and significantly affect their general well-being. Seek assistance if the tinnitus: is associated with hearing difficulties. presents or changes suddenly. becomes intrusive and bothersome. interferes with sleep and/or your ability to concentrate. impacts general well-being. is in one ear only. Individuals with tinnitus are often told that “there is nothing that can be done” or that “you will have to learn to live with it,” but this is not the case. While there is no cure, treatment options are available, and patients can successfully manage the tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a concern. Consult a general practitioner to address any underlying medical factor that may be contributing to the tinnitus. Some people require a more involved intervention, and those with distressing tinnitus often benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. In addition to a general practitioner, an ENT specialist, and an audiologist/a tinnitus specialist, others who may be involved in the rehabilitation process include physiotherapists, counsellors, sleep specialists, and/or temporomandibular joint dental specialists. Factors influencing your ability to get used to the tinnitus include current stress levels and coping abilities, emotional and physical support systems, and insight into the mechanisms of the tinnitus. Plus, understanding how all of the above interact. FINDING SUPPORT Your experience of tinnitus and its impact on your life are unique, so it's important to seek the assistance of a tinnitus specialist who can offer a holistic, evidence-based tinnitus program designed specifically for your personal situation. A tinnitus management program should provide you with a deeper understanding of tinnitus and strategies you can use to manage and reduce the symptoms. These strategies may include a combination of: sound enrichment hearing devices neuromonics treatment behavioral techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance commitment therapy stress reduction and relaxation strategies sleep solutions TINNITUS AND HEARING If the tinnitus is accompanied by any hearing loss, the use of hearing aids can be helpful on a number of levels. Well-fitted hearing aids assist with communication, help reduce the stress and fatigue associated with intensive listening, and amplify low-level background sound. This can result in a reduction in tinnitus awareness. There are also devices that combine a hearing aid and a noise generator in a single unit, and these can provide the benefits of both. The timing and sequence of different types of intervention can play an important role in how individuals respond to treatment. A person with chronic tinnitus may be grieving for the perceived loss of silence and how this is affecting his or her life. This person may not be ready for certain types of intervention (e.g., hearing aids, maskers), and may even reject any early intervention. Before the rehabilitation process begins, it is helpful for the individual to be in a place of acceptance and to start coping emotionally.

Fast conjugate refixation movements are generated by the saccadic system, steady viewing and smooth tracking by the pursuit and optokinetic systems, and the vergence system maintains alignment for objects moving towards or away from the observer. The vestibular ocular system removes the potentially destabilizing effects of head movement by producing eye movements that are equal and opposite to the head movement, providing a stable setting for the other eye movement systems to operate. Isolated supranuclear motility disorders result in palsies of conjugate movement affecting one or more of the movement systems (so-called 'gaze palsies') in which diplopia is absent as parallelism of the visual axes is maintained. A dysconjugate gaze palsy results from a disruption of premotor or internuclear connections to the ocular motor nuclei, leading to a bilateral asymmetrical or unilateral limitation of movement.",

There are approximately 20 000 people with narcolepsy in the United Kingdom, 100 000 in the United States. The diagnosis of narcoleptic syndrome is established by the history of recurrent daily short sleep attacks in combination with cataplexy, brief episodes of loss of muscle tone and paralysis. Narcolepsy often results from monotony, and cataplexy is usually due to a sudden increase in alertness, with laughter or surprise. About one-half of all subjects also have sleep paralysis, and many describe vivid dreams at sleep onset, or even during wakefulness. In classic cases, the diagnosis is obvious from the history, and also from the finding of at least two sleep-onset REM periods during a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The MSLT gives an index of daytime drowsiness, with measurement of the time of sleep onset at 2-h intervals on five occasions throughout the day.",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "abstract": "Hypertension and insomnia are very common and often coexist. There is evidence to suggest that the increasing prevalence of arterial hypertension in the past decade might be related both to an increased prevalence of insomnia and to the decline of sleep duration due to modern lifestyle. The aim of this paper is to reconsider both the clinical evidence of the relationship between conditions of sleep loss and of perceived impairment in sleep quality with hypertension and the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the biological plausibility of their relationship. Through a systematic search from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO we selected articles, which reported experimental sleep deprivation designs, or studied sleep duration or insomnia and their relationship with blood pressure or hypertension in participants over 18 years. This analysis shows that experimental sleep deprivation, short sleep duration, and persistent insomnia are associated with increased blood pressure and increased risk of hypertension, even after controlling for other risk factors. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this association might be related to inappropriate arousal (\"hyperarousal\") due to an overactivation of stress system functions. According this hypothesis, prolonged sleep loss or alterations of sleep quality might act as a neurobiological and physiologic stressor that impair brain functions and contribute to allostatic load, compromising stress resilience and somatic health.

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

      "abstract": "Relatively little is known about the neurobiology of insomnia, despite its wide prevalence and broad medical impact. Although much is still to be learned about the pathophysiology of the disorder, identification, systematic assessment, and appropriate treatment are clearly beneficial to patients. Recent research, using quantitative EEG, polysomnography (PSG), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and neuroimaging techniques, suggests that some broad areas can be identified as possible pathophysiological models. Sleep-wake homeostat model hypothesizes a failure in homeostatic regulation of sleep, an attenuated increase in sleep drive with time awake, and/or defective sensing of sleep need. Circadian clock model hypothesizes a dysfunctional circadian clock, resulting in changes in the timing of sleep-wake propensity that are incompatible with normal sleep. Intrinsic sleep-wake state mechanism model suggests that abnormal function of insomnia comprises the systems responsible for expression of the sleep states themselves. Extrinsic over-ride mechanism (stress-response) model suggests that insomnia reflects the consequences of overactivity of one of the systems considered extrinsic to normal sleep-wake control. Many current therapies for insomnia are based on these physiological models. Several attempts have been made to create a physiological model that would explain this disorder and could be used as a foundation for treatment. However, it appeared that no model can fully explain and clarify all aspects of insomnia. Future research should be necessary to expand our knowledge on the biological dimensions of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Sleep occupies one-third of a person's lifetime and is a necessary condition for maintaining physiological function and health. With the increase in social and economic pressures, the growing use of electronic devices and the accelerated aging process of the population, insufficient sleep and its hazards have drawn widespread attention from researchers in China and abroad. Sleep deprivation refers to a decrease in sleep or a severe lack of sleep due to various reasons. Previous studies have found that sleep deprivation can cause extensive damage to the body, including an increased incidence and mortality rate of neuropathic diseases in the brain, cardiovascular diseases, imbalances in the gut microbiota, and other multi-organ diseases. The mechanisms underlying the occurrence of multi-system and multi-organ diseases due to sleep deprivation mainly involve oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and impaired immune function in the body. According to traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), sleep deprivation falls into the category of sleepiness, and long-term sleepiness leads to Yin-Yang imbalance, resulting in the consumption of Qi and damage to the five Zang-organs. The appropriate treatment should focus on tonifying deficiency, reinforcing healthy Qi, and harmonizing Yin and Yang. TCM is characterized by a wide variety and abundant resources, and it has minimal side effects and a broad range of applications. Numerous studies have shown that TCM drugs and prescriptions not only improve sleep but also have beneficial effects on liver nourishment, intelligence enhancement, and kidney tonification, effectively preventing and treating the body injury caused by sleep deprivation. Given the increasing prevalence of sleep deprivation and its significant impact on body health, this article reviewed sleep deprivation-mediated body injury and its mechanism, summarized and categorized TCM compound prescriptions and single drugs for preventing and treating body injury, with the aim of laying the foundation for researchers to develop effective drugs for preventing and treating body injury caused by sleep deprivation and providing references for further exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the body injury caused by sleep deprivation.",

Systemic hypertension and most of the severe arrhythmias recorded during sleep were secondary to repetitive obstructive apnonea and were mediated through the autonomic nervous system. Sleep related elevations of pulmonary arterial pressure were not influenced by atropine or impaired autonomic functions. Upper airway sleep apnoea is sleep related; the type of sleep (REM or NREM) is critical in the appearance of abnormalities. The distinction between two patient subgroups (total sleep dependent and NREM sleep dependent) has haemodynamic, and possibly long-term, implications. Sleep apnoea syndrome should be looked for in pateints with the Shy-Drager syndrome.",

Sleep problems occur frequently in the general population, and are even more common in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI patients have restless sleep, complain of spasms, difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, snoring, often awaking in the early hours of the morning and are unable to fall asleep again, and during the day time they are tired and sleepy. Patients with SCI often say they sleep less or don?t feel rested when they wake up. Studies have been reported that sleep disturbances have potential negative impact and sleep disorders can hinder the rehabilitation process and affect global outcomes in patients with spinal cord injury. It is important to assess the presence of sleep problems in SCI patients, and to provide effective treatments when indicated for their compliance of rehabilitation program and increasing quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Disturbances of the sleep-wake pattern constitute one of the major complaints of patients with a wide range of psychiatric conditions, including major depression disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, eating disorders, and alcohol abuse. Recent advances have cast light on the mecanisms underlying modifications in sleep in psychiatric disorders, offering new approaches in management and opening new avenues of research. Isnomnia and psychiatric disorders, especially depression, are intimately linked. Insomnia, defined as a difficulty in initiating and/or in maintaining sleep leading to daytime repercussions, is not simply a symptom of depression but an independent diagnostic entity, and is known to be an independent risk factor for both depression itself and the development of a new depression episode or relapse. To date, the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the relationships between insomnia and affective disorders are not yet fully understood. The review by Chiara Baglioni et al. examines the latest findings from several fields of research, with particular attention to alterations of the arousal system leading to hyperarousal and to the possible biological mechanisms involved in the link between sleep alteration, insomnia, regulation of emotion, and mood symptoms. Links between depression sleep and circadian rhythms have long been suspected due to the existence of seasonal depression, where the onset of low mood correlates with a reduction in day length. Seasonal affective disorder (SA) is primarily a circadian rhythm disorder. Alfred Lewy discusses the theory of misalignement between the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion and the midpoint of the sleep bout, and emphasise the importance or careful timing of treatment administration (bright light or melatonin). Timing of treatment administration requiring detailed information on patients’ phase state and the role of new accessible tools such as dim light melatonine onset are evaluated as are different treatment modalities. The importance of biological rhythms in SA disorder has led to an interest in the role of circadian rhythms in the development of depression. The successes of chronobiotic treatments for SA disorder have led to the trialling of psychological and pharmacological treatments targeting circadian rhythms in unipolar major depression (MDD). The review by Sarah Hartley et al. focuses on the research linking circadian rhythms and depression, and on the evidence for effectiveness of chronobiotic treatments such as high intensity light, melatonin or melatonin agonist or behavioural therapy in MDD. The evidence base for novel antidepressants combining 5HT2c antagonist and melatonin agonist action in acute treatment of unipolar MDD and in relapse prevention is reviewed as is their use in clinical management of MDD. Managing bipolar disorder is a challenge for psychiatrists and it has been long known that sleep disorders are a sign of relapse. Carole Boudebesse et al. examine the evidence that sleep and circadian rhythms are disturbed in bipolar patients during both mood episodes and periods of remission. Therapeutic applications of chronobiology in bipolar disorder, such as specific psychosocial interventions, light therapy and physical exercise are described. Finally, psychiatrists are faced with frequent reports of sleep disorders in adults and children with attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and, conversely, sleep specialists report certain symptoms of ADHD (attention deficits, fidgeting) in patients suffering from primary sleep disorders. Are ADHD symptoms secondary to sleep fragmentation due to sleep disorders such as sleep disordered breathing and periodic legs movements, and treatable with treatment of these specific disorders? Could some ADHD subjects share a common deficit in the sleep/wake regulation systems resulting in sleep fragmentation? The pathophysiological relationship between sleep disorders and ADHD is complex and probably multidirectional. The hot topic from the team of Astrid Claret et al. reviews the latest research and aims to help clinicians in developing a framework for understanding and treating patients suffering from ADHD and sleep disorders.",

Subjective sleep quality may be poor even when the objective sleep quality is normal. Menopausal sleep disruption can aggravate other pre-existing sleep disorders including the restless legs syndrome (RLS) or circadian disorders. Co-morbidities without direct link with menopause as well as stressful changes in social environment coinciding with menopause should not be overlooked when exploring the etiology of insomnia in middle-aged women.",

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia is associated with social, economic, and individual burdens, including loss of independence, poor quality of life, and disability. In a short period of time, ideas about sarcopenia transformed from geriatric syndrome to disease. Initially, sarcopenia was considered in the context of gradual age-related deterioration in the functioning of all physiological systems. Over the years, it became clear that it can develop a second time, as a consequence of various diseases and pathological conditions. To date, there have been no generally accepted diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia. There are several tests and tools available for screening sarcopenia, the choice of which depends on physical capabilities of the patient, capabilities of the medical institution, and the purpose for which it is detected (research or clinical practice). From the point of view of human health, sarcopenia increases the risk of falls and fractures; impairs the ability to perform daily activities; is associated with the progression of major diseases and cognitive impairments; leads to movement disorders; contributes to a decrease in the quality of life, loss of independence or a need for long-term care. The presence of sarcopenia increases both the risk of hospitalization and hospitalization costs. The aim of the literature review is to provide an analysis of up-to-date information on the causes, pathogenesis, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and consequences of sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and sarcopenic obesity. The search for literature containing information on relevant studies was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar by the following keywords: sarcopenia, dynapenia, myosteatosis, sarcopenic obesity, nutritional status, malnutrition.",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

Additionally, sleep disorders can have serious consequences, including fatal accidents related to sleepiness. Disturbed sleep can be a primary diagnosis itself or a component of another medical or psychiatric disorder. Narcolepsy is plausibly caused by an abnormality of REM-inhibiting mechanisms, and recent research involving hypocretin, a neurotransmitter, suggests that hypocretin is significantly reduced in narcolepsy patients. Patients with delayed and advanced sleep phase insomnia can be treated with proper timing of bright light and behavioral changes. Hypersomnia related to a mental disorder is usually found in a variety of conditions such as the early stages of mild depressive disorder, grief, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and somatoform disorders.",

      "title": "Stay Awake! Understanding, Diagnosing, and Successfully Managing Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. (1) When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. (2) Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. (3,4) In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. (5) The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; TABLE 1). (6,7) Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness (FIGURE 1). This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed. Overview of narcolepsy Narcolepsy is a chronic, neurologic sleep disorder that results from the dysregulation of sleep-wake cycles. (8,9) Its 4 classic symptoms are EDS, cataplexy (a sudden drop in muscle tone that is triggered by emotional factors), sleep paralysis (a generalized flaccid paralysis that happens slightly before or at the time of falling asleep or on awakening), and hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations that occur while falling asleep). (8,10,11) EDS is the symptom that is experienced by almost all patients with narcolepsy. (10) Cataplexy is present in about 70% of patients with narcolepsy, whereas sleep paralysis (30% to 50%) and hypnagogic hallucinations (20% to 40%) are experienced less often; all 4 symptoms are present in an estimated 11% to 14% of patients with narcolepsy. (11) Although the origins of narcolepsy are still not well known, clinical understanding of the neurologic dysfunction that underlies narcolepsy as well as treatment options have increased markedly in the last decade. Prevalence and risk factors According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, narcolepsy is the third most frequently diagnosed primary sleep disorder found in patients who seek treatment at sleep clinics, after obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. (8) Narcolepsy appears throughout the world in every racial and ethnic group, but prevalence rates vary. (8,12) Reports in the United States estimate a prevalence of 1 per 2000 population, whereas the prevalence in Japan is considerably higher (about 1 per 600 population) and in Israel it is much lower (about 1 per 500,000 population). (8,9,11,12) Its incidence has been estimated to be about 0.74 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with cataplexy, and 1.37 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. (13) Although narcolepsy is about as common as multiple sclerosis, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated (8,12); the delay between the emergence of the initial symptoms and diagnosis is usually more than 10 years. (14) [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] The initiating event for narcolepsy is not well understood, but infection, immune system dysfunction, trauma, hormonal changes, or stress may be present before narcoleptic symptoms become manifest. …",

      "title": "Problemas para dormir—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Los problemas para dormir son comunes en los niños con y sin trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés). Entre la mitad y un tercio de los niños con TEA tienen problemas para dormir. Esto puede causar problemas durante el día, como falta de atención, irritabilidad o exhibición de más comportamientos repetitivos. La cantidad de horas de sueño durante la noche que necesitan los niños en edad preescolar, en general, es de 10 a 13 horas. A medida que crecen, el tiempo se reduce. Para los 13 años, la cantidad habitual de sueño necesaria es de entre 8 y 11 horas. Los problemas para dormir pueden afectar también a los padres y cuidadores, además del niño, porque los padres pierden horas de sueño al estar atendiendo a un niño que está despierto.Los niños con TEA pueden tener muchos motivos para no dormir. Las causas pueden ser médicas, de comportamiento o ambas. Las causas médicas de los problemas para dormir pueden incluir alergias, problemas para respirar y reflujo gastroesofágico (molestias estomacales).Los medicamentos también pueden afectar el sueño. Los motivos de comportamiento que causan problemas para dormir pueden ser cambios en las rutinas diarias o de la hora de acostarse, estrés en casa o en la escuela, cambio de cuidadores o cualquier otra cosa que rompa el patrón habitual de su hijo.El sueño tiene ciclos con distintos patrones de ondas cerebrales. Estos patrones pueden ser distintos en algunas personas con TEA. Es posible que las personas con TEA tengan el sueño más liviano y sueñen menos más tarde en la noche. Ese es el momento en que frecuentemente ocurre el despertar durante la noche. La hormona llamada melatonina es producida por el cerebro para controlar el sueño. Algunos estudios científicos muestran que las personas con TEA posiblemente no tengan la misma cantidad o actividad de melatonina.Algunos problemas para dormir incluyen:El médico de su hijo puede realizarle un examen físico general y obtener los antecedentes de problemas de salud y para dormir. Trate de llevar un diario del sueño durante un tiempo para ayudar al médico del niño a comprender los hábitos de sueño de su hijo. Informe al médico del niño si su hijo ronca fuerte o si tiene problemas de respiración por la noche y cualquier otra afección de salud que pudiera tener su hijo. El pediatra del niño podría pedirle pruebas si la historia clínica o el resultado del examen físico sugirieran que hay motivos médicos que causan los problemas de sueño.Los estudios han demostrado que las estrategias de comportamiento ayudan más que los medicamentos a mejorar los problemas para dormir. Estos son algunos pasos que pueden ayudar:En ocasiones, el solo hecho de crear buenos hábitos de sueño ayuda con los problemas para dormir, pero tal vez se necesiten otras medidas.Muchos niños con TEA responden a las órdenes y a las recompensas al intentar cambiar sus comportamientos. Repase junto a su hijo lo que espera que haga, con anticipación y nuevamente cada noche. Piense en la posibilidad de usar una tabla de imágenes o una historia para describir la rutina de la hora de acostarse. Si su hijo se ha quedado en la cama, ofrézcale una recompensa por la mañana, como un dulce que le guste, un juego o un ratito para usar pantallas.Si los problemas para dormir continúan después de establecer un buen lugar para que su hija duerma y una rutina para dormir adecuadas, tal vez desee agregar el paso de ignorarla cuando lo llame desde su cama. Cuando deje a su hija en la habitación, diga “buenas noches” y felicítela por irse a la cama. Luego vaya a controlarla en los momentos en que usted haya decidido hacerlo (generalmente cada pocos minutos) e ignórela entre los controles. Extienda el tiempo entre los controles durante la noche y en el transcurso de los días siguientes. Cuando vaya a controlar, échele un vistazo a la habitación. Si su hija está despierta, dígale que se duerma y luego váyase. No hay problema si su hija se duerme en el piso.Es muy importante que todos los cuidadores respeten este paso; hable con el resto de su familia sobre este plan antes de implementarlo. Si vive en un apartamento o condominio, tal vez también quiera hablar con sus vecinos. Los llantos y berrinches de su hija empeorarán durante varios días, pero con el tiempo mejorarán. Es fundamental que respete su plan y lo lleve adelante de la misma manera durante al menos 2 semanas, de principio a fin, para poder notar una diferencia. Tal vez necesite ayuda adicional para hacer esto, ya que puede ser difícil y agotador para padres y cuidadores.Algunos niños con TEA necesitan atención permanente para mantenerlos a salvo debido a sus comportamientos. Si su hija corre riesgo de lastimarse cuando no la esté supervisando y suele despertarse mucho durante la noche, pruebe las siguientes medidas de seguridad:El pediatra de su hija puede sugerir el uso de medicamentos recetados o de venta libre junto con el entrenamiento del comportamiento. Debe hablar con el médico de su hija antes de probar cualquier medicamento o suplemento herbal para su hija.Si aplicó este consejo todos los días durante 2 semanas y su hija sigue teniendo problemas para dormir, debe hablar con el pediatra de la niña. Hay otras intervenciones del comportamiento que se pueden usar.Los problemas muy difíciles deberán ser consultados con un experto en el sueño.La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra. Puede que haya variaciones en el tratamiento que le recomiende su pediatra basándose en los hechos y circunstancias individuales.

      "abstract": "Depression is a life-threatening psychiatric disorder and a major public health concern worldwide with an incidence of 5% and a lifetime prevalence of 15%–20%. It is related with the social disability, decreased quality of life, and a high incidence of suicide. Along with increased depressive cases, health care cost in treating patients suffering from depression has also surged. Previous evidence have reported that depressed patients often exhibit altered circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythm involves physical, mental, and behavioral changes in a daily cycle, and is controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus in responding to light and darkness in an environment. Circadian rhythm disturbance in depressive patients causes early morning waking, sleep disturbances, diurnal mood variation, changes of the mean core temperature, endocrine release, and metabolic functions. Many medical interventions have been used to treat depression; however, several adverse effects are noted. This article reviews the types, causes of depression, mechanism of circadian rhythm, and the relationship between circadian rhythm disturbance with depression. Pharmaceutical and alternative interventions used to treat depressed patients are also discussed.",

      "title": "Too little or too much nocturnal movements in Parkinson’s disease: A practical guide to managing the unseen",
      "abstract": "Nocturnal and sleep-related motor disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a wide spectrum of manifestations and present a complex clinical picture. Problems can arise due to impaired movement ability (hypokinesias), e.g. nocturnal hypokinesia or early-morning akinesia, or to excessive movement (hyperkinesias), e.g. end-of-the-day dyskinesia, parasomnias, periodic limb movement during sleep and restless legs syndrome. These disorders can have a significant negative impact on the sleep, daytime functional ability, and overall quality of life of individuals with PD and their carers. The debilitating motor issues are often accompanied by a combination of non-motor symptoms, including pain and cramping, which add to the overall burden. Importantly, nocturnal motor disorders encompass a broader timeline than just the period of sleep, often starting in the evening, as well as occurring throughout the night and on awakening, and are not just limited to problems of insomnia or sleep fragmentation. Diagnosis can be challenging as, in many cases, the 'gold standard' assessment method is video polysomnography, which may not be available in all settings. Various validated questionnaires are available to support evaluation, and alternative approaches, using wearable sensors and digital technology, are now being developed to facilitate early diagnosis and monitoring. This review sets out the parameters of what can be considered normal nocturnal movement and describes the clinical manifestations, usual clinical or objective assessment methods, and evidence for optimal management strategies for the common nocturnal motor disorders that neurologists will encounter in people with PD in their clinical practice.",

Primary sleep disturbances are thought to be a disorder of hyperarousal, while a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction has also been confirmed. Secondary sleep disorders have been associated with a large number of potential causes, both physical and psychological. Sleep disturbances in palliative care can be due to either the advanced disease and/or its treatment. Chronic medication use, neurological or psychiatric disorders, as well as environmental factors, can also present contributing factors.

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is seen by the insurance industry and many health care providers as an \"event.\" Once treated and provided with a brief period of rehabilitation, the perception exists that patients with a TBI require little further treatment and face no lasting effects on the central nervous system or other organ systems. In fact, TBI is a chronic disease process, one that fits the World Health Organization definition as having one or more of the following characteristics: it is permanent, caused by non-reversible pathological alterations, requires special training of the patient for rehabilitation, and/or may require a long period of observation, supervision, or care. TBI increases long-term mortality and reduces life expectancy. It is associated with increased incidences of seizures, sleep disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, neuroendocrine dysregulation, and psychiatric diseases, as well as non-neurological disorders such as sexual dysfunction, bladder and bowel incontinence, and systemic metabolic dysregulation that may arise and/or persist for months to years post-injury. The purpose of this article is to encourage the classification of TBI as the beginning of an ongoing, perhaps lifelong process, that impacts multiple organ systems and may be disease causative and accelerative. Our intent is not to discourage patients with TBI or their families and caregivers, but rather to emphasize that TBI should be managed as a chronic disease and defined as such by health care and insurance providers. Furthermore, if the chronic nature of TBI is recognized by government and private funding agencies, research can be directed at discovering therapies that may interrupt the disease processes months or even years after the initiating event.",

      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness is a significant public health problem, with prevalence in the community estimated to be as high as 18%. Sleepiness is caused by abnormal sleep quantity or sleep quality. Amongst others, multiple neurological, psychological, cardiac and pulmonary disorders may contribute. Risk factors for excessive sleepiness include obesity, depression, extremes of age and insufficient sleep. In the clinical setting, two of the most commonly encountered causes are obstructive sleep apnoea and periodic limb movement disorder. There is continuing discussion of the mechanisms by which these disorders cause daytime symptoms, with intermittent nocturnal hypoxia, sleep fragmentation and autonomic dysregulation identified as important factors. The increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea in obese subjects does not fully account for the increased rates of daytime sleepiness in this population and there is evidence to suggest that it is caused by metabolic factors and chronic inflammation in obese individuals. Sleepiness is also more common in those reporting symptoms of depression or anxiety disorders and significantly impacts their quality of life. Clinicians should be aware of factors which put their patients at high risk of daytime sleepiness, as it is a debilitating and potentially dangerous symptom with medico-legal implications. Treatment option should address underlying contributors and promote sleep quantity and sleep quality by ensuring good sleep hygiene. However, stimulant medication may be indicated in some cases to allow for more normal daytime functioning.",

      "title": "Rythmes endocriniens en période de dépression et de rémission",
      "abstract": "Résumé La participation des rythmes biologiques circadiens à la pathogénie de la dépression repose sur une série d’arguments cliniques, thérapeutiques et biologiques. La recrudescence matinale des symptômes dépressifs oriente vers une anomalie de l’organisation temporelle. Les aspects épidémiologiques de la dépression ou des suicides évoquent, quant à eux, l’existence de recrudescence saisonnière dans laquelle les facteurs naturels de synchronisation pourraient jouer un role. De plus, les thérapeutiques de la dépression agissent directement sur les horloges biologiques, qu’il s’agisse des manipulations du cycle veille/sommeil, de la photothérapie ou des antidépresseurs. Notre étude longitudinale a permis de comparer les rythmes circadiens de cortisol, de TSH et de mélatonine plasmatique chez des sujets déprimés ( n = 16), chez des sujets en rémission clinique ( n = 15) ainsi que chez des sujets sains ( n = 16). Nos résultats montrent de profondes perturbations du système circadien endocrinien en période dépressive. L’anomalie essentielle semble porter sur l’amplitude des rythmes, les sécrétions nocturnes de TSH et de mélatonine étant effondrées chez les sujets dépressifs. Ces perturbations disparaissent avec l’amélioration clinique des sujets. Nos résultats confirment, dans une certaine mesure, les interrelations temporelles et fonctionnelles qui existent entre les sécrétions de cortisol, de TSH et de mélatonine. Par ailleurs, l’absence de décalage horaire de la position des rythmes étudiés incite à nuancer l’hypothèse d’une désynchronisation biologique dans la dépression pour privilégier une défaillance des mécanismes de couplage entre les facteurs synchronisants de l’environnement et les oscillateurs centraux. Dans cette perspective, les traitements de la dépression tels que les manipulations du cycle veille/sommeil, la photothérapie ainsi que les tricycliques semblent agir sur ces mécanismes de transmission de l’information temporelle soit en augmentant artificiellement leur intensité, soit en abaissant le seuil de perception. Cette hypothèse pourrait aboutir à concevoir de nouveaux outils thérapeutiques des troubles de l’humeur.",

In the healthcare field, sufficient sleep is imperative to ensure optimal patient care. Sleep deprivation can result in greater procedural errors, which places the clients at risk. Insufficient sleep negatively affects the nervous system, resulting in poor brain function. Because of the cognitive decline that is associated with sleep deprivation, academic performance is often decreased. In order to combat the phenomenon of sleep deprivation, positive lifestyle behaviors and sleep hygiene should be maintained. For students, academic and financial demands can contribute to physiological stress, which may cause impaired sleep quality. In particular, poor sleep quality, insomnia, and daytime sleepiness are reportedly prevalent in college students. Therefore, it is crucial that the effects of sleep deprivation in university students be further studied and interventions to alleviate the problem be explored.",

L’association avec les troubles du sommeil est décrite chez 25 % à 50 % des enfants et chez plus de la moitié des adultes présentant un TDA/H. La question de cette comorbidité pose question. En effet, Il n’est pas clair à l’heure actuelle si les troubles du sommeil sont intrinsèques au TDA/H ou s’ils se produisent à la suite d’un trouble primaire du sommeil sous-jacent. En effet, il est décrit des symptômes de « type TDA/H » dans certains troubles du sommeil primaires tels que les troubles respiratoires du sommeil, les mouvements périodiques des membres pendant le sommeil et le syndrome des jambes sans repos. De plus, la somnolence diurne excessive (l’un des symptômes de la narcolepsie et l’hypersomnie idiopathique) peut « mimer » des symptômes de TDA/H. Dès lors, la similitude de certains symptômes peut conduire à des erreurs diagnostiques entre troubles primaires du sommeil et TDA/H. Ainsi, nous nous proposons lors de ce symposium de faire un point sur les liens entre troubles du sommeil et TDA/H chez l’adulte : – en effectuant tout d’abord une revue de la littérature explorant la comorbidité entre ces différents troubles. Puis en présentant ensuite deux études originales sur ce thème en population adulte : – explorant d’une part, la comorbidité des hypersomnies (hypersomnie idiopathique et narcolepsie) chez les adultes TDA/H et la comorbidité TDA/H chez des adultes hypersomniaques ; – d’autre part, en explorant la somnolence diurne excessive objective par un test de maintien de l’éveil en population adulte TDA/H et l’impact de cette somnolence sur les performances de conduite des sujets (sur simulateur de conduite).",

Ils retentissent sur le comportement diurne des enfants et perturbent durablement le sommeil des parents. La clinique du trouble du sommeil eliminera une cause organique (reflux gastro-œsophagien, epilepsie, etc.). Les troubles du sommeil a proprement parler se traduisent par un trouble du rythme circadien, des difficultes d’endormissement et/ou des reveils nocturnes. La prise en charge doit avant tout prendre en compte le contexte environnemental afin d’ameliorer les habitudes et l’hygiene du sommeil et de renforcer les donneurs de temps (alternance lumiere obscurite, alimentation, horaires du coucher et du lever, rythmes sociaux). La severite des troubles et leur retentissement sur le sommeil de toute la famille justifient souvent d’associer un traitement medicamenteux aux mesures comportementales.

      "title": "A Life Setting Conducive to Illness",
      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

      "abstract": "Työn jatkuvaan keskeytymiseen on liitetty kielteisiä vaikutuksia, kuten päätöksenteon vaikeutumista sekä stressin, turhautumisen ja mahdollisesti virheiden lisääntymistä. Tässä tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan, kuinka usein terveyskeskuslääkärin työtehtävät keskeytyvät, miksi ne keskeytyvät ja miten lääkäri reagoi tehtävien keskeytymiseen. Tutkimuksessa havainnoitiin viittä terveyskeskuslääkäriä yhteensä 117 tuntia. Aineistoksi poimittiin kaikki ne tilanteet, joissa lääkärin työtehtävä keskeytyi. Keskeytyksiä löytyi yhteensä 102. Aineisto koodattiin Atlas.ti ohjelmalla ja analyysissä käytettiin sekä laadullisia että määrällisiä menetelmiä. Tulokset osoittavat, että terveyskeskuslääkärin työ keskeytyy noin kerran tunnissa vaihdellen 0.4 keskeytyksestä 1.9 keskeytykseen tunnissa. Kolme neljästä keskeytyksestä johtuu työn organisointitavasta kuten lääkäri-hoitaja työparimallista tai lääkärin tuutorointivastuusta. Loput ovat ennakoimattomia keskeytyksiä kuten tietokoneongelmia. Keskeytykset kumuloituvat niin, että niitä tulee useita peräkkäin tai myös keskeytyksen jälkeen aloitettu uusi tehtävä keskeytyy. Lähes kaikissa tapauksissa lääkäri keskeyttää sen hetkisen tehtävänsä ja siirtyy uuteen työtehtävään. Terveyskeskustyössä keskeytysten ennakoitavuus auttaa sopeutumaan niihin. Kuitenkin lääkärin työssä on myös tehtäviä, kuten vaativien lausuntojen laatiminen, jotka edellyttävät keskeytymätöntä työaikaa. Työhyvinvoinnin näkökulmasta kestävä tapa olisi järjestää lääkärille hiljaista työaikaa tai muuttaa esimerkiksi lausuntoja sellaisiksi, että niihin on mahdollisen keskeytyksenkin jälkeen helppo palata.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The more important part of the assessment of any patient with dizziness or unsteadiness is the clinical history. Symptoms of vertigo, dizziness or unsteadiness can be present in diseases from many organs and systems so the doctor should not automatically equate dizziness with the inner ear. “True” or rotational vertigo implies involvement of the semicircular canals or their central connections, usually the brainstem or cerebellum. However, patients with fainting or syncope syndromes can describe transient rotational feelings as well. It is often the accompanying symptoms and presentation pattern that leads to a diagnosis. Some of the questions doctors should try to answer are: Is this a single, prolonged attack of vertigo, as in vestibular neuritis or brainstem stroke? Is this a recurrent vertiginous syndrome, as in vestibular migraine or Meniere’s disease? Are there any associated migraneous features like in the former or aural symptoms like in the latter? Are the symptoms provoked by lying down/turning over in bed, as in BPPV, or only occur whilst standing up as in postural hypotension? Are there any associated brainstem symptoms as in TIAs or demyelination? Is the patient chronic “dizziness” a progressive gait disorder? Carefully enquiring about the nature of the symptom (vertigo, dizziness, fainting sensation, unsteadiness), presentation (acute, recurrent, chronic, progressive), duration and triggers is vital in reaching a diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "A hiccup is involuntary, paroxysmal inspiratory movements of the chest wall associated with diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscle contractions, with the synchronized closure of glottis. The mechanism underlying this common primitive reflex plays an important role in protecting airways against esophageal aspiration. The hiccup reflex mechanism is based on the afferent pathway (vagus and phrenic nerve and sympathetic fibers innervating chest organs, the abdomen, the ear, the nose and the throat stimulation, and the stimulation of hiccup center in the central nervous system, mainly reflecting psychogenic or metabolic disorders) and the efferent pathway (phrenic nerves). An incidental hiccup is a common problem, usually resolves spontaneously and does not present a clinical issue. The clinical issue arises in the case of pathologic persistent hiccups or symptomatic secondary hiccups which may lead to significant fatigue, insomnia or depression. Generally, pathologic hiccups are associated with considerable discomfort concerning both the \"stigmatized\" person and his or her personal surroundings in which it evokes different emotions, from amusement through impatience to uneasiness and the suggestion of a medical visit as an expression of concern for a given person. The most common causes of pathologic symptomatic hiccups are nervous system diseases, either the central nervous system (proliferative, angiogenic, inflammatory disorders), or the peripheral nervous system: the irritation of the phrenic nerve (proliferative disorders, goitre) and the vagus nerve (otolaryngologic diseases, meningitis, esophageal, stomach and duodenal diseases, hepatitis, pancreatitis, enteritis). The vagus nerve irritation with subsequent hiccups may be caused by chest disorders (injury, surgery) and heart diseases (myocardial infarction). In the present paper we describe the case of a 62-year-old male with recurrent hiccups associated with exertion as a secondary symptom of myocardial ischemia.",

      "abstract": "Hyperkinetic movements are unwanted or excess movements that are frequently seen in children with neurologic disorders. They are an important clinical finding with significant implications for diagnosis and treatment. However, the lack of agreement on standard terminology and definitions interferes with clinical treatment and research. We describe definitions of dystonia, chorea, athetosis, myoclonus, tremor, tics, and stereotypies that arose from a consensus meeting in June 2008 of specialists from different clinical and basic science fields. Dystonia is a movement disorder in which involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both. Chorea is an ongoing random-appearing sequence of one or more discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. Athetosis is a slow, continuous, involuntary writhing movement that prevents maintenance of a stable posture. Myoclonus is a sequence of repeated, often nonrhythmic, brief shock-like jerks due to sudden involuntary contraction or relaxation of one or more muscles. Tremor is a rhythmic back-and-forth or oscillating involuntary movement about a joint axis. Tics are repeated, individually recognizable, intermittent movements or movement fragments that are almost always briefly suppressible and are usually associated with awareness of an urge to perform the movement. Stereotypies are repetitive, simple movements that can be voluntarily suppressed. We provide recommended techniques for clinical examination and suggestions for differentiating between the different types of hyperkinetic movements, noting that there may be overlap between conditions. These definitions and the diagnostic recommendations are intended to be reliable and useful for clinical practice, communication between clinicians and researchers, and for the design of quantitative tests that will guide and assess the outcome of future clinical trials.",

They are associated with a decline in overall health status and perception of poor health and can have negative personal and social consequences. The term insomnia is defined in different ways and can describe a symptom and/or a disorder. It involves dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality and is associated with one or more of the following subjective complaints like difficulty with sleep initiation, difficulty maintaining sleep, or early morning waking with inability to return to sleep. In DSM- V ‘Insomnia Disorder’ is described under the heading of ‘Sleep-Wake Disorders’. It classifies insomnia under an umbrella term “insomnia disorders” where both primary and secondary insomnia are combined. In this paper the new and updated diagnostic criteria of Insomnia Disorder along with its etiology, pathophysiology and consequences will be discussed in detail.",

      "abstract": "Cerebrovascular diseases are socially significant diseases the morbidity and mortality rates of which have increased in recent years, including in working age adults. Due to increased workplace requirements or the nature of the work process, many workers have extended working hours, work overtime, or work in shifts. It impairs their health through a multifaceted mechanism and increases their risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and other diseases. Extended working hours and shift work increase the levels of occupational stress and chronic exposure leads to pathological changes, which may be risk factors for vascular diseases or worsen the control of such. Occupational stressors are a group of various workplace psychological, physical, and organizational failures which, combined with other family or socioeconomic stressors, impair the mental and physical health of the worker. Manual labourers most often exhibit harmful habits and decreased physical activity in their free time, which increases the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease. Overtime and shift work, despite contradictory data, are associated with the emergence of cerebrovascular disease risk factors. Their negative effect is most evident in patients with an already existing illness. Evidence is more definite about the negative effects of night-time work on hypertension, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia. Night shifts disrupt the secretion of melatonin, feeding and circadian rhythm, all of which lead to metabolic changes.",

Underlying mechanisms show that stress is involved in the relationship between sleep and metabolism through hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activation. Sleep deprivation and sleep disorders are associated with maladaptive changes in the HPA axis, leading to neuroendocrine dysregulation. Excess of glucocorticoids increase glucose and insulin and decrease adiponectin levels. Thus, this review provides overall view of the relationship between sleep, stress, and metabolism from basic physiology to pathological conditions, highlighting effective treatments for metabolic disturbances.",

Often this leads to decrements in quality-of-life, cognitive impairment, and increased accidents (2,3). Each year in the United States greater than 50,000motor vehicle accidents are attributed to driving while drowsy (4). Sleepiness has many causes including insufficient sleep, sleep disorders, medical and neurological illness, and medication side effects. This chapter focuses on sleep disorders where excessive sleepiness is the primary symptom; this includes narcolepsy (sporadic and secondary), idiopathic hypersomnia, hypersomnia due to medical conditions (posttraumatic hypersomnia), recurrent hypersomnia, and behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "abstract": "To review current knowledge on blood pressure variability.Blood pressure variability has a time-course ranging from a few seconds or minutes (short-term variability) to 24 h (long-term variability) or 1 year (seasonal variations). The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

Entre esses ultimos, se destacam o zolpidem e a zopiclona, que melhoram significativamente o sono sem alterar sua estrutura ou induzir a uma reincidencia da insonia logo apos uma interrupcao brusca. Alem disso, o desenvolvimento de farmaco-dependencia e de vicio e muito pouco frequente. Primary insomnia is a dyssomnia characterized by a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep and the absence of restorative sleep that lasts for at least 1 month. The polysomnographic test shows alterations in the induction, continuity and structure of sleep. Primary insomnia typically begins in young adulthood, has a chronic course, and it is more prevalent among women. Its prevalence among patients with chronic insomnia ranges from 12.5% to 22.2%. Primary insomnia must be distinguished from insomnia related to inadequate sleep hygiene or another mental disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or a mood disorder. The treatment of primary insomnia consists of nonpharmacological strategies (sleep hygiene, behavior-cognitive therapy) and sleep-promoting medication (e.g. hypnotics). Few differences exist between benzodiazepines, zopiclone and zolpidem in terms of effectiveness in inducing and maintaining sleep. However, in contrast to benzodiazepines, zolpidem and zopiclone do not suppress slow-wave sleep. Rebound insomnia and drug addiction are uncommon. Resumo Summary",

Dentre todos os disturbios do movimento associados a disfuncao dos nucleos da base, a distonia e a menos compreendida em relacao a sua fisiopatologia. Recentestrabalhos revelaram que o circuito motor nucleos da base cortico-estriado-talamocortical apresenta um importante papel nas funcoes cognitivas nao-motoras, particularmente na discriminacao temporal e espacial e na integracao multisensorial. O limiar de discriminacao espacial foi encontrado anormal em pacientes com distonia focal nas maos, distonia cervical e blefaroespasmo. Um fenomeno distinto em distonia e o truque sensorial (ou geste antagonistique). Os truques sensoriais sao geralmentemanobras tateis ou de outra natureza sensorial envolvendo o lado afetado ou nao, que reduzem os movimentos e posturas distonicas. O espasmo hemifacial e uma doenca neurologica com caracteristicas fenomenologicas semelhantes a distonia, porem o espasmo hemifacial e uma forma de mioclonia de origem periferica com contracoesmusculares involuntarias e unilateriais clonicas e tonicas dos musculos inervados pelo nervo facial ipsilateral. Objetivo: verificar a frequencia e a caracterizacao clinica dos truques sensoriais em diferentes tipos de distonia e no espasmo hemifacial, bem como determinar mudancas na sensibilidade espacial durante a realizacao do Grating Orientation Task e correlaciona-las com os truques sensoriais. Amostra e metodos: Osvoluntarios foram recrutados da Clinica Disturbios do Movimento - Ambulatorio Bias Fortes UFMG. Participaram da pesquisa individuos de ambos os sexos, diagnosticados com distonia (exceto a distonia heredo-degenerativa) do tipo blefaroespasmo (n=20), distonia cervical (21) e caibra do escrivao (10) ou espasmo hemifacial (26). Osvoluntarios foram avaliados por uma estudante de mestrado que aplicou um questionario e o Mini Exame do Estado Mental, bem como avaliou a sensibilidade espacial atraves do Grating Orientation Task. Resultados: A presenca do truque sensorial foi maior na distonia cervical (81%) quando comparada ao grupo espasmo hemifacial (38,5%) p= 0,004 e ao grupo câimbra do escrivao (20%), p= 0,001.

      "title": "Editorial: Psychological sleep studies: new insights to support and integrate clinical practice within the healthcare system, volume II",
      "abstract": "Sleep health is essential for overall physical and mental well-being. Insufficient sleep, whether in terms of quantity or quality, significantly impacts an individual's quality of life and day-to-day functioning [1]. Consequences of sleep disorders like insomnia include impaired daytime cognition, reduced work productivity, an increased risk of accidents and injuries, and have been linked to psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and other chronic health conditions. [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].Sleep problems may compromise with the treatments that are currently being administered for a wide range of illnesses. When these disorders are addressed, they have the potential to enhance the patient's quality of life and adherence to therapy, as well as the intensity of the psychological symptoms that they are experiencing. It has been shown that there is a complicated association between sleep and mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress disorders. This interaction is considered to be bidirectional [2], [16], [17]. There is a growing demand in the clinical setting for psychologists who are skilled in evidence-based psychotherapy to become members of multidisciplinary health teams. These psychologists would be tasked with providing cognitive-behavioral intervention and support for patients suffering from insomnia [18], narcolepsy [19], [20], and adherence to treatment for obstructive sleep apnea [21].This volume brings together a collection of research that delves into different aspects of sleep health and its relationship with psychological well-being, offering new approaches to addressing these challenges in various populations. The findings provide critical implications for clinical practice, aiming to improve sleep health management across diverse healthcare settings.Luo et al. [22] investigate the mental health challenges, particularly anxiety and poor sleep, experienced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their study shows that Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) significantly alleviates anxiety and improves sleep quality among practitioners in high-stress environments like mobile cabin hospitals. The intervention demonstrated a reduction in both anxiety and poor sleep indices, offering an accessible and effective solution to mitigate mental health strains during pandemicrelated crises.This study highlights the potential of PMR as a non-invasive, cost-effective intervention that could be readily implemented in healthcare systems to support the mental health of frontline workers. Given the global scale of the healthcare crisis, integrating such tools into standard healthcare practice could enhance workforce wellbeing and performance.In their study, O'Regan et al. [23] explore the patient journey in managing insomnia across Europe and Canada. By mapping the phases of insomnia management, from self-initiated behavioral changes to long-term reliance on prescription medications, the authors reveal a considerable gap in the alignment of healthcare provider strategies and patient needs. Their research uncovers key points where interventions can be improved, particularly in addressing patient expectations and enhancing education around sleep hygiene and nonpharmacological treatments.Overall, the findings show that patient education is crucial to remove the stigma surrounding insomnia, helping patients recognize that chronic insomnia is a primary disorder that requires appropriate medical management, and encouraging them to seek help earlier. Additionally, healthcare provider education and training on sleep disorders are essential to increase the perception of chronic insomnia as a serious primary medical condition and to fully understand its significant impact on patients' daily lives. Furthermore, the current situation, in which many patients must settle for \"manageable\" insomnia, highlights a serious unmet need regarding the management and treatment of this condition. More comprehensive approaches are needed to ensure that patients receive effective care that goes beyond symptom management, addressing the root causes of their insomnia and improving their long-term health outcomes.Wale et al. [24] shed light on the high prevalence of insomnia among university students in Ethiopia. Their study identifies key predictors, including gender, age, mild anxiety symptoms, and excessive use of mobile devices before bedtime, which significantly contribute to poor sleep quality among students. The findings underscore the impact of lifestyle factors and mental health challenges on sleep patterns in young adults, a group particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances due to academic stress and lifestyle transitions.The study calls for targeted interventions focusing on mental health support and promoting better sleep hygiene among university students. Educational institutions should integrate sleep health education into their wellness programs, emphasizing the importance of mental health and limiting late-night screen exposure.Zambelli et al. evaluate the feasibility of delivering CBT-I through telehealth to chronic pain patients suffering from insomnia [25]. The study shows that adapted CBT-I delivered via telehealth not only improved sleep quality but also alleviated symptoms of anxiety, and depression. The research highlights the growing role of telehealth in making effective sleep interventions more accessible, particularly for populations with mobility issues or those living in remote areas.Telehealth-based interventions offer a scalable and practical solution to reach populations with limited access to in-person therapy. As healthcare systems continue to embrace digital health solutions, telehealth-based CBT-I can play a pivotal role in addressing sleep disorders, particularly in the post-pandemic era where telehealth has become more prominent.While the studies presented in this volume offer important insights, several areas remain unexplored, signaling opportunities for future research. First, the long-term effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions like PMR and CBT-I across diverse populations, including adolescents and the elderly, needs further investigation. Additionally, the impact of behavioral and lifestyle factors, such as mobile device use before bedtime, which has been shown to significantly influence sleep quality, particularly among younger populations, requires deeper examination.As telehealth becomes an increasingly central component of healthcare delivery, there is also a need to assess its broader efficacy across varying cultural contexts, socioeconomic groups, and medical conditions.Understanding how digital interventions like telehealth-delivered CBT-I can be optimized to meet the needs of different populations will be crucial for the equitable expansion of these services.The collection of research in this volume underscores the profound interconnectedness of sleep health and psychological well-being. From frontline healthcare workers grappling with anxiety during pandemics to chronic pain patients benefiting from telehealth-delivered CBT-I, these studies highlight the necessity of integrating sleep health into broader mental healthcare strategies. Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, despite their substantial repercussions on both individual and societal health.Psychologists play a crucial role in addressing sleep-related disorders, not only through therapeutic interventions such as CBT-I but also by promoting sleep hygiene and mental wellness as foundational elements of health. Academic training programs in psychology should emphasize the importance of sleep as a pillar of mental well-being, equipping future practitioners with the skills to recognize, address, and treat sleep disturbances as part of a comprehensive mental health approach.To advance a holistic approach, healthcare systems must prioritize early detection and treatment of sleep disorders, leveraging cross-disciplinary methods that integrate mental health, technology, and lifestyle interventions. This volume provides a robust foundation for understanding the significance of sleep in clinical practice, yet ongoing research and innovation will be essential to refine and expand these approaches, fostering a truly integrative model of mental healthcare that includes sleep as a central component.",

The six circadian rhythm sleep disorders include delayed sleep phase type, advanced sleep phase type, non-24-hour sleep/wake syndrome, irregular sleep/wake rhythm, shift work sleep disorder, and jet lag disorder. Zeitgebers such as light are entraining agents of the circadian system and the manipulation of zeitgebers can be used as a therapeutic tool for the circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Measurements of circadian phase can be obtained through various surrogate markers of circadian rhythms, including the core body temperature minimum and the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are commonly under recognized in clinical practice and should be a part of the differential diagnosis of people who present with symptoms of insomnia and daytime sleepiness.",

      "title": "The Effects of Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders on Waking Performance",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSleep is a necessary and reversible behavioural state of perception, cognition, psyche and physical conditions.Abnormal sleep behaviours may include e.g.difficulties in falling asleep, breathing difficulties such as different kinds of apneas, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep onset-REM, leg movements, sleepwalking, sleep talking, tooth grinding and other physical activities.These anomalies involving sleep processes also include sleep itself, dream imagery or muscle weakness.Within sleep there are two separate states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eyes movement (REM).REM sleep is defined by EEG activation, muscle atony, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movement.NREM (non-REM) sleep is subdivided into four stages (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 -Rechtschaffen & Kales) or three stages (N1, N2 and N3 -AASM), which are defined by the electroencephalogram (EEG).The NREM stages are parallel to the depth of sleep continuum (lowest in stage 1 and highest in stage 4 sleep).NREM sleep and REM sleep continue to alternate through the night in cyclically.REM sleep episodes become longer across the night, stages 3 and 4 become shorter across the night.Sleep disorders have an impact on the structure and distribution of sleep.A distinction is important in diagnosis and in the choice of treatments.There are three very important sleep disorders: Insomnia, Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea Syndrome.Altogether, in Western Europe already suffer more than 10 % of the population from Sleep-Awake-Disturbances which has to be treated urgently; 800,000 from Sleep Apnea Syndromes and 25,000 from Narcolepsy (PETER et al. 1995).1. Insomnia is a sleeplessness and includes a decreased total sleep time, a poor sleep efficiency too little and a poor sleep quality caused by one or more of the following: trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep latency), waking up a lot during the night with trouble returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, and/or having unrefreshing sleep/not feeling well rested (even after sleeping 7 to 8 hours at night).Under this criterion the frequency is in the western industrial countries between 20-30 % in which about 10-15 % suffer under a very severe illness and 40 % of all depressions may be preceded by insomnia first.2. Narcolepsy is a genetic disorder and characterized by sleep onset REM sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.www.intechopen.comSleep Disorders 118 The exact prevalence of the general population is unknown.Great differences exist in its appearance frequency.So the frequency of Japan is 0.16 % and of Israel 0.0002 %.Central Europe (0.006 %) and the USA (0.06-0.1 %) are located in the middle.3. Sleep Apnea Syndromes (SAS) are common disorders, which are characterized by repeated oropharyngeal occlusions occurring during the sleep time (sleep-related breathing problems, intermittent hypoxemia) and may be associated with suppression of SWS sleep (disrupted and fragmentized sleep architecture).Due to intermittent hypoxemia and disrupted sleep architecture, SAS leads to impaired daytime functioning in various (neuro)psychological and affective domains and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, principally from adipositas, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.The prevalence of moderate SAS (AHI >15/h) is 9% in male and 4% in female, respectively.25-30 % Sleep Apnea Syndromes were described at patients with hypertension and 35-45 % with patients with on the left heart-failure.The SAS frequency increases with an advancing age and reaches their peak at the age from 50 to 70 years.80% of the patients suffer under excessive daytime sleepiness and a reduced sustained attention.Resulting from this it comes to performance losses both professional and in the ability to drive motor vehicles.Fragmentation of sleep and increased frequency of arousals occur in association with this three disorders and a number of other sleep disorders as well as with medical disorders involving physical pain or discomfort.In this chapter, the author will describe neuropsychological dysfunctions/courses and neuropsychiatric syndromes due sleep disorders which were characterized by 1. excessive daytime sleepiness 2. attention deficit, 3. memory dysfunction, 4. executive dysfunction, 5. driving difficulties, 6. motivation and emotional deficits, 7. psychiatric consequences (e.g.depression, anxiety) and 8. lack of ability to recognize the effects of behaviour.There are wide varieties of difficulties in assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and behavioural disability after sleep disorders.In our studies we used neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric methods in different patient groups in a sleep laboratory.Over the past five years we have been testing and treating more than 2000 patients with different sleep disorders and more than 5000 neurological patients.During admission to the clinic, all patients were selected according to their clinical diagnosis (ICD-10) and were examined neurologically, (neuro)psychologically, psychiatrically and medically.The test persons must not suffer from any severe psychiatric disorders.The study was carried out involving randomly selected patients with sleep disorders.

      "title": "Thermo-parasomnia. Prediction of a possible sleep disorder or entity",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are a group of sleep disorders that are characterized by the presence of undesirable behavioral, experiential, or autonomic nervous system events during sleep initiation, within sleep, or during arousals from any stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. During wakefulness and NREM sleep, the hypothalamus plays a central role in thermoregulation. REM sleep has a very distinct thermoregulatory response that is characterized by an inhibition of hypothalamic control over body temperature, with resulting poikilothermia. The role of the thermoregulatory features of REM sleep is currently unknown. Drawing conclusions from other parasomnias one can assume that a disorder could exist in which the thermoregulatory features of REM sleep are impaired. The existence of this condition may have eluded current research because most of the research on thermoregulation has been completed using animal models or healthy volunteers. If this disorder were to exist, it could be associated with metabolic disorders, or with neurodegenerative conditions, and perhaps it could be an early biomarker for alpha-synucleinopathies in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder. New and evolving wearable technologies offer the promise of facilitating the monitoring of core body temperature and the testing of this hypothesized thermoregulatory autonomic disorder and its clinical correlates.",

Yet, longitudinal investigation of an individual's pattern, regularity, relation to clinical state, and clinical improvement reveals little homogeneity. Morning lows, afternoon slump, evening worsening-all can occur during a single depressive episode. Mood variability, or the propensity to produce mood swings, appears to be the characteristic that most predicts capacity to respond to treatment. Laboratory studies have revealed that mood, like physiological variables such as core body temperature, is regulated by a circadian clock interacting with the sleep homeostat. Many depressed patients, particularly bipolar patients, show delayed sleep phase (late chronotype). Even small shifts in the timing and duration of sleep affect mood state (sleep deprivation and sleep phase advance have an antidepressant effect). The implications for treatment are to stabilize mood state by enhancing synchronization of the sleep-wake cycle with the biological clock (eg, with light therapy).",

      "title": "SPL12 HEAVY PHYSICAL WORK AND FATIGUE IN HEALTHCARE WORKERS",
      "abstract": "Abstract The fatigue that arises from work manifests itself as a feeling of constant fatigue or weakness. It can be physical, mental, or a combination of both. The occurrence of fatigue is influenced by physical, mental and sensory loads, night work, psychological and physical factors of the working environment, personality characteristics of the worker. In order to speak with certainty about the impact of work on humans, one must determine precisely in each particular case what type of work it is. In this sense, the difference is made whether it is static or dynamic work. If the factors such as physical and psychological load act longer than the worker can tolerate, there is a psychophysiological overstretchand a state between normal physiological and pathological with a tendency to pass into the pathological form, i.e. disease. Acute and chronic fatigue of health care workers is very common. Given that every healthcare professional during his working life meets with numerous hazards and dangers, it is very important that they are recognized in a certain way, evaluated / ranked in order to pay special attention to these hazards and dangers that represent a potential threat to the safety and health of health workers. In this context, a study of health workers currently employed in the Kotor Health Center, Emergency Medical Service and Kotor General Hospital was conducted with the aim of establishing the connection between acute and chronic fatigue among medical workers with sociodemographic work and life characteristics of respondents. As for the methods in the process of collecting data from the respondents, two questionnaires were used, which the respondents themselves completed the OFER15 questionnaire and the general questionnaire. Based on the analysis of the data, it can be concluded that recovery, acute and chronic fatigue are significantly higher among the hospital medical workers, which corresponds to the number of working hours that is higher compared to the other population that was examined.",

      "title": "Sleep less and bite more: Sleep disorders associated with occlusal loads during sleep",
      "abstract": "Occlusal overload during sleep is a significant clinical issue that has negative impacts on the maintenance of teeth and the longevity of dental prostheses. Sleep is usually viewed as an 'out-of-functional' mode for masticatory muscles. However, orodental structures and prostheses are not free from occlusal loads during sleep since masticatory muscles can be activated at a low level within normal sleep continuity. Thus, an increase in masticatory muscle contractions, by whatever the cause, can be associated with a risk of increased occlusal loads during sleep. Among such conditions, sleep bruxism (SB) is a type of sleep-related movement disorders with potential load challenge to the tooth and orofacial structures. Patients with SB usually report frequent tooth grinding noises during sleep and there is a consecutive increase in number and strength of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA). Other types of masticatory muscle contractions can be non-specifically activated during sleep, such as brief contractions with tooth tapping, sleep talking, non-rhythmic contractions related to non-specific body movements, etc.; these occur more frequently in sleep disorders. Studies have shown that clinical signs and symptoms of SB can be found in patients with sleep disorders. In addition, sleep becomes compromised with aging process, and a prevalence of most sleep disorders is high in the elderly populations, in which prosthodontic rehabilitations are more required. Therefore, the recognition and understanding of the role of sleep disorders can provide a comprehensive vision for prosthodontic rehabilitations when prosthodontists manage complex orodental cases needing interdisciplinary collaborations between dentistry and sleep medicine.",

      "abstract": "Introdução: A doença de Parkinson (DP) é a causa mais comum de parkinsonismo, síndrome caracterizada por bradicinesia, rigidez muscular e tremor de repouso.Sua prevalência aumentou no último século, sendo a segunda doença neurodegenerativa mais comum.Suas causas ainda não estão estabelecidas, com fatores ambientais e genéticos aparecendo como candidatos potenciais.Seu tratamento está centrado no emprego de fármacos com atividade dopaminérgica, todavia incapazes de modificar o curso da doença.Dentre os distúrbios não motores, destacamos os transtornos cognitivos e de sono, muitas vezes precedendo em anos os sintomas motores.A prevalência de DP-CCL e DDP pode variar de 25% a 80% em ambulatórios especializados.O sono representa a \"suspensão reversível da interação sensório motor com o ambiente, geralmente associada à imobilidade\".Tem sido postulado sua importância para a plasticidade neuronal, consolidação da aprendizagem e clearance de substâncias amiloides, onde a perturbação na quantidade e qualidade do sono, parecem influenciar negativamente a cognição.Objetivo: Investigar se a presença de transtornos do sono estão relacionados à evolução da perda cognitiva e à sobrevida de pacientes com DP após 10 anos.Métodos: Através de um estudo de coorte, foram reavaliados 43 dos 79 indivíduos avaliados na etapa I. Os pacientes foram submetidos a reavaliação cognitiva seguindo os critérios propostos pelo algoritmo nível 2 de Dubois, 2007 e DP-CCL MDS, 2013.Resultados: Na etapa II foram avaliados 55% dos pacientes da etapa I. O tempo médio entre as duas avaliações foi de 105,8 meses.A amostra II foi composta por pacientes mais idosos (p<0.001),com menor escolaridade (p<0.001),usando antidepressivos com maior frequência (p=0.001),com sintomas mais graves (p<0.001),em estágios mais avançados da doença (p<0.001) e com desempenho inferior nos escores totais de MEEM e MDRS.Houve predominância de mulheres e menor escolaridade entre os pacientes que faleceram (X²(1)= 2,88, p = 0,009).O uso de antidepressivos e o tempo de sono REM, na valiação inicial, foi proporcionalmente maior entre os pacientes que sobreviveram (X²(1)= 4,597; p= 0,032).Menor declínio cognitivo mensurado pela MDRS mostrou associação com menor dose diária equivalente de levodopa (ρ=0,604; p<0,001).Maior declínio cognitivo no MEEM foi relacionado a maior sonolência diurna medida pela escala de Epworth (ρ=0,414, p=0,009) e menor proporção de sono N1 (ρ= -0,404, p=0,012).O maior declínio no domínio de memória em MDRS foi relacionado a menor porcentagem de sono total despendido na fase N1 (ρ= -0,364, p= 0,025) e como total de minutos em sono REM (ρ= -0,395, p= 0,25).A sobrevida geral da amostra foi de 79% em 62 meses.Pacientes com DDP tem o risco relativo para óbito aumentado em 4,74 vezes, com homens tendo 73% menor risco relativo de morte.Conclusão: Pacientes com DP apresentam evolução mais favorável quando foram associados a serem mais jovens, ter maior escolaridade, usar doses equivalentes menores de levodopa e ter menos sonolência diurna.",

      "abstract": "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden and unexpected death of an otherwise healthy infant less than 1 year of age where the cause of death remains unexplained after a thorough post-mortem investigation and evaluation of the circumstances. Epidemiological, clinical, biochemical, immunological and pathological evidence indicates that three factors must coincide for SIDS to occur: a vulnerable developmental stage of the immune system and central nervous system in the infant, predisposing factors, and external trigger events. This model is referred to as the fatal triangle or triple risk hypothesis. The concept of a vicious spiral in SIDS, starting with the fatal triangle and ending in death, is proposed as a model to understand the death mechanism. The vicious spiral is initiated by a mucosal infection and immune activation in the upper respiratory and digestive tracts, increased production of cytokines, and an overstimulation of the immature and rapidly developing immune system. A second trigger is the prone sleeping position, which may lead to rebreathing and hypercapnia, in addition to intensify the immune stimulation. In susceptible infants, this induces an aberrant cytokine production that affects sleep regulation, induces hyperthermia, and disrupts arousal mechanisms. In turn, this initiates downregulation of respiration and hypoxemia, which is worsened by nicotine. Inefficient autoresuscitation results in severe hypoxia and accumulation of hypoxic markers which, if not prevented by a normally functioning serotonergic network, contribute to a self-amplifying vicious spiral that eventually leads to coma and death. The purpose of this review is to summarize the research that underpins the concept of the vicious spiral.",

      "title": "Combining Methods of CBT and Progressive Relaxation for Treating Primary Insomnia: A Case Study",
      "abstract": "Primary insomnia is a mental health problem that is often reported due to the combination of either difficulty in falling asleep or maintaining sleep.It is known that people with primary insomnia experience an increased arousal of physiological, cognitive or emotional process, combined with negative conditioning that is associated with sleep.Progressive relaxation is one of the methods known to be effective in minimizing primary insomnia due to the person's need to release their tension.Frequently, the problem that causes primary insomnia derives from anxiety and muscle tension.Further work on the field is needed to show more the effectiveness of progressive relaxation in primary insomnia, especially in Indonesia, due to the lack of papers showing an intervention effect toward mental health problems.This paper presents a single case study of a graduate student who was diagnosed with primary insomnia.Graduate students are more likely to experience sleep deprivation, due to academic pressures and poor sleeping habits.Primary insomnia was diagnosed in this participant because they met the criteria of primary insomnia, such as frequent complaints of inability to fall asleep, and maintaining sleep for at least one month and an impairment in social and occupational functioning.It was shown during counseling that the participant was experiencing distress mainly caused by family problems.The participant felt burdened about the future due to their family's expectations on several subjects such as career, relationships and academic performance.The participant felt the need to fulfill all of the family's requirements.Another intervention, such as the ABC model from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), was needed due to the participant's negative core belief that made them unable to see their own positive traits.The participant also learned a mantra to cancel out unnecessary negative thoughts that caused sleep disturbance.The intervention was conducted for five sessions over a period of three weeks.The participant reported that before she was introduced to progressive relaxation, she had difficulty maintaining her sleep, she woke up five or six times during her sleep, and she was able to sleep only after midnight.After being taught progressive relaxation, the participant reported that her primary insomnia symptoms had decreased.She was able to sleep without any disturbance and fall sleep at 10 p.m.The participant's anxiety toward her family's expectations also decreased markedly.She reported that she was able to focus on what matters in the present, able to distinguish between her own needs and her family's expectations.Mantras were constantly used by the participant even a year after the intervention.She reported that using a mantra was the most efficient way for her to cancel out negative thoughts.This single case study showed that a short-term intervention was capable of providing an effective outcome for an individual with primary insomnia.It was also shown that progressive relaxation was successful in treating primary insomnia.This single case study showed the need to reduce anxiety for people with poor quality of sleep.It is suggested for further study to replicate progressive relaxation for reducing primary insomnia symptoms due to the successful outcome of this single case study.",

      "title": "Insomnia and Daytime Napping in Older Adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and napping are all highly prevalent among the elderly, reflecting changes in sleep architecture, sleep efficiency, sleep quality, and circadian sleep-wake cycles. Insomnia is sometimes associated with subjective daytime sleepiness, as well as other clinical and socioeconomic consequences. The daytime sleepiness will at times lead to napping. Although napping is viewed as a common age-related occurrence, little is known about its benefits or consequences. Factors reported to be contributors to daytime napping include sleep-maintenance difficulty and sleep fragmentation with consequent daytime sleepiness, nighttime use of long-acting sedating agents, daytime use of sedating medications, and dementia. However, a correlation between sleep disturbance and daytime napping has not been consistently observed. Whether napping is beneficial, neutral, or detrimental is an important issue, in light of conflicting findings regarding the impact of daytime napping on nighttime sleep and recent reports of an association between napping and adverse clinical outcomes, including increased mortality risk. Further research is needed to determine whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between napping and insomnia, and between napping and adverse clinical outcomes, and to explore the clinical implications of improving insomnia and reducing daytime napping. Clinical evaluations of hypnotic agents should assess efficacy for both improving insomnia symptoms (particularly sleep-maintenance difficulty, in the case of elderly patients) and reducing daytime sleepiness that would lead to inadvertent napping.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "abstract": "Bruxism is a para-function with tooth clenching and grinding. Particularly, the sleep bruxism is a frequent phenomenon that causes cephalalgia and muscular/joint pains to the awakening, besides an increased dental abrasion and sensibility. The etiology of sleep bruxism is uncertain: while the occlusal discrepancies and the anatomy of the bony structures of the orofacial region play only a minor role, others factors, like smoking, alcohol, drugs, systemic diseases, stress, trauma and heredity, appear to have an important role in the sleep bruxism genesis. Recent polysomnographic studies, suggest that sleep bruxism episodes are part of an sleep arousal response. The sleep arousal response is a sudden change in the depth of sleep. Besides the sleep bruxism appears to be an disturbance in the dopaminergic system. Further psychological factors (like stress, anxiety) are implicated in the aetiology of sleep bruxism as well. The aim of this paper is to review the literature on the aetiology of bruxism.",

      "title": "Chronic insomnia, <scp>REM</scp> sleep instability and emotional dysregulation: A pathway to anxiety and depression?",
      "abstract": "Summary The world‐wide prevalence of insomnia disorder reaches up to 10% of the adult population. Women are more often afflicted than men, and insomnia disorder is a risk factor for somatic and mental illness, especially depression and anxiety disorders. Persistent hyperarousals at the cognitive, emotional, cortical and/or physiological levels are central to most theories regarding the pathophysiology of insomnia. Of the defining features of insomnia disorder, the discrepancy between minor objective polysomnographic alterations of sleep continuity and substantive subjective impairment in insomnia disorder remains enigmatic. Microstructural alterations, especially in rapid eye movement sleep (“rapid eye movement sleep instability”), might explain this mismatch between subjective and objective findings. As rapid eye movement sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep, it might be particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. In consequence, mentation during rapid eye movement sleep may be toned more as conscious‐like wake experience, reflecting pre‐sleep concerns. It is suggested that this instability of rapid eye movement sleep is involved in the mismatch between subjective and objective measures of sleep in insomnia disorder. Furthermore, as rapid eye movement sleep has been linked in previous works to emotional processing, rapid eye movement sleep instability could play a central role in the close association between insomnia and depressive and anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are endogenous 24-hour oscillations in physiology and behaviour that enable organisms to predict and adapt to the rhythmic changes of the day/night cycle. While the rhythm of activity and rest is perhaps the most familiar, changes in body temperature, heart rate, hormone production, and even cognitive function also occur. By contrast, the daily pattern of sleep and wake is not solely determined by the circadian system and is also regulated by a homeostatic process that increases with prolonged waking. Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is commonly observed in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, although it is unclear as to the basis of this comorbidity. The chapter provides an overview of the links between SCRD and schizophrenia, highlighting the potential sources of this association. Moreover, the chapter describes how targeted treatment of the underlying sleep and circadian disruption in this patient group may provide a novel therapeutic avenue to ameliorate their primary symptoms.",

      "title": "Autonomic Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) results not only in motor and sensory deficits but also in autonomic dysfunctions. The disruption of connections between higher brain centers and the spinal cord, or the impaired autonomic nervous system itself, manifests a broad range of autonomic abnormalities. This includes compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, thermoregulatory, and sexual activities. These disabilities evoke potentially life‐threatening symptoms that severely interfere with the daily living of those with SCI. In particular, high thoracic or cervical SCI often causes disordered hemodynamics due to deregulated sympathetic outflow. Episodic hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia develops as a result of massive sympathetic discharge often triggered by unpleasant visceral or sensory stimuli below the injury level. In the pelvic floor, bladder and urethral dysfunctions are classified according to upper motor neuron versus lower motor neuron injuries; this is dependent on the level of lesion. Most impairments of the lower urinary tract manifest in two interrelated complications: bladder storage and emptying. Inadequate or excessive detrusor and sphincter functions as well as detrusor‐sphincter dyssynergia are examples of micturition abnormalities stemming from SCI. Gastrointestinal motility disorders in spinal cord injured‐individuals are comprised of gastric dilation, delayed gastric emptying, and diminished propulsive transit along the entire gastrointestinal tract. As a critical consequence of SCI, neurogenic bowel dysfunction exhibits constipation and/or incontinence. Thus, it is essential to recognize neural mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying various complications of autonomic dysfunctions after SCI. This overview provides both vital information for better understanding these disorders and guides to pursue novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate secondary complications. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

While the prevalence of sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome has a pronounced increase across the lifespan (1-3), the prevalence of psychiatric conditions such as mood and anxiety disorders remains somewhat constant frommiddle to old age (4). Sleep disturbance is a symptom criterion across a number of psychiatric illnesses, including many of the mood and anxiety disorders as delineated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th revision (DSM) (5). Most commonly, the sleep disturbance is in the form of an insomnia complaint and to a lesser extent it relates to hypersomnia and other common disorders of sleep such as sleep apnea. Alterations in sleep architecture are evidenced across a variety of mood and anxiety disorders when sleep is subjected to polysomnographic evaluation. It is also the case that a host of psychotropic medications either alter sleep architecture and/or contribute to subjective sleep complaints.",

      "abstract": "Similarly as nearly all processes taking place continuously in the organism pain shows also frequently a circadian rhythm. In 30 patients with ischalgia pain intensity was studied over 24-hour periods during 7 successive days. The patients noted graphically the intensity of pain on a specially prepared scale. In the light of the data obtained from the patients three types of circadian pain rhythm curves were isolated. In 83,3% of cases the co urse of pain had an evident circadian rhythm returning during successive days. In 19 cases (63.3%) pain was particularly increased in the evening and night hours. In 6 cases (20%) the peak intensity of pain was in the morning hours (5-10 a.m.). In the remaining 5 cases (16%) its intensity was unchanged, without any circadian fluctuations. No relationship was demonstrated between pain rhythm and the age, sex, disease duration, spinal radiological changes, sensory or motor deficit. Pain rhythm is individual feature connected, probably, with other rhythmic processes in the organism, particularly with the rhythm of corticosteroid or endorphin release. Increased intensity of pain may be connected with falling level of these substances in the organism. In 35 patients with a significant nocturnal rhythm of ischalgic pain a trial was undertaken of treating the pain with dexomethasone administered in the evening hours in the painless period. The doses were 1-2 mg. In nearly 70% of cases (24 patients) a good effect of this treatment was obtained. This work based exclusively on clinical observations requires further studies and it is regarded by the authors as a preliminary communication.",

The slow development of hearing loss over time detracts from its being noticed by workers exposed to noise at work, and downplays the immediacy of the problem and the need to address noise issues. The perception that hearing loss is only or primarily due to aging also works to minimize the recognition of noise at work as a real threat to one’s hearing health. Hearing loss affects more than a person’s hearing; it affects an individual’s job performance and the likelihood of accidents at work and home; it has ;,ignificant social and emotional consequences, and affects physical and psychosocial function in the elderly.",

These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep). Consistent with other DSM‐IV diagnostic criteria, both the worry and associated symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment.",

Stress is the disturbance of the complex dynamic equilibrium that all organisms must maintain, and is associated with activation of the Stress system comprising of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the arousal/sympathetic nervous systems. The stress system functions in a baseline circadian fashion and interacts with other systems of the organism to regulate a variety of behavioral, endocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular functions. The experience of perceived or real uncontrollable intense and/or chronic stress (distress) may lead to several psychopathologic conditions, including anxiety, depressive and psychosomatic disorders, substance abuse, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, and osteoporosis, as well as impaired reproductive and immune functions. Developing children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the effects of chronic stress. Both behavioral and biological pathways are involved in the connection between chronic stress and obesity in adults and children. Emotional \"comfort\" eating, lack of sleep, impulsive behaviours and selection of specific foods often characterize stressed individuals. In addition to specific behaviours, dysregulation of the stress system through increased secretion of cortisol and catecholamines, especially in the evening hours, and in concert with concurrently elevated insulin concentrations, leads to development of central obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. In children, chronic alterations in cortisol secretion may have additional effects on cognitive and emotional development, timing of puberty and final stature. Obese children and adolescents are frequently entangled in a vicious cycle between distress, impairing self-image and distorted self-image, maintaining and worsening distress.",

      "title": "1587 Prevention of sleep disorders among shift workers and drivers",
      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> Sleep is a vital function regulated by a circadian rhythm. Its restriction results in daytime sleepiness, which disrupts social life and affects behaviours that have survival value, particularly for occupations requiring a high level of alertness, such as shift workers and drivers. <h3>Methods</h3> Data from published reports and unpublished preliminary results will be used to illustrate the genetics of the sleep/wake cycle and the mechanisms underlying the health consequences of sleep loss. <h3>Result</h3> Shift-work can alter the sleep/wake cycle and the circadian rhythm of biological functions, which results in daytime sleepiness and disruption of social life. About 10% shift workers complain daytime sleepiness or insomnia, impairment in their performance, and cardiovascular, digestive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Polymorphisms in genes expressing the proteins that regulate the circadian functions result in different chronotypes with diverse capability of adapting to shift rotation schedules. Circadian genes also regulate the maintenance of energy balance; sleep loss is a contributor to the development of metabolic disorders, which min turn, are a major risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Day time sleepiness is frequently consequent to OSAS, a major cause of deadly road accidents, and an occupational hazard for drivers of commercial and public transport vehicles and commuters to work, but also for the general public. Early detection of OSAS symptoms shall be part of health surveillance protocols of workers in commercial and public transport trades. <h3>Discussion</h3> Several approaches are suggested to detect and monitor daytime sleepiness and OSAS among shift workers and long haul drivers, including specific questionnaires, and biomonitoring the salivary concentration of melatonin and cortisol level at a specific day time. A carefully designed biomonitoring protocol would help to reduce the health burden of sleep disorders and to save lives.",

      "abstract": "Die Hypersomnie (exzessive Schläfrigkeit) zeichnet sich durch eine erhöhte Schlafneigung aus mit subjektiv vermehrter Tagesschläfrigkeit, ungewollten Nickerchen bis hin zu «Schlafattacken» und/oder verlängertem Nachtschlaf mit morgendlicher Schlaftrunkenheit. Die exzessive Schläfrigkeit sollte gegenüber Müdigkeit und Energielosigkeit, wie sie meist im Zusammenhang mit intern-medizinischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen auftreten, abgegrenzt werden. Die Hypersomnie tritt in der erwachsenen Bevölkerung mit einer Häufigkeit von 2–5% auf und kann zu Arbeitslosigkeit, Unfällen und neuropsychiatrischen Störungen führen. Zu den häufigsten Ursachen einer Hypersomnie zählen das Schlaf-apnoe Syndrom (SAS), die Narkolepsie, das chronische Schlafmanko (sog. Schlafinsuffizienz) sowie das Restless legs-/periodic limb movements in sleep – Syndrom (RLS/PLMS). Die Verdachtsdiagnose ergibt sich oftmals schon aus dem klinischen Beschwerdebild. Dennoch sind eine Polysomnographie und ein Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) für die definitive Diagnosestellung oft notwendig. Therapeutisch stehen die nasale CPAP-Therapie beim SAS, Stimulantien bei der Narkolepsie, eine Verlängerung der Schlafdauer bei der chronischen Schlafinsuffizienz und Dopaminagonisten beim RLS/PLMS zur Wahl.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep medicine is an increasingly important specialty as the adverse health consequences of disturbed sleep are recognised by patients and physicians, and the current classification of sleep disorders, as recognised by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), is summarised. Two primary sleep disorders, narcolepsy with cataplexy and the disorders of arousal, a symptomatic cluster that includes sleepwalking, confusional arousal and sleep terrors, are reviewed in greater detail. Both disorders can be summarised as being caused by inappropriate switching between the states of vigilance, although they are very different in age of onset, severity and impact on health. In narcolepsy the boundary between sleep and wakefulness is uncontrolled but in the disorders of arousal the boundary between states of sleep is affected. These two disorders also have a genetic predisposition suggesting that advances in knowledge of the relevant mutations could eventually translate into better understanding of the possible mechanisms and hence lead to improved treatments. Key Concepts: The disorders of sleep are primary, for example as a result of pathology in the mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness, or secondary, for example resulting from a medical condition. Apnoea, interruptions of breathing lasting longer than 10 s that result in arousal from sleep, is the principal presenting condition at sleep clinics. Polysomnography is used to record physiological parameters such as respiration rate, heart rate and blood oxygen level simultaneously with data allowing the stage of sleep or wakefulness to be defined. Basic research into the neurophysiology, molecular genetics and neurochemistry of sleep and wakefulness has been critical for understanding the causes of many sleep disorders. The classification of sleep disorders is continuously evolving and being refined as new disorders are recognised in the clinic and neurophysiological and neurochemical pathologies are better understood.",

This has potentially serious consequences for the individual, employers, and society as a whole. Apnea refers to short spells when breathing stops. In obstructive sleep apnea, the throat constricts during sleep, preventing breathing; the apnea episode often ends with a loud snore and/or gasp. Such an event is sufficient to open the throat muscles to allow breathing, and the patient usually falls asleep again so quickly that the event is not remembered. This cycle repeats itself throughout the night as the muscles relax and the throat blocks again, and the frequency of the episode is used to determine the severity of the syndrome.",

      "title": "Sleep Physiology, Circadian Rhythms, Waking Performance and the Development of Sleep-Wake Therapeutics",
      "abstract": "Disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle are highly prevalent and diverse. The aetiology of some sleep disorders, such as circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, is understood at the conceptual level of the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep and in part at a mechanistic level. Other disorders such as insomnia are more difficult to relate to sleep regulatory mechanisms or sleep physiology. To further our understanding of sleep-wake disorders and the potential of novel therapeutics, we discuss recent findings on the neurobiology of sleep regulation and circadian rhythmicity and its relation with the subjective experience of sleep and the quality of wakefulness. Sleep continuity and to some extent REM sleep emerge as determinants of subjective sleep quality and waking performance. The effects of insufficient sleep primarily concern subjective and objective sleepiness as well as vigilant attention, whereas performance on higher cognitive functions appears to be better preserved albeit at the cost of increased effort. We discuss age-related, sex and other trait-like differences in sleep physiology and sleep need and compare the effects of existing pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep- and wake-promoting treatments. Successful non-pharmacological approaches such as sleep restriction for insomnia and light and melatonin treatment for circadian rhythm sleep disorders target processes such as sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythmicity. Most pharmacological treatments of sleep disorders target specific signalling pathways with no well-established role in either sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythmicity. Pharmacological sleep therapeutics induce changes in sleep structure and the sleep EEG which are specific to the mechanism of action of the drug. Sleep- and wake-promoting therapeutics often induce residual effects on waking performance and sleep, respectively. The need for novel therapeutic approaches continues not at least because of the societal demand to sleep and be awake out of synchrony with the natural light-dark cycle, the high prevalence of sleep-wake disturbances in mental health disorders and in neurodegeneration. Novel approaches, which will provide a more comprehensive description of sleep and allow for large-scale sleep and circadian physiology studies in the home environment, hold promise for continued improvement of therapeutics for disturbances of sleep, circadian rhythms and waking performance.",

Orexin receptor antagonism, a new sleep-promoting paradigm: an ascending single-dose study with almorexant. Clin Pharmacol Ther, 2010, 87, 593-600. Targeting the Orexin System: A New Approach for Treating Insomnia Sleep is an essential part of our everyday lives that matters more than most people realize. Regulation of the sleep-waking cycle is complex, involving multiple neurological circuits and diverse endogenous molecules. Interplay among assorted neuroanatomical and neurochemical systems maintain the waking state. Sleep-onset is governed by the interacting forces of the sleep drive, which steadily increases with duration of waking and circadian fluctuations. Epidemiological and clinical studies have established that sleep disorders are common and often untreated. Insomnia, one of the most common sleep disorders among adults, is a symptom of difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or non-restorative sleep associated with impaired next-day functioning and an increased risk for accidents. Insomnia treatment continues to be dominated by benzodiazepines and related compounds, which are powerful sedatives that enhance the inhibitory action of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) in the brain. The hypocretins/orexins are recently-discovered peptides with a discrete localization in the lateral hypothalamus. A single gene encodes hypocretin, which is cleaved by proteolytic processing into two smaller peptides: hypocretin-1 (orexin A) and hypocretin-2 (orexin B). These neurons project throughout the entire brain and spinal cord, providing especially heavy innervation to forebrain and brainstem neuronal populations implicated in wakefulness. Hypocretin/orexin has been implicated in narcolepsy, a human sleep disorder. Two orexin receptor subtypes, OX1R and OX2R, have been cloned. They are serpentine G-protein coupled receptors that bind both orexins with low selectivity and are coupled functionally to Ca++ mobilization, probably through transient receptor potential channels. The hypocretin/orexin system plays an important role in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness, especially in the maintenance of long, consolidated awake periods. Increased hypocretin/orexin activity has been observed during waking and at the end of sleep. Almorexant, a tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative, is a reversible, selective, orally active non-selective OX1 and OX2 receptor antagonist that inhibits functional consequences of OX1 and OX2 receptor activation, such as intracellular Ca++ mobilization. Almorexant promotes sleep in a dose-dependent manner in both healthy volunteers and in patients with primary insomnia. In a new single-dose study, Almorexant was administered in an ascending single-dose (1-1,000 mg) to evaluate tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. In this study, subjects showed no decrements on motor function or reactive time on the following day. No evidence of cataplexy or abnormal REM behavior was reported. However, new studies involving night-time administration in relation of Almorexan in patients with sleep disorders are necessary to explore the role of the hypocretin/orexin during the circadian cycle. Modulation of the sleep-wake cycle is very much a question of timing of dosing, so the development of dosage at the optimal time will be essential for this approach. On the other hand, most of the published compounds targeting the hypocretin/orexin system have been developed using radioliganddisplacement assays or simple functional assays (intracellular Ca++ release) in recombinant cells. Hypocretin/orexin signaling cascades operating in the central nervous system will allow the development of more specific assays and generate compounds to block or activate defined branches of the signaling cascades (e.g. MAP kinase cascades), potentially creating drugs with different efficacy profiles.",

      "title": "The Danger of Sleep Deprivation",
      "abstract": "Sleep deprivation is catastrophic to our health, spiking risks for cardiovascular disease, dementia, and diabetes. Yet, a dangerous culture of sleep deprivation thrives in our world. In less than 100 years, we, as a society, have lost more than an hour of sleep, going from 7.9 hours in 1940 to 6.5 today. We may well know how bad sleep deprivation is for us, but science is just starting to figure out why. The hallmark of any psychiatric disorder or neurodegenerative disease is abnormal neurotransmitter signaling. Sleep and circadian timing systems utilize a large number of neurotransmitters, and play a large part in regulating their availability within the body. Therefore, when sleep cycles get out of whack, so do neurotransmitters. Enter a bevy of psychiatric disorders. Patients with diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's tend to simultaneously experience sleep problems, which compounds their disease symptoms, further impairing their cognition and emotions. Yet, interestingly, improvements in sleep quality tend to slow down these diseases. Less sleep also makes us less social creatures. Sleep deprivation affects nearly every system in our bodies. Regularly sleeping less than 6 hours a night greatly reduces your immune systerm, doubles the risk for cancer, and is a major determining factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, substance abuse issues, as well as all major psychiatric conditions. Some studies have shown these levels may return back to normal following a couple of nights of catch-up sleep, but persistent sleeplessness increases the risk of developing full-blown diabetes by about two to three times.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by two or more years of recurrent and intermittent mood episodes in which the individual oscillates or “cycles” between periods of depression and hypomania, with or without normal periods interspersed between the depressive and hypomanic states. Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

      "abstract": "Although the physiological mechanisms that underlie sleep disorders in children differ little from those seen in adults, the clinical manifestations may differ considerably between the two. For example, sleep apnea in adults affects men more than women, is more prevalent in the obese, and presents with symptoms of snoring and excessive somnolence. In preadolescent children, sleep apnea affects both sexes equally, is more closely correlated with adenotonsillar enlargement than obesity, and may be more likely to present with daytime inattention and learning problems rather than frank somnolence. Likewise, the insomnia and associated bedtime struggles of a 3-year-old bear little resemblance to the insomnia of a mature adult apart from the fact that both individuals are unable to easily fall asleep. Sleep disorders in children are reviewed with particular focus on age-related changes in normal sleep and on sleep disorders that primarily or exclusively affect children. Pediatric aspects of other sleep disorders will be reviewed in more limited detail, with examination of how age, developmental level, and comorbid conditions cause clinical presentation and treatment to differ from that of adults.",

      "abstract": "In older persons, sleep complaints in the form of insomnia and daytime drowsiness are highly prevalent and are associated with adverse outcomes. The underlying mechanisms are linked to age-related declines in physiology (normal aging) and age-related increases in disease prevalence (usual aging). This article describes how normal aging leads to less-restorative sleep, characterized by reductions in homeostatic and circadian sleep, and to phase advancement of the sleep-wake cycle, characterized by older persons being more alert in the early morning but drowsier in the early evening. It also describes how usual aging leads to sleep complaints through reductions in health status, loss of physical function, and primary sleep disorders. Psychosocial influences are likewise described, and their relevance to sleep complaints is discussed. These aging-related changes are subsequently incorporated into a conceptual model that describes sleep complaints as a consequence of multiple and interdependent predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors, akin to a geriatric syndrome. The discussion concludes by applying the conceptual model to the sleep-related care of an older person with insomnia and daytime drowsiness and suggesting that the diagnostic assessment consider, in addition to primary sleep disorders, multiple domains, including medical, physical, cognitive, psychological, and social matters, with the intent of developing an overall therapeutic plan and establishing long-term follow-up.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are diseases during which the fine-tuned autoregulation of the brain is lost. Despite the stark contrast in their causal mechanisms, both AD and TBI are conditions which elicit a neuroinflammatory response that is coupled with physical, cognitive, and affective symptoms. One commonly reported symptom in both AD and TBI patients is disturbed sleep. Sleep is regulated by circadian and homeostatic processes, such that pathological inflammation may disrupt the chemical signaling required to maintain a healthy sleep profile. In this way, immune system activation can influence sleep physiology. Conversely, sleep disturbances can exacerbate symptoms or increase the risk of inflammatory/neurodegenerative diseases. Both AD and TBI are worsened by a chronic pro-inflammatory microenvironment which exacerbates symptoms and worsens clinical outcome. Herein, a positive feedback loop of chronic inflammation and sleep disturbances is initiated. In this review, we discuss the bidirectional relationship between sleep disturbances and inflammation, such that chronic inflammation associated with AD and TBI can lead to sleep disturbances and exacerbated neuropathology. We also highlight the role of microglia and cytokines in sleep disturbances associated with these diseases. The proposed sleep and inflammation-mediated link between TBI and AD presents an opportunity for a multifaceted approach to clinical intervention.",

      "title": "Sleep and Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Sleep problems and fatigue are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The etiology of these disturbances is multifactorial. Sleep disturbance and fatigue after TBI can be a result of the trauma itself or can be secondary to medical problems, pain, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and/or side effects of medications. Because sleep disturbance is common in the general population, the clinician needs to differentiate between premorbid sleep problems and those that are temporally related to TBI. The complex relationship between sleep and TBI can be understood as a series of mutually independent processes. First, acute brain injury can lead to disrupted levels of consciousness and a disrupted sleep process. A second and distinct type of sleep disruption often develops in the chronic phase of recovery; during this phase, severity of injury is often another factor that influences the type and nature of sleep problems experienced by patients. Finally, subjective and objective measures of sleep disturbance may be discordant, in that subjective complaints may occur without objective evidence, and vice versa (Orff et al. 2009). The relationship between sleep disturbances and psychiatric disorders is also complex. The neural mechanisms that mediate sleep also have a role in the regulation and stabilization of mood. Dysfunction of these neural circuits after TBI can, therefore, cause both mood and sleep problems. In addition, psychotropics can exacerbate sleep problems, and sleep disturbances can precipitate psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety and dysphoria. Fatigue is a nonspecific and highly subjective symptom that is often reported in patients with TBI. It is described as a feeling of exhaustion, tiredness, or weakness. In many ways, sleep disturbances after TBI are better defined and understood than symptoms of fatigue. Therefore, in this chapter, we first discuss the normal sleep cycle, and then the prevalence, pathophysiology, and types of posttraumatic sleep dis-orders, followed by the evaluation and treatment of these sleep dis-turbances. We then focus on fatigue after TBI. Although sleep disturbances and fatigue overlap, we treat them as separate entities, for clarity. We briefly review the literature and make practical suggestions for the management of sleep and fatigue following TBI. A more detailed description of TBI sleep disturbances can be found in the chapter \"Fatigue and Sleep Problems\" in the Textbook of Traumatic Brain Injury (Rao et al. 2005).",

      "abstract": "The magnitude which sleep has on personal well-being is similar to the effects of diet and exercise. Sleep deprivation has severe negative effects on an individual's overall health, and this is usually overseen. From 30 to 40 % of the population has presented insomnia at a certain moment of life and from 9 to 15 % have evolved into a chronic and severe insomnia. Recent investigations have related sleep deprivation with obesity, metabolic disorders, heart disease, mental health problems and dementia. Recently, more investigations have focused on the multiple alterations suffered by the immune system in cases of sleep deprivation. In order to make an opportune diagnosis of insomnia, it is vital to obtain a detailed history of the patients' sleep habits. In the physical exam one must search for signs and symptoms which might suggest an organic cause that generates the patient's insomnia. One of the pillars in treatment of these patients consists in acquiring an adequate sleep hygiene based on the optimization of the environment and the behavior that are associated with sleep.La magnitud que tiene el sueño en el bienestar integral de una persona es similar a los efectos de la dieta y el ejercicio.

Existen actualmente grupos que se enfocan en las alteraciones en la respuesta inmune que genera la falta de sueño. Para realizar un diagnóstico oportuno de insomnio, es indispensable que durante la consulta se obtenga una historia clínica detallada de los hábitos del sueño. En la exploración física se debe enfatizar la búsqueda de signos y síntomas que sugieran una causa orgánica específica que contribuya a la alteración del sueño.

Bruxism would be caused by central factors (neuropathic or psycho-emotional) involving the central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic (ANS) modulated among other things by sleep and the psychic state. In addition, certain local factors can maintain the parafunction: breathing disorders and sleep parasomnia in particular revealing a pattern of intricate cause-consequences.

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

      "abstract": "Orthostatic tremor is a rare and often neglected diagnosis with a synchronised bilateral high frequency tremor of 13-18 Hz, affecting primarily the legs and trunk muscles while standing. The patient is troubled by an intense feeling of unsteadiness. Tremor and unsteadiness diminish significantly by sitting down or starting to walk. The exact pathophysiology is yet unknown but is considered to involve a disruption in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network supporting balance and adjustements of standing position. The feeling of unsteadiness is probably increased by a proprioceptive disturbance caused by the high frequency tremor.",

      "abstract": "Sex is an important part of life for many people, therefore dealing with erectile problems, living with the effects of physical injury, changes in your appearance or side-effects of treatment can have an enormous impact on your sex life and relationships. Normal sexual behaviour and erectile function depends on a complex interaction between various body-systems, including the brain, nerves, blood-supply and hormones. All of these systems (alone or in combination) may be affected following multiple trauma, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI). For men, trauma may result in problems with achieving or maintaining erections (commonly referred to as erectile dysfunction; ED), problems with ejaculation, or how they think/feel about sex - all of these problems may have an indirect, if not profound impact on long-term functional recovery and overall quality of life. Following multiple trauma, spinal injury, or TBI, it is not unusual for some men to go through a period of reduced sexual drive (reduced libido). Apart from physical effects of injury, the way the body responds sexually also depends on thoughts and feelings – thoughts and feelings about yourself and others may be influenced by changes in mood, motivation, personality and thought-processes. This may be complicated by depression, emotional trauma following the injury, medication, or changes in hormone levels. As some men grapple with the changes and implications associated with their injury, many may initially ignore the importance of sexual difficulties, as they remain focused on physical rehabilitation and recovery of mobility. Other men may be reluctant to acknowledge sexual difficulties, due to cultural or personal reasons. There are a wide range of treatments and interventions that may be helpful for the man and his partner, which is why assessment of sexual function should be routinely incorporated into rehabilitation and follow-up services for trauma-survivors. The information below describes common sexual problems after TBI, SCI or multiple trauma and ways to improve sexual functioning.",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent sleep-related sensorimotor disorder defined by an urge to move the legs in the evening while resting. Severe RLS symptoms can negatively impact sleep, mood, and quality of life. Periodic leg movements during sleep and wakefulness are found in 60% to 80% of patients with RLS. The pathophysiology of RLS and periodic leg movement is still poorly understood and involves brain iron deficiency, dopamine dysregulation, and genetic predisposition. Over the past decades, several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have reported an association between RLS, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension although the magnitude, direction, and underlying mechanisms of these associations remain inconclusive. Periodic leg movements during sleep are concomitant with an increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which may affect the physiological nocturnal blood pressure dip and, therefore, lead to an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Insomnia and sleep deprivation linked to sensory discomfort could also increase the sympathetic tone and contribute to an increase in cardiovascular risk. Comorbidities and associated sleep disorders may also synergically increase cardiovascular risk. This narrative review details the current knowledge of RLS, a still underdiagnosed and poorly recognized disorder, and examines the epidemiological relationship between RLS, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, potential mechanisms underlying this association, and strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with moderate-to-severe RLS. Greater multidisciplinary collaborations between cardiologists and sleep specialists are needed to better identify, understand, and manage patients with sleep disorders, including those with RLS.",

      "abstract": "A person's well-being and health are greatly affected by disorders of sleep and wakefulness. It is of the utmost importance to diagnose and treat such conditions, since the associated daytime sleepiness is a major risk factor for accidents. Early establishment of the correct diagnosis paves the way to achieving an excellent therapeutic outcome. Health-economic requirements of appropriateness and necessity mandate the specific use of cost- and time-intensive examinations in the sleep laboratory. In accordance with the guidelines for \"non-restorative sleep\", severe and chronic sleep disorders can be diagnosed outside the sleep lab if the underlying cause can already be identified on the basis of the patient's history. Such is usually the case in sleep disorders caused by external influences, disturbed circadian rhythm or pre-existing neurological, psychiatric or internal disorders. Standardized questionnaires are used to record and evaluate the patient's complaints, and vigilance testing to assess impaired sustained attention during the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness is quantified by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In the case of some disorders such as apnoea, or periodic leg movements, simplified ambulatory methods have been developed to enable their detection at an early stage. The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep disorders in the sleep lab is cardiorespiratory polysomnography. The relevant biosignals for the assessment of sleep, respiration, heart function, the cardiovascular system and movement are well established. Some of the sensors employed need further improvement. Numerous methods for signal analysis are still undergoing development, and currently available automatic evaluation systems are not yet reliable enough to obviate the need for manual interpretation.",

During the awake interval, the sympathetic nervous system is preeminent but during sleep the renin angiotensin system is the controller. Sleep blood pressure is a more powerful predictor of non‐haemorrhagic cerebro‐ and cardiovascular events in animals and humans, despite the sleep value being lower than the day value. Drugs that act independently of the hormonal or neural systems, such as diuretics and calcium channel blockers, have similar effects during sleep and awake intervals. Beta‐blockers have little effect during sleep when the activity of the sympathetic is low while drugs that interfere with the action of the renin angiotensin system have a greater blood pressure lowering effect during sleep. One aim of therapy should be to ensure that blood pressure is low during sleep and drugs should be used in doses that lower blood pressure throughout the 24 h period.",

      "abstract": "Variables associated with physical activity show circadian rhythms in resting subjects; these rhythms have both exogenous (due to the individual's lifestyle and environment) and endogenous (due to the \"body clock\") components. During exercise, many of the rhythms persist, even though some show decreasing amplitude with increasing severity of exercise. Whilst the value of physical fitness is not disputed (for elite athletes, for individuals who just want to be physically fit, or for patients undertaking physical rehabilitation regimens), there are certain times of the day when special care is needed. These times are soon after waking--when there is the possibility of an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and damage to the spine--and late in the day--when there is an increased risk of respiratory difficulties. Since physical exercise is inextricably linked with thermoregulation, there are special considerations to bear in mind when exercise takes place in cold or hot environments. Further, due to the effects of the body clock, exercise and activity during night work and after time-zone transitions presents problems peculiar to these circumstances. In addition, the menstrual cycle affects physical performance, and these circatrigintan rhythms interact with the circadian ones. Bearing in mind these factors, advice that is based upon knowledge of circadian and circatrigintan rhythms can be given to all those contemplating physical activity. Chronobiologically, there is advantage in undertaking physical activity programmes towards the middle of the waking day and not at times when a sleep or nap has just been taken.",

      "title": "Age Related Changes in Sleep and Circadian Physiology: From Brain Mechanisms to Sleep Behavior",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Sleep and circadian physiology change in healthy older adults independent of medical conditions or medications (1-3). In general, deep nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is reduced, there are more awakenings from sleep, and the time spent awake in bed trying to sleep is increased. Such sleep disruptions are exacerbated by age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease (4), cancer (5,6), nocturia (7), pain (4,8), diabetes (8,9), and depression (10,11). It is estimated that 40% to 70% of older adults experience chronic sleep problems, and that about 50% of the cases are untreated by primary care physicians (12). Sleep problems are even more common in geriatric patients with dementia (13,14). Aging with and without associated medical problems is also associated with changes in the physiology of the internal circadian timekeeping system that regulates near-24-hour rhythms in human physiology and behavior; and age-related changes in circadian physiology are thought to contribute to sleep problems (14-17). This chapter will first review sleep-wakefulness and circadian neurophysiology. Knowledge of the brain regions involved in promoting sleep and wakefulness states can provide perspective on how medications commonly used in the geriatric patient can affect daytime and nighttime function. This discussion will be followed by a review of how sleep and circadian brain regulatory systems change with aging. Knowledge of age-related changes in sleep and circadian systems may promote a better understanding of potential mechanisms underlying sleep problems in the geriatric patient and may help to inform the development of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment strategies.",

To the untutored, sleep is a period of quiescence, rest and stability, when little variation in autonomic control is expected. Yet, in one phase of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (also referred to as desynchronized, paradoxical, or active sleep), a series of changes occurs in the autonomic outflows through a central disruption of those neural mechanisms controlling homeostasis. REM sleep is characterized by muscle atonia, rapid eye movements, and a low-voltage, fast-wave electroencephalogram (EEG).",

Method We examined the relationship between sleep–wake activity, recorded actigraphically over 6 weeks, along with ambient light exposure and simultaneous circadian clock timing, by collecting weekly 48 h profiles of a urinary metabolite of melatonin in 20 out-patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy control individuals matched for age, gender and being unemployed. Results Significant sleep/circadian disruption occurred in all the participants with schizophrenia. Half these individuals showed severe circadian misalignment ranging from phase-advance/delay to non-24 h periods in sleep–wake and melatonin cycles, and the other half showed patterns from excessive sleep to highly irregular and fragmented sleep epochs but with normally timed melatonin production. Conclusions Severe circadian sleep/wake disruptions exist despite stability in mood, mental state and newer antipsychotic treatment.

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are relevant to psychiatric practice in a number of ways, including the possibility that they may be misdiagnosed as fundamentally psychiatric conditions in patients of all ages. This risk exists in a wide range of collectively very common sleep disorders which need to be considered in explaining insomnia, excessive sleepiness or disturbed episodes of behaviour associated with sleep (parasomnias). Examples given include circadian sleep–wake cycle disorders (such as the delayed sleep phase syndrome), obstructive sleep apnoea, narcolepsy, Kleine–Levin syndrome, sleep paralysis and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder. Failure to recognise and treat such disorders is likely to cause and perpetuate psychological problems. Correct recognition requires familiarity with the range and manifestations of sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Stress and Sleep",
      "abstract": "Sleep is an essential component in health and the quality of life of individual. Normally, sleep pattern changes with stress system. Stress is known to be a common cause of short-term insomnia and insomniacs often complain that stress induces sleep problems. Studies suggest that sleep deprivation may activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, one of the main neuroendocrine stress systems. In addition, sleep and wakefulness is regulated by the aminergic, acetylcholinergic brainstem and hypothalamic systems. Classically, activation of the HPA and/or the sympathetic nervous systems results in waking. In human beings or animals, these hormones, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol or corticosterone, noradrenaline, and adrenaline, are associated with attention, vigilance and arousal. An increased awareness of the close interaction between sleep and stress systems is also emerging. The hypothalamus is now recognized as a key center for sleep regulation, with hypothalalmic neurontransmitter systems providing the framework for therapeutic advances. An updated understanding of these systems should allow clinicians and researchers to better understand the effects of drugs, injury and neurologic disease on sleep and wakefulness.

Penyakit yang sering dijumpai pada lansia adalah hipertensi berdampak pada jantung dan stroke. Pengobatan hipertensi berlangsung seumur hidup sehingga harus dikombinasikan dengan pengobatan non farmakologis yaitu relaksasi napas dalam.  Proses menua akan terjadi perubahan-perubahan baik anatomis, biologis, fisiologis maupun psikologis.

Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation.

Insomnia can be transient, short-term, or chronic in its presentation. Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related personal discomfort. Chronic insomnia can be caused by neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders starting or persisting during sleep that hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity. Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation.

This article describes the manifestations, diagnosis, and management of non-REM parasomnias in adults and discusses the social implications of these conditions.Non-REM parasomnias represent a hybrid state of wakefulness and sleep, often triggered by events that increase the frequency of arousals or make it more difficult to fully arouse from sleep. Sleep deprivation, certain medications, and untreated obstructive sleep apnea are known to provoke parasomnias, particularly in those who are genetically predisposed. Non-REM parasomnias include disorders of arousal (ie, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals), sleep-related eating disorder, and exploding head syndrome. Clinical overlap exists between sleep-related eating disorder and disorders of arousal, suggesting that sleep-related eating disorder may be a fourth disorder of arousal or a manifestation of sleepwalking. Exploding head syndrome is a unique parasomnia of uncertain etiology.Non-REM parasomnias can range from minor nuisances to severe, life-altering events. While some patients with non-REM parasomnia experience significant consequences during sleep, wakefulness, or both, non-REM parasomnias do not pose a major risk to most patients. For all patients with non-REM parasomnias, safety should be explicitly discussed and addressed. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be prioritized, as increasing total sleep time, avoiding triggering substances, and treating comorbid sleep disorders is often sufficient for the management of non-REM parasomnias. If symptoms persist despite these interventions, treatment with clonazepam or other medications can be considered.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

At menopause syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric syndrome insomnia occur in 60–80% of cases, significantly affecting the psychological state and quality of women’s life, causing formation of the neurotic, cerebrovascular, cardiac and other diseases. This is largely due to the development of circadian rhythm disorders are closely associated with neuroendocrine factors.Sleep hormone melatonin is a major factor for humoral regulation of sleep-wake cycle, and one of the key factors determining the adaptive capacity of the central nervous system and the whole organism. As a natural chronobiotic synchronizing circadian biorhythms, melatonin provides a normalization of various aspects of the central nervous system, derived from the equilibrium state. In clinical practice this is reflected in the presence of hypnogenic effect of melatonin, which serves as a basis for leading the clinical indications for its use – insomnia of different nature.Melatonin is characterized by the combined chronotropic, anxiolytic, antidepressant and cognitive effects are not peculiar to any other neuro- and psychotropic drugs.In many clinical studies melatonin confirmed the efficacy and safety as a hypnotic, adaptogen and control functions of the central nervous system. Melatonin provides sleep as close to reality as possible. Melatonin is characterized by a high safety level, a complete lack of postsomnic syndrome and psychomotor disorders, as well as the risk of addiction and dependence. In patients with insomnia during treatment with melatonin there were reduction of emotional lability, anxiety, depression, improve mood, increase clarity of consciousness, short-term memory improvement, reducing fatigue, increasing social activity.Among the melatonin preparations present in Ukraine, special attention should be paid for drug vita-melatonin, which fully complies with all international quality standards and the most economically accessible.",

      "title": "Dynamics of recovery sleep from chronic sleep restriction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep loss is common in our 24/7 society with many people routinely sleeping less than they need. Sleep debt is a term describing the difference between the amount of sleep needed, and the amount of sleep obtained. Sleep debt can accumulate over time, resulting in poor cognitive performance, increased sleepiness, poor mood, and a higher risk for accidents. Over the last 30 years, the sleep field has increasingly focused attention on recovery sleep and the ways we can recover from a sleep debt faster and more effectively. While there are still many unanswered questions and debates about the nature of recovery sleep, such as the exact components of sleep important for recovery of function, the amount of sleep needed to recover and the impacts of prior sleep history on recovery, recent research has revealed several important attributes about recovery sleep: (1) the dynamics of the recovery process is impacted by the type of sleep loss (acute versus chronic), (2) mood, sleepiness, and other aspects of cognitive performance recover at different rates, and (3) the recovery process is complex and dependent on the length of recovery sleep and the number of recovery opportunities available. This review will summarize the current state of the literature on recovery sleep, from specific studies of recovery sleep dynamics to napping, “banking” sleep and shiftwork, and will suggest the next steps for research in this field.

      "abstract": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a neurological disorder characterized by the emergence of cognitive impairment after surgery. A growing body of literature suggests that the onset of POCD is closely tied to circadian rhythm disruption (CRD). Circadian rhythms are patterns of behavioral and physiological change that repeat themselves at approximately, but not exactly, every 24 h. They are entrained to the 24 h day by the daily light-dark cycle. Postoperative CRD affects cognitive function likely by disrupting sleep architecture, which in turn provokes a host of pathological processes including neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disturbances, and glymphatic pathway dysfunction. Therefore, to address the pathogenesis of POCD it is first necessary to correct the dysregulated circadian rhythms that often occur in surgical patients. This narrative review summarizes the evidence for CRD as a key contributor to POCD and concludes with a brief discussion of how circadian-effective hospital lighting can be employed to re-entrain stable and robust circadian rhythms in surgical patients.",

There are also several less common presentations of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) that can be found in the elderly, which include complaints of insomnia, nocturnal confusion, and daytime cognitive impairment such as short-term memory loss and poor concentration. As with younger patients, sleep complaints in older patients should be evaluated with a thorough sleep history and often an overnight sleep study. The appropriate diagnosis or identification of specific, often reversible or correctable factors contributing to an elderly patient's sleep complaint can result in significant improvements in quality of life and daytime functioning.",

In the waking state, these muscles generally respond to loud sound (middle ear reflex). Middle ear muscle activity typically erupts before or at the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and persists throughout the REM period in a discontinuous pattern resembling that exhibited by rapid eye movements. Approximately 80 percent of all nocturnal middle ear muscle activity is contained in REM sleep. Half of the remaining 20 percent occurs in the 10-minute intervals just prior to the onset of REM sleep. Middle ear muscle activity is often associated with other phasic events such as momentary enhancement of electromyogram inhibition, apnea, and K complexes. Rapid eye movements and middle ear muscle activity, though significantly correlated in REM sleep, are not always simultaneous.",

      "abstract": "Aging is a normal biological process that entails permanent modifications in the physiological structures and functions of almost all physiological systems. The changes lead to reduced physical and cognitive performance and predisposition to chronic diseases. Cardiovascular aging, with stiffening of the arteries, loss of blood vessel compliance, and a decline in maximal cardiac output, is one of the most obvious changes and it may cause hypertension and cardiac workload increase. The respiratory system is affected by aging causing a loss in the alveolar surface area, decreased elasticity of lung tissues and decreased strength of respiratory muscles hence loss in the efficiency of oxygen exchange. Renal functioning is also impaired and a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) alters the body so that it cannot maintain a normal balance of fluid and electrolytes. The signs of musculoskeletal aging include muscle loss (sarcopenia), reduced bone density (osteopenia or osteoporosis), and loss of joint mobility, which lead to reduced mobility and the risk of fractures. Neurological alterations involve slowing the nerve conduction and lower neurotransmitter levels and mild impairments of the mind, but these are strongly different in different human beings. Endocrine changes include dropped levels of hormone production and sensitivity, e.g., decreased insulin sensitivity (likely to develop diabetes type 2), changes in thyroid activity, and reduced levels of sex hormones (e.g. estrogen and testosterone), affecting metabolism, mood and energy. Immunosenescence of the immune system occurs, which is reduced naïve T-cell production, dysfunction in the response to new antigens, and chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), predisposing to infections and autoimmune diseases. Such physiological changes are regulated by genetics, lifestyles, diet, physical exercises, and exposure to the environment. The mechanisms and the course of such changes are important to understand to provide interventions to improve the quality of life, delay frailty and healthy longevity.",

Although sub-clinical sleep disturbances (insufficient sleep duration or inadequate sleep quality) may be difficult to assess with conceptual and/or methodological clarity, this review attempts to summarize and synthesize these findings. First, the concept of sleep disturbance in a public health context is introduced, to provide context and rationale. Second, operational definitions of 'cardiometabolic disease' and 'sleep disturbance' are offered, to address many unclear operationalizations. Third, the extant literature is summarized regarding short or long sleep duration and/or insufficient sleep, insomnia and insomnia symptoms, general (non-specific sleep disturbances), circadian rhythm abnormalities that result in sleep disturbances, and, briefly, sleep-disordered breathing. Fourth, the review highlights the social/behavioural context of sleep, including discussions of sleep and race/ethnicity, socio-economic position, and other social/environmental factors, in order to place these findings in a social-environmental context relevant to public health. Fifth, the review highlights the issue of sleep as a domain of health behaviour and addresses issues regarding development of healthy sleep interventions.

It has become increasingly clear that sleep does not consist of a homogenous autonomic cardiovascular profile but rather represents a dynamic and organized modulation of neural circulatory control. The spectrum of autonomic regulation during normal sleep includes sympathetic inhibition, bradycardia, and lower blood pressures during synchronized non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, and sympathetic activation with intermittent surges in blood pressure and heart rate during REM sleep. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the normal sleep stage-related changes in sympathetic activity and blood pressure are opposed by chemoreflex-mediated responses to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. These chemoreflex-mediated responses frequently overwhelm the modulatory effects of normal sleep on neural circulatory control.",

      "title": "Deep dyspareunia: a narrative review of impact on sexual function and quality of life",
      "abstract": "Deep dyspareunia refers to pain with deep penetration or insertion into the vagina, which affects quality of life. The aim of this narrative review was to examine how the underlying conditions that give rise to deep dyspareunia, and the symptoms of these conditions, can affect sexual function and quality of life beyond the deep dyspareunia itself. For example, deep dyspareunia may be associated with gynecological pathologies that cause cyclical pain symptoms (e.g. dysmenorrhea, dyschezia/dysuria), resulting in quality of life changes related to menstrual cycle events such as ovulation or menstruation. Recurrent dysmenorrhea can cause hyperalgesic priming that sensitizes the nervous system, leading to chronic pelvic pain that can be exacerbated with sexual activity. The coexistence of functional bowel or bladder disorders can result in urgency and frequency that affect the sexual response cycle. Myofascial/musculoskeletal origins of deep dyspareunia may affect body positioning during sexual activity. Central nervous system sensitization can underlie these different factors, and also be associated with mental health conditions, which together can cause symptomatology across body systems that can affect all aspects of one's sexual life. Recognition and management of the far-reaching impacts of deep dyspareunia and its associated comorbidities may be important in clinical care to meaningfully improve quality of life. Future research should include a comprehensive empirical validation of the hypotheses and potential mechanisms in this review.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is said to be crucial component of human life which plays key role for the maintenance of good health and well-being of the individual. In ayurvedic science ahar,nidra and brahmacharya are named as trayopstambha by which human life is maintained in equilibrium. This further suggests that sleep has its own significance in maintaining harmony among dhosh, dhatu and mala for good health. For the safe guard of mental, physical and social health adequate sleep is must. However, daytime sleeping i.e., diwaswap may be serious concern for good health. It is not that inadequate sleep at night alone, but also excessive daytime sleep i.e., diwaswap with exception of grishma rutu may increase the probability of different metabolic disorders. Various aurveda acharyas have mentioned few symptoms and diseases as the side effect of the diwaswap. It is said to be an abnormality and as such one who sleeps in daytime become more prone of wickedness and elevation of doshas. It seems that agnidhushti and aannavahstrotas dushti are the outcomes of diwaswap, which further leads to various metabolic abnormalities such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular events, mortality, stroke, hyperlipidaemia, myocardial infarcts, mood disorder etc. So, it has been proved that behavioral change in daily routine is needed to overcome these conditions and to improve quality of life. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on role of diwaswap in metabolic disorders and increase awareness of sleep-in health and disease.",

Insomnia disorder may also increase risk for heart disease. There are many things that trigger insomnia like stress, anxiety, alcohol, tobacco, looking at bright screens, working shifts and too much of caffeine. Once these tricks go away, the insomnia may continue and head to insomnia disorder.

      "abstract": "In today's modern society, an increasing number of people have developed sleep-related problems, represented by sleep loss and chronic insomnia. These are due to drastic changes in living conditions such as prolonged work time, increased shift working, and various socio-psychological stresses. Sleep problems have been reported to strongly associate with emotional dysfunction in humans. Sleep loss cause not only daytime sleepiness and psychomotor impairment, but also emotional instability, anxiety and confusion, and chronic insomnia increases vulnerability to mood and anxiety disorders. Recent studies have revealed some of the neural basis of emotional regulation by sleep. For instance, continuous and accumulating sleep debt experienced in daily living could interfere with the functional regulation of the amygdala by ventral anterior cingulate cortex. And consequently this can induce an overreaction of the amygdala to negative emotional stimuli. Sleep-related mood disturbances may, in part, be attributable to the neural basis of emotional instability during sleep debt. In this text, recent findings on the functional linkage between sleep and emotional regulation have been reviewed.",

We investigated prospective associations of circadian disturbances with incident frailty in over 1,000 older adults who had been followed annually for up to 16 years. We found that decreased rhythm strength, reduced stability, or increased variation, were associated with a higher risk of incident frailty, and faster worsening of the overall frailty symptoms over time.

      "title": "Understanding the pathophysiology of insomnia (Anidra) with special reference to primary insomnia using neurotransmitter sleep theories: a narrative review",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a primordial requirement for human sustenance and its role in health is inevitable. Despite its importance, inadequate sleep is one of the most common complaints across the globe. Ayurveda identifies Nidra (sleep) as one of the three supporting pillars of life and attributes its maintenance not only to health but also to longevity and prosperity; in contrast, Anidra (disturbed sleep) is one of the contributing factors for disease. Ayurveda clearly identifies the factors in Anidra which are vitiation of Pitta or Vata (fundamental humors of the body), Manasantapa (psycho-social stress), Kshaya (debilitating factors), or Abhighata (injury/trauma). Insomnia is characterized by reduced quality or quantity of sleep and has effects on the quality of life of the affected individual. It can be the difficulty of sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening, which can have a significant impact on the daily activity of the individual. The contemporary science is yet to give a definite theory for the physiology of sleep and the pathophysiology of insomnia. The most widely accepted and researched concept is the role of neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, melatonin and their effects in the regulation of sleep–wake cycle. These neurotransmitters and their effect on sleep physiology and pathology of insomnia need to be further explored in order to improve its management strategies. Hence, this review aims to determine the possible relation between the concepts of Nidra (sleep) and Anidra (disturbed sleep) mentioned in Ayurveda and these neurotransmitter sleep theories. This will help in improving the understanding of the pathophysiology of insomnia, developing Ayurveda management protocols for insomnia, and also in explaining the pharmacodynamics of Ayurveda drugs better. The method used for review is by sourcing and analyzing the available data from Ayurveda and contemporary literature on the topic in discussion.",

They showed electroencephalographically SWC patterns either in clinical or subclinical ways.2) The type of the occurrence of the SWC in the waking state was divided into the following 3 types.Type I: Its occurrence closely related with the patient's arousal level, and was influenced by external circumstances. In other words, the SWC appearred to be occurred in the relaxation or the state of sleepy tendency of the patient, and its occurrence was often interrupted by the stimuli from the outside.Type II: The SWC patterns occurred rhythmically at a certain intervals, and sometimes concentrated at a certain time of the day. In this type, the occurrence was seemed to be ocrrelated with the daily rhythms of the living body.Type III: No characteristics were seemed in the occurrence of the SWC patterns, in addition its frequency was very high and irregular.Type I mainly correlated with petit mal epilepsy, Type II mainly grand malepilepsy, and Type III patients in whom were seemed the sign of severe organic lesions of the brain.Type II patients had 1-2 peaks of the SWC's occurrence in the morning (within 2-3 hours after awake) or in the evening.And so metimes immediately after this peak, clinical grand mal seizures were observed.3) During the sleep the SWC patterns transformed itself, as reported on petit mal epilepsies by many investigators.The SWC patterns which showed regular rhythmicity in the waking state brake out its regular rhythmicity and shortened its duration and, moreover, its slow component dissapeared and showed only spike components according to the depth of sleep.In a whole night this cyclic change of the SWC patterns was repeated.In the stage of activated sleep the SWC patterns dissapeared, or showed the regular rhythmicity and duration as seen in the day time.Comparing the frequency of the SWC's occurrence during the sleep and the day time, the former was more frequent than the latter.Thus, petit mal and grand mal epilepsy which showed different occurrence of the SWC patterns each other in the waking state showed only this occurrence during the sleeping state4) In 5 cases re-recording were done after 6-21 months.The type of the occurrence of the SWC patterns i n the day time showed no changes if the type of the clinical seizure did not changeThis fact emphasized the correlation between the type of the SWC's occurrence in the day time and the type of clinical seizures5) From the findings mentioned above the neurophysiolosical mechanism related to the centrencephalic seizures was discussed.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYModern life imposes several different labor demands on humanbeings; thus, bringing about stressing situations. All those eventsperceived as threatening bringing about tension are called stressors.A stressing situation comes about when there exists a discrepancybetween environment demands and adequate resources to cope withthem. All these factors lead to physiological, cognitive and motorresponses which enhance perception and create the need of bettersolutions to allow appropriate adaptation behaviors.When stress is present at the workplace in a recurrent fashion, itis known as Labor Stress (LS), an alarming circumstance affectingindividuals and organizations. Main causes of LS are: physicalconditions, schedule, work position, interpersonal relations and otherorganizational variables.Labor Stress is a public health and a labor health problem, for itis related to an increase in labor accident, morbidity and absenteeismrates; thus, generating negative attitudes that yield economic loss toinstitutions.The Burnout Syndrome (BS) is a response to chronically laborstress manifested through emotional exhaustion, depersonalization,as well as hostile and aggressive attitudes toward workmates andservice users, resulting in a feeling of poor personal development.ObjectiveAssess the effect of a psycho-educative intervention to decrease BS inmanaging or directive employees from one sector of CFEGuadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.Materials and methodologyA quasi-experimental study was carried out; this included measure-ments prior and after educative intervention carried out on confidenceemployees from CFE Guadalajara from Februa ry through September2005.The study sample was made up of 29 managing or directiveemployees, conforming four groups; one random-selected groupreceived educative intervention; the other three were control groups;different questionnaires were applied: personal data, psycho-socialfactors and BS through the Maslach Burnout Inventory Scale (MBI).From a participativ e-educational view point, encouraged by thePan-American Health Organization (PHO), the educative interventionsought health promotion through the betterment and consistency ofmental and physical wellbeing.All BS concepts as well as psychological factors were analyzed.Other workshop included the development of preventing, coping andtreatment strategies at individual and social levels. F inally, a correctiveprogram directed to decreasing psychological risk factors in theorganization was encouraged. Also, a post-intervention assessmentwas applied.ResultsSubjects had an average age of 31.5 ± 6.8 years; 52% were females;group 1 decreased for all indicators; emotional exhaustion from 71%to 29%; depersonalization from 43% to 14%; lack of personaldevelopment from 57% to 14%. However, no significant differencewas found in both groups by sex.DiscussionIn personnel with specific responsibilities, obligations, opportunities,challenges and rewards based on their performance work environmentoften drives them to frustration and despair. When the employeebelieves that gives more than he receives, he becomes emotionallyexhausted and more even if he do not have the resources to cope withthe prospect of work. Also, it is documented that at younger age thereis an increased risk of presenting the Burnout.This is because interpersonal relationships are more contentiousbecause of the lack of experience in management. In the seriesreported, on both groups we were not able to document thisrelationship, but still, there is a lack of an international consensus torecognize this as a risk factor.Mingote describes that when the employee has less than fiveyears working, they are often idealistic, utopian dreamers, unlikethose with more than ten years in the job and are in risk of experiencingmonotony at work, loss of interest and the downgrade.Also, this type of workers is subject to overtime. This excessproduces physical and mental stress and leads to lower feelings ofpersonal accomplishment. Even though there could be resourcesfor coping with the monotony at work and that provides resources",

Particularly interesting is the association of seizure propensity and sleep stage, and the fact that seizures are very rare in REM sleep. Furthermore, sleep loss, and sleep disorders may impact epilepsy. Particularly robust is the effect of obstructive sleep apnea, a fairly common sleep disorder. Last but not least, circadian rhythms may have an interesting effect on seizure propensity. Studies in children and in adults indicate that the time when seizures occur may not be random and depends on the epileptogenic region, with frontal lobe seizures being more frequently occurring from sleep and during the early morning hours, and temporal lobe seizures occurring more frequently from wakefulness and in the mid to late afternoon.",

      "abstract": "A widespread network of respiratory-related neurons within the brainstem controls the regular respiratory cycle, which is dependent upon unspecific and specific drives like hypoxia or hypercapnia. This respiratory network and its respiratory drives are subjects to typical changes during the transition from wakefulness to sleep and within the various sleep states, which favor a destabilization of breathing during sleep. There is also a respiratory-related innervation of the dilating and stiffening pharyngeal muscles as well as a local reflex control of the basic tone of upper airway muscles, both of which are influenced by the different states of wakefulness and sleep. These sleep-related changes cause an increase in upper airway resistance during sleep. In healthy subjects, however, these features during sleep are almost completely compensated and the gas exchange is hardly hindered. However, in the case of illness, severe disordered breathing, disturbed gas exchange and interrupted sleep may occur. The central hypoventilation syndrome, central apnea-hypopnea syndromes, as well as the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome belong to these diseases. Because of the intense research, we have a detailed picture of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the origin and the maintenance of sleep-related breathing disorders.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are sleep-related abnormal behaviors. They are frequent and overlooked causes of nocturnal disruptive behavior in the elderly, especially when patients are cognitively impaired. Confusion and violence can result in sleep disruption, injuries for the patients or their bed partners, caregivers distress, and they can be a motive for institutionalization. Parasomnias include the NonREM sleep disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleep-related eating disorder), the REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and more rarely the parasomnia overlap syndrome, which associates both NREM and REM parasomnias. Patients with NREM sleep parasomnias are confused, eyes open, with a glazed look during their nocturnal behaviors, and they have a post-episode amnesia. They shout and bolt from the bed (night terrors), look about in a confused manner, walk and speak (sleepwalking), and eat peculiar or inedible food (sleep-related eating disorders). These behaviors, which are frequent in young adults, may be triggered by short-half live hypnotics in elderly. During the parasomnia, the brain is partially awake (enough to perform complex motor and verbal action), and partially asleep (without conscious awareness or responsibility). RBD is characterized by a loss of the normal muscle atonia that accompanies REM sleep. Patients have excessive motor activity such as punching, kicking, or crying out in association with dream content. RBD are frequent in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and may precede the cognitive or motor symptoms of these diseases by 5 to 10 years. RBD can also be promoted by antidepressants. When combined with thorough clinical interviews, the video-polysomnography is a powerful tool, especially for discriminating the parasomnia from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, sleep apneas and periodic leg movements. Ensuring safety and withdrawing deleterious treatments are useful in patients with violent activities, potential injurious or bothersome to other household members. Clonazepam and melatonin (3-12 mg) are highly effective for treating RBD.",

Nurses working permanent night shifts may have major disturbances in their daytime sleep especially in the duration of sleep which is much less than that of night sleep, and this may be due to attending to essential daytime necessities (e.g. cooking, feeding, shopping and spending time with family). Insomnia was significantly associated with working night shifts among Norwegian nurses [1]. Individual factors that are associated with insomnia among permanent night workers are older age, lower circadian adjustments, being married, having children, physical inactivity and excessive intake of caffeine [2]. Nurses working permanent night shifts frequently lament about problems in commencing and/or sustaining sleep, as well as a decline in sleep duration [3].

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is the main cause of disability among psychiatric disorders worldwide. This surprisingly high burden is related to its high prevalence and its severity. Indeed, depression is often comorbid with somatic as well as psychiatric disorders (particularly suicide, anxiety, and substances), and response to antidepressants is only seen in a minority of patients. Other issues related to the difficulties of treating these patients are the frequency of residual symptoms (mood, fatigue, sleep or appetite disorders) that have been associated with relapses and recurrences. Furthermore, emotional regulation during euthymic periods may be viewed as predictive of subsequent intensity of depressive symptoms. Treatment of depression is a major challenge in daily practice, and researchers need to propose more effective treatments based on innovative approaches. The cyclic nature of depressive illness, the diurnal variations in its symptomatology, and the existence of disturbed sleep-wake and core body temperature rhythms all suggest that dysfunction of the circadian time-keeping system may underlie the pathophysiology of depression. Circadian misalignment of the phase-delayed type appears to be the common shift in unipolar depression and, interestingly, the misalignment between the timing of sleep and the pacemaker is correlated with depressive symptom severity. So, as circadian rhythm disturbances are at the core of depression, their normalizing may be a fruitful avenue for new therapeutic targets in depression.",

      "abstract": "A considerable proportion of patients with cirrhosis exhibit insomnia, delayed sleep habits, and excessive daytime sleepiness. These have been variously attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and impaired hepatic melatonin metabolism, but the understanding of their pathophysiology remains limited and their treatment problematic. Sleep is regulated by the interaction of a homeostatic and a circadian process. The homeostatic process determines sleep propensity in relation to sleep-wake history, thus the need to sleep increases with the duration of the waking period. The circadian process, which is marked by the 24-hour rhythm of the hormone melatonin, is responsible for the alternation of high/low sleep propensity in relation to dark/light cues. Circadian sleep regulation has been studied in some depth in patients with cirrhosis, who show delays in the 24-hour melatonin rhythm, most likely in relation to reduced sensitivity to light cues. However, while melatonin abnormalities are associated with delayed sleep habits, they do not seem to offer a comprehensive explanation to the insomnia exhibited by these patients. Fewer data are available on homeostatic sleep control: it has been recently hypothesized that patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy might be unable, due to excessive daytime sleepiness, to accumulate the need/ability to produce restorative sleep. This review will describe in some detail the features of sleep-wake disturbances in patients with cirrhosis, their mutual relationships, and those, if any, with hepatic failure/hepatic encephalopathy. A separate section will cover the available information on their pathophysiology. Finally, etiological treatment will be briefly discussed.",

      "abstract": "Ventilation is disturbed in sleep even in healthy individuals. In rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) disburbances in ventilation are coupled to phasic events. In 10 normal subjects respiratory frequency was found to be positively correlated and rib cage motion was inversely correlated with eye movement density during REMS. Abdominal motion was little affected, and hence the adverse effects of phasic events on overall ventilation were limited. Ventilation during non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) is characterized by regular periodicities. 'Itro mechanisms are thought to be involved. First, instability of the chemical feedback system caused by high overall loop gain leads to ventilatory oscillations. Second, removal of the wakefulness stimulus leads to reductions in ventilation at sleep onset. It is likely that these two mechanisms interact to produce periodicities in ventilation during early stage 1-2 NREMS. Ventilation is commonly disturbed in sleep. This both occurs in normal individuals, and is particularly severe in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. The mechanisms underlying this are likely to be different in the different stages of sleep. In rapid eye-movement sleep, the disturbances are coupled to the phasic events that occur in this state. One method to measure these phasic events is by recording rapid eye-movements. We have developed a method to examine the interrelationship between ventilation and its components and eye-movements. This method is based on computing separately a running average of ventilation and its components and eye movement density (number of eye movements/second). The window length of the running average, the degree of overlap between adjacent windows and the delay (or lag) between the ventilation and eye movement measures is adjustable. The latter is to allow for asynchrony between the ventilatory changes and the occurrence of eye movements. We have found that a window length of",

The term “SIDS” is used when a sleeping infant, under the age of one year, who has apparently been healthy, is found unexpectedly dead, and forensic evaluation that consists of scene investigation, forensic autopsy and examination of the medical records of the child, is unable to discern a cause of death. Multiple sleep-related mechanisms have been proposed to cause SIDS. These mechanisms include suffocation/asphyxiation in the face-down sleep position, central and/or obstructive sleep apnea, impaired-state-dependent responses to hypoxia and/ or hypercarbia, inadequate autoresuscitation, defective autonomic regulation of blood pressure or thermal responses, and abnormal arousal to life-threatening challenges during sleep. It has been a somewhat controversial term that on one hand has been criticized for not being a proper diagnosis with pathognomonic features, contrasting on the other hand with situations where it has been uncritically and inconsistently applied to all manner of infant deaths. It has been argued that SIDS constitutes a disease with a single cause, an argument which is at odds with those who feel that it is instead a syndrome with common features, and probable heterogeneous and additive risk factors. For this reason it has been called a “diagnosis without a disease”. Despite the shortcomings of forensic medicine, the SIDS story over the past several decades has been one of the great successes in infant healthcare.",

      "abstract": "by evidence of early histological damage, functional alterations, and signs and symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are prominent features of the radiation syndrome. In considering the nature of the altered physiology of the gastrointestinal tract produced by radiation, one is dealing with a very complicated system of the body. Digestion and absorption of food are complex and poorly understood. Symptoms related to the gastrointestinal tract are reflected via a complex system of nervous control through the autonomic sympathetics and parasympathetics. To complicate matters further, the gut has an enteric nervous system of its own which allows for autonomous movements. Gastrointestinal symptoms may stem from diseases of the gastrointestinal tract itself, from diseases of other parts of the body via complex nerve pathways, from impulses arising in the central nervous system, or from a combination of these sources. Gastrointestinal symptoms of central origin are frequent and complex in character. Such complexity is exemplified in the phenomenon of vomiting which may be produced by the sight of blood, extreme fear, or a shocking experience. Other gastrointestinal functional disturbances of a more chronic nature may result from psychic imbalance. It is often difficult to distinguish between organic disease of the gastrointestinal tract and functional disturbances which are purely psychic in origin. In addition, disturbances of central origin are said to be produced by toxins affecting the vomiting and other higher centers. Many acute infectious diseases are ushered in with gastrointestinal symptoms which are believed to be due to central toxic as well as local effects. Disease or trauma of other viscera or parts of the body may produce gastrointestinal symptoms by reflex mechanisms through the central nervous system. Very little is yet known about the part the afferent and efferent nervous elements play in the symptomatology related to radiation injury of the gastrointestinal tract.",

The tendency toward obtaining an inadequate amount of sleep during adolescence has been well documented in the United States, as well as other developed countries. There are basic changes in sleep physiology that begin with the onset of puberty and evolve through adolescence, creating a unique pattern of sleep and wakefulness during the teenage years. These physiological changes result in the timing of optimal teen alertness being out of synchrony with that of younger siblings, parents, and the school schedule.

      "abstract": "Summary In normal trained dogs many trivial factors such as strangers in the laboratory, previous noise and confusion in the kennels, changes in the daily experimental routine, an unexpected change of experimenters, or the presence of a female dog in estrus may cause pronounced emotional disturbances resulting in marked and sudden elevation of blood pressure. The extent of the emotional blood pressure response depends upon the natural emotional reactivity of the animal and the degree of training, being most pronounced in highly trained animals. These factors must be considered in experiments on trained dogs when it is important to avoid emotional tension. It is possible that frequent daily repetitions of these emotional states may over a period of months or years lead to morphological changes in the kidneys and cardiovascular system with persistent elevation of blood pressure. It is reasonable to assume that the high degree of restraint and conditioning which are characteristic of the daily existence of the average human subject may eventually result in a similar state of irritability of the vasomotor centers so that minor changes in the daily routine or environment may lead to repeated and excessive acute blood pressure elevations and over a period of years become a factor in the genesis of certain types of hypertension.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

As the pathology becomes more and more complicated, the psychosocial stresses, mood disturbance, and physiological dysfunction become more significant. Thus, the pathology falls into a vicious circle. Patients with FSS have common problems or characteristics, and have several overlapped diagnoses.

Declining cognitive functioning results in increasing difficulties with occupational and social skills and activities of daily living. A parkinsonian movement disorder characterized by rigidity, slowed movements, the diminution of small motor movements that comprise the natural fluidity of body motion, stooped posture, and a shuffling gait may be seen in dementia with Lewy bodies.

      "abstract": "present conditions of technological development and intensity of urban life, noise is a highly prevalent hazard in occupational and communal environment as it accompanies everyday activities at work, home and even during sleep. The negative impact that noise has on human health depends on the level of acoustic pressure and the duration of exposure, or the „dose of noise” received. The major adverse health effect of noise exposure is thought to be its influence on the function of the hearing organ. A defense mechanism in response to excessive noise is temporary (hearing) threshold shift, which is a transient effect. However, permanent threshold shift, resulting from noise-induced effects within the critical organs of inner and middle ear, is irreversible and corresponds to the hearing loss. The health effects of noise exposure are not limited only to the hearing organ but they may also concern the functions of the cardiovascular, digestive, hormonal and nervous systems as well as the impact on mental health and ageing. Both the large-scale epidemiological studies and case-control studies provide evidence for a significant correlation between noise intensity and the risk of myocardial infarction and arterial hypertension. The findings refer both to communal and occupational noise. According to the state-of-the-art knowledge, such risk of cardiac effects should be considered particularly in individuals exposed to high levels of noise. Recently, some reports have also been published on a possible relationship between noise exposure and type 2 diabetes. It was found that household noise levels > 60 dB were associated with a 22% increase in the risk of diabetes among fa milies dwelling there, compared to lower levels of household noise. The health effects of noise exposure that are not related to hearing tend to be more pronounced in individual s already suffering from hearing impairments and in elderly persons. Exposure to noise was also found to be a risk factor of premature retirement due to the worker’s general health condition.",

Concerting lateral movements, complete paralysis of abduction, adduction (sparing convergence) or ipsilateral laterality is suggestive of damage to the radicular fibres of the abducencs nucleus (VI), to its internuclear neurons or to the nucleus itself respectively. Isolated paralysis of saccades is in favour of a lesion of the paramedian pontine reticular formation. As regards vertical movements, paralysis of the oculomotor nerve (III), either isolated or associated with complete paralysis of the contralateral rectus superior oculi muscle, suggests a lesion of the radicular fibres of III or of the nucleus itself respectively. Paralysis of downward or both downward and upward saccades indicates the presence of bilateral lesions in the region of the mesencephalic reticular formation. Paralysis of upward saccades alone reflects a unilateral lesion located near the posterior commissure.",

      "abstract": "The fatigue in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) appears to be more severe, more functionally impairing, and less likely to be alleviated by rest than fatigue commonly experienced by healthy individuals. The words used by individuals with CFS to describe their fatigue are characterized by terms that deal with functional limitations, frustration, loss of control, permanence, depression, and pervasiveness—language that clearly reflects their diminished quality of life (QOL). With respect to etiology, CFS has been conceptualized among a spectrum of stress-related, functional disorders characterized by profound fatigue and, frequently, pain. In terms of sleep characteristics, individuals with CFS display the characteristic signs of poor overall sleep efficiency that is typically seen in persons with insomnia. They frequently experience nonrestorative sleep, and their daytime functioning is also seriously compromised. QOL scores reflect findings which show that symptoms of CFS significantly undermine many facets of these individuals' lives and significantly impair physical and social functioning as well as participation in activities of daily living. Physicians have little to offer their patients who have CFS. Friends and family, also unable to help, often tell people who have CFS to \"just get on with your life,\" \"pull yourself together,\" and \"stop moping around.\" By dismissing and invalidating the lived experience of individuals with CFS, they contribute to an already poor QOL. Despite recent progress in understanding the biological mechanisms of the illness, more work needs to be done to find effective clinical treatments. Healthcare professionals and disability insurance carriers need to be informed that CFS is a real and disabling physical illness.",

Both those who have directly had a coronavirus infection, and those who have been exposed to stress in conditions of social isolation, deteriorating financial well-being and other changes associated with long-term quarantine. Human existence is subject to biological rhythms, adapting the body to changing environmental conditions. One of the most important regulatory roles is played by circadian (daily) rhythms, namely the cycle of sleep and wakefulness. Pineal hormone - melatonin, is involved in the regulation of pigment metabolism, but its main effect is inhibition of the secretion of gonadotropins. In women, the highest level of melatonin is observed during menstruation, the lowest - during ovulation. This hormone plays an important role in the female reproductive system. In turn, SARS-CoV-2 can cause mental disorders by affecting the central nervous system. The most common symptoms and conditions: headaches and dizziness, taste and smell disorders (hyposmia and anosmia), weakness, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorders, insomnia, impaired attention and concentration. With prolonged illness, serious disorders of the central nervous system are observed. This study aims to correlate changes in sleep quality and changes in menstrual function in patients who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Respiration during wakefulness is influenced by not only automatic control but also voluntary and behavioral control. Sleep is associated with definite changes in respiratory function. With the onset of sleep, voluntary control of ventilation that overrides automatic control during wakefulness becomes terminated. Also ventilatory response to various stimuli including hypoxemia and hypercapnia is decreased. With these reasons respiration during sleep becomes fragile and unstable so that marked hypoxemia can be happened in patients with lung disease especially during REM sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea may also be developed if upper airway resistance is increased in addition to these blunted ventilatory responses.",

Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep and may respond to low doses of antiparkinsonian agents as well as other drugs. Sleep apnea can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness. Evaluation of sleep problems in the elderly includes careful screening for poor sleep habits and other factors that may be contributing to the sleep problem.

Janz studied the relation between seizures and thesleep/wake cycle and divided the epilepsies into three categories: nocturnal,awakening, and diffuse. Since then, the effect of sleep on the ictal andinterictal manifestations of epilepsy has been studied extensively. Manyseizures are activated by sleep or arousal from sleep. Interictal dischargesare also seen more commonly during sleep, with the greatest activation seenduring nonrapid eye movement sleep. Sleep not only increases the frequency ofepileptiform abnormalities, but also may alter their morphology anddistribution. Sleep deprivation also facilitates both epileptiformabnormalities and seizures. Seizures, on the other hand, also impact sleep.Epileptic patients demonstrate multiple sleep abnormalities, including anincreased sleep latency, fragmented sleep, increased awakenings and stageshifts, and an increase in stages 1 and 2 of nonrapid eye movement sleep.These disturbances may in turn be modulated by antiepileptic treatment. Thisreview summarizes the interactions between sleep and epilepsy, including thetiming of seizures during the sleep/wake cycle, the influence of sleep onvarious seizure disorders, the effects of sleep deprivation, and the changesin sleep patterns caused by seizures and theirtreatment.",

SW, CA and ST are different clinical manifestations of the same disorder being ST the most severe and SW the mildest manifestation. Disorders of arousal are typical parasomnias of NREM sleep, mainly slow wave sleep. Pathophysiological mechanism of these disorders is the state's dissociation of wakefulness and sleep. The conjunction of the constitutional factors (genetic, age, sleep privation, drugs, psychological, etc.), and precipitant factors (light, sound, temperature, touch, apnea, gastroesophageal reflux, seizure, fever, psychological, etc.) permit three possible arousal behavioral response: A full awakening, a shift stage of sleep or a partial arousal. Clinical significance of arousal parasomnias depend on the age. In children are caused by developmental and genetic factors and usually are autolimited. In adults usually are caused by psychopathology. In the elderly are often caused by organic brain syndromes. Parasomnias of sleep-wake transition are: Rhythmic movements of sleep, sleeptalking, starts and the nocturnal cramp. Most of them are mild disorders, almost physiological phenomena that usually don't need any treatment.",

      "title": "A study to evaluate psychosocial and physical effects of partial sleep deprivation among post- menopausal women",
      "abstract": "Sleep deprivation is common among post- menopausal women which show multiple effects on social, physical and psychological health. The sleep deprivation and its effects are observed in both working women and homemakers. Insomnia is prevalent in premenopausal, menopausal and post-menopausal women. When insomnia and sleep deprivation becomes chronic, it leads to serious health problems like obstructive sleep apnea. Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea result in daytime sleepiness, attention lapses, fatigue, headaches, hypertension. Post-menopausal women suffer from low self-esteem and are often in highly stressed state of mind, due to physical changes in body like weight gain, dark circles around eyes and hair fall, this in turn has an adverse effect on the quality of their life. Partial sleep deprivation further results in disturbance in the circadian rhythm. Sleep deprivation results in several long term health problems like heart disease, diabetes, malfunctioning of the thyroid gland, stroke, depression, etc. A study by Young et.al on middle aged women showed that severe obstructive sleep apnea was more widespread in postmenopausal women. Sleep deprivation also affects the mental well-being and social behavior of post-menopausal women. In this context, it becomes imperative to create an awareness among post-menopausal women about the necessity of getting good sleep at night to enhance the quality of life and also to improve their health after menopause. This study evaluates and analyses the psychosocial and physical influence caused by sleep deprivation. An attempt is made for a prospective contextual, descriptive research design and study. A convenient sample of post- menopausal women was randomly approached via a questionnaire. Data was analyzed and tabulated.",

      "abstract": "A new tinnitus syndrome is described: high-pitched, cardiac-synchronous tinnitus, whose pulsations are suppressed by strong contractions or compressions of the neck and jaw muscles (somatic testing). 14 cases, 6 non-lateralized and 8 unilateral, are reported. In the non-lateralized cases, onset was bilateral. In the one intermittent case, while her tinnitus was absent her pulsatile tinnitus could be induced by somatic testing. No etiology was found from physical examination, imaging, or ancillary testing. Because these cases of pulsatile tinnitus can be both induced and suppressed by activation of the somatosensory system of the head or upper lateral neck, we propose that this syndrome is occurring from (a) cardiac synchronous somatosensory activation of the central auditory pathway or (b) failure of the somatosensory-auditory central nervous system interactions to suppress cardiac somatosounds.",

      "abstract": "Chronische Erschöpfung lässt sich aufgrund vorliegender Befunde zu konstitutionellen Voraussetzungen, auslösenden und aufrechterhalten Bedingungen als eine funktionelle Störung beschreiben. Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

For couples who want to continue sexual intimacy throughout pregnancy, the physician may recommend positional changes that are more comfortable for the woman and can accommodate the enlarging fetus. Pain, or the anticipation of experiencing pain, may have a negative effect on the woman's interest in sexual intimacy.

Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones. A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ? Existent-t-ils et quelle est la valeur des outils diagnostiques moins contraignants comme par exemple l’agenda de sommeil, l’actimétrie ?

Des alterations rythmiques sont egalement mises en evidence sur des tâches de perception de rythme (i.e., sur des tâches n’impliquant pas de production motrice). Face a l’etendue des dysfonctionnements rythmiques dans la MP, l’hypothese d’une dysrythmie generalisee a ete formulee.

Neanmoins, cette proposition n’a pas ete confirmee a ce jour, et nombre de questions demeurent, tant sur le plan theorique que clinique : les deficits rythmiques caracteristiques de la MP sont-ils reellement lies ? Une source commune aux manifestations rythmiques deficitaires est-elle envisageable ? Si tel est le cas, quels en sont les correlats cerebraux, et les retombees cliniques ? Elaboree autour de deux principaux axes de recherche, cette dissertation avait pour objectif principal de tester l’hypothese d’une dysrythmie generalisee dans la MP, au travers de deux questions : i) existe-t-il des liens entre trois domaines de production rythmique (i.e., coordinations oro-faciale, manuelle, et de marche) et un domaine perceptif dans la MP ?; et ii) quel est l’impact d’un entrainement rythmique d’un domaine moteur (i.e., coordination rythmique manuelle) sur d’autres domaines de coordination motrice (i.e., oro-faciales et de la marche) ? L’ensemble des resultats confirme l’hypothese d’une dysrythmie generalisee dans la MP, et l’existence tres probable d’alterations de mecanismes en lien avec une fonction predictive generale qui, lorsqu’elle est la cible d’un entrainement rythmique, pourrait permettre de reduire certains troubles moteurs dans la MP.",

The onset of depression is influenced by various modifiable and unmodifiable risk factors. Contributing factors may include hormonal changes and feelings of being overwhelmed by childcare responsibilities. Fear of being unable to cope, a low socioeconomic background, and fatigue from frequent sleep disturbances also play a role. Help-seeking behavior depends on the woman’s self-awareness of being unwell. It is influenced by family members’ perceptions of her emotional decline. Beliefs about the illness’s causes, contributing behaviors, and treatment options further impact her behavior. By applying the nursing process, the nurse can identify, intervene, and modify risk factors, thereby preventing or mitigating the severity of perinatal depression and enhancing the well-being of the perinatal woman, her baby, and her family.",

      "abstract": "In the vast majority of patients with parasomnias, the evaluation can be accomplished in the office setting, based on information from the patients themselves and family members or other observers of the nocturnal events. Parasomnias are episodic sleep disorders that include sleepwalking, night terrors, and nightmares. All three conditions are more prevalent in childhood, when developmental factors appear to be responsible for their occurrence; in the much less frequent cases of a delayed onset or persistence in adulthood, psychopathologic states are often primary in their cause. Based on a number of clinical, physiologic, and etiopathogenetic similarities between sleepwalking and night terrors, these two conditions appear to fall along the same pathophysiologic and therefore nosologic continuum. They are both disorders of impaired arousal, characterized by various degrees of confusion, and they occur early in the night when slow-wave sleep predominates, whereas nightmares may occur at any time of the night, because they are closely associated with REM sleep. Another important issue relating to the assessment of parasomnias is to differentiate between nightmares and night terrors: in addition to the different time of night for their occurrence, nightmares are accompanied by much less anxiety, vocalization, motility, and autonomic discharge. Also, nightmare patients usually have vivid and elaborate recall for the event, whereas patients with night terrors are typically amnesic for their episodes, as are patients who sleepwalk. A mainstay in the management of sleepwalking and night terrors is instructing the patients and their family members to provide for adequate safety measures to prevent accidents that may occur during these events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Se debe a la disfunción directa o indirecta de las estructuras del tronco cerebral que regulan el sueño REM, especialmente el núcleo subceruleus. El TCSR puede ser idiopático o asociado a enfermedades neurológicas como la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP), la demencia con cuerpos de Lewy (DCL), la atrofia multisistémica (AMS) y la narcolepsia. Los pacientes con la forma idiopática, especialmente los que tienen alterados el SPECT del transportador de la dopamina, la sonografía de la sustancia negra, los test de olfato y de la visión de colores, tienen un elevado riesgo de desarrollar la E P, DCL y AMS. El TCSR no debe considerarse como un simple trastorno del sueño, sino como una manifestación de una enfermedad neurológica. El clonazepam (0.25-4 mg) y la melatonina (3-12 mg) a la hora de acostarse mejoran los síntomas del TCSR pero no evitan, en la forma idiopática, la conversión a una enfermedad neurodegenerativa. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by dreamenacting behaviors, nightmares and lack of atonia during REM sleep. It is caused by indirect or direct impairment of those structures that regulate REM sleep atonia, particularly the locus subceruleus. RBD may be idiopathic or linked to Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and narcolepsy. Idiopathic RBD patients, especially those with abnormal dopamine transporter uptake imaging, hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra, hyposmia and color vision damage are those with high risk to develop PD, DLB and MSA. RBD may not be considered as a parasomnia but rather as an integral part of a neurodegenerative disease. Clonazepam (0.5-4 mg) and melatonin (3-12 mg) at bed time improve the symptoms of RBD but does not prevent the conversion to a neurodegenerative disease.",

In early neonatal period, sudden unexpected death or sudden unpredictable cardiopulmonary insufficiency or collapse without death has been defined as SUPC (Sudden Unexpected Postnatal Collapse) and it could have serious consequences. It is important to perform a thorough examination for possible causes of ALTE or SUPC. The neonatal period is a time for extrauterine adaptation, during which the newborn should adapt to changes in the environment and is the time for careful observation.",

The myoclonus is present in all sleep states although its frequency is state dependent and greatest during quiet sleep. It is not associated with an arousal response as previously thought.

      "title": "Is ‘Poor Sleep’ Too Vague a Concept for Rational Treatment?",
      "abstract": "Poor sleep is a common complaint, accounting for 4-5% of all general practitioner consultations. Disorders of initiating sleep are overrated by patients compared with disorders of maintaining sleep, despite the greater effect of the latter on daytime performance. There is frequently a discrepancy between subjective observations and objective measurements of sleep. General practitioners should pay attention to sleep disorders lasting more than three weeks and should bear in mind that poor sleep is a symptom, the underlying cause of which needs to be determined. Good coordination of endogenous biorhythms and external life and working circumstances can positively influence sleeping patterns. Sleep onset latency determines the amount of deep sleep and, thus, the duration and stability of core sleep. General practitioners usually prescribe a single type of benzodiazepine drug with a half-life of 5-10 h for sleep disorders. Such drugs cause the patient to fall asleep quickly, to have a considerable period of uninterrupted sleep with little waking and to wake in the morning with a subjective feeling of having slept well. A number of less desirable changes can occur, however, that may produce, for example, anxiety dreams, increased snoring and sleep apnoea periods at night, and weakness of muscles during the day. The third generation of hypnotic agents produce less undesirable changes than the second generation. Zolpidem (an imidazoypridine), one such agent, seems to provide an effective treatment for insomnia without inducing undesirable side-effects.",

      "abstract": "Parental concerns about their young children's sleep are among the most frequent behavior problems discussed with pediatricians. In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child's period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

Most epidemiological studies investigating sleepiness and the behavioral and psychological characteristics of long sleepers have examined the extremes of sleep duration relative to each other. Existing empirically supported models of sleep regulation postulate that duration and timing of sleep are regulated by an interaction between a circadian pacemaker, which programs daily cycles in sleep propensity, and a sleep homeostat, which tracks increases in sleep pressure. Investigations conducted outside the U-shaped pathology lens have also found that long sleepers who do not have insomnia are no sleepier than midrange sleepers.",

Ninety-eight adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder I, II, or not otherwise specified were evaluated. Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that eveningness was associated with greater sleep-wake disturbances, more unhealthy dietary habits, worse quality of life, more impaired interpersonal relationships, and more dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions and behaviors, controlling for age, gender, and years of education. Targeted intervention on dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions and behaviors may reverse eveningness and improve functioning in bipolar disorder.",

Syncope results from an abrupt decrease in cerebral perfusion or essential substrate delivery. It can be difficult to differentiate syncope from seizure activity or, sometimes, episodes of transient weakness. Syncope is often associated with sudden exertion or excitement. Limb stiffening, opisthotonic posture, micturition, and vocalization are common. Syncope occurs when cerebral blood flow falls below a critical level; this is about 30–50% of normal in people, although it might differ for quadripeds. Reduced cerebral blood flow also can result from cerebrovascular or other intracranial disease. Cardiac arrhythmias, as well as organic heart disease, commonly are involved. Quadrupedal posture makes this less likely in companion animals, although it does seem that sudden excitement might precipitate this in dogs. Arrhythmic causes of syncope can occur during sleep such that a loss of consciousness might not be observed, but might result in seizure-like activity, opisthotonus, urination.",

An estimated 82% of men and 92% of women with moderate to severe OSA have not been diagnosed [3]. Sleep apnea events are defi ned as a complete cessation of breathing (apnea) or a marked reduction in airfl ow (hypopnea) during sleep, and are considered clinically relevant if they last more than 10 seconds. The episodes of apneas and hypopneas may persist for 30 to 60 seconds in some individuals. OSA is characterized by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway, often resulting in oxygen desaturation and arousals from sleep. The classic daytime manifestation is excessive sleepiness, and other symptoms such as non-refreshing sleep, poor concentration, and fatigue are commonly reported [4]. OSA is a serious condition that diminishes the quality of life [5] and is also associated with many common comorbidities. Studies have documented an increased incidence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents, and gastroesophageal refl ux disease in OSA patients [6,7]. It is estimated that the average life span of an untreated OSA patient is 58 years, much shorter than the average life spans of 78 years for men and 83 years for women [8].

      "abstract": "The obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) includes a constellation of symptoms, most prominently excessive daytime somnolence and unrefreshing sleep, associated with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The periodic respiratory events constituting SDB may be complete cessation of airflow (apneas), reductions in airflow of various degree (hypopneas), increased respiratory \"effort\" events with no increase in airflow (flow limitation events), or a combination of these events occurring at various times during the sleep period. Unrefreshing sleep and excessive daytime somnolence are thought to be because of disruption of the normal sleep architecture from recurrent brief arousals associated with the respiratory events, usually resulting in reduced \"deep\" (slow wave) and rapid eye movement sleep. Oxyhemoglobin desaturation, often severe, usually accompanies the respiratory events and may be a major factor in the cardiovascular morbidity associated with OSAHS. However, this satisfyingly simple and logical construct for OSHAS is likely an oversimplification. The lack of universally accepted criteria for defining a specific disease entity and the lack of certainty about the causal relationship of the various types of respiratory events and associated arousals/desaturations with symptoms and the pathophysiological consequences, limit the understanding of the prevalence, risk factors, and natural history of clinically important SDB.",

      "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue: Sleep in Children with Neurodevelopmental and Psychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "For those clinicians and researchers who have chosen and embraced the challenges and rewards of working on a daily basis with children and families, the concept of ‘‘developmental context’’ is hardly a revelation. As with virtually any issue that pediatric practitioners confront in clinical settings or investigators examine in experimental settings or epidemiologic studies, sleep problems in childhood must be viewed in the context of normal physical and cognitive/emotional phenomena that are occurring at different developmental stages. For example, temporary regressions in sleep development often accompany the achievement of motor and cognitive milestones in the first year of life. Similarly, an increase in nighttime fears and night wakings in toddlers may be a temporary manifestation of developmentally normal separation anxiety peaking during that stage. In addition, sleep problems in the pediatric population must be viewed against a backdrop of the normal developmental trajectory across childhood and developmental norms; i.e., ‘‘normal’’ bedtime behavior, time to sleep onset, and sleep duration are obviously dramatically different in a 6-month old, 6-year old, and 16-year old. Finally, because the developmental continuum includes the transition into adulthood, insights into the prevalence, types, and impact of, as well as risk and protective factors for, sleep problems in childhood have direct relevance in regards to an increased understanding of sleep issues at all life stages. Despite the obvious importance of viewing sleep problems in both children and adults from a developmental perspective, the body of literature in developmental aspects of pediatric sleep research at this juncture is still relatively sparse. For example, there are surprisingly little large-scale epidemiological data currently available, which systematically define normal sleep and wakefulness patterns and sleep duration in the pediatric population. Most of the existing studies have utilized subjective, parentreport, retrospective, cross-sectional surveys in selected populations. Although cross-sectional studies yield important information regarding sleep in discrete age groups, by their nature they neither describe the evolution and persistence of sleep/wake patterns over time, nor do they help to elucidate the complex reciprocal relationship between sleep and cognitive/emotional development from the prenatal period through adolescence. There are even more limited data from studies utilizing more ‘‘objective’’ methods of measuring sleep quality and duration, such as polysomnography and actigraphy; and many of these studies were conducted prior to the establishment of accepted sleep monitoring and scoring standards. There are many potential reasons for this relative knowledge gap. First, as with many behavioral issues in childhood, the patient is rarely the one who presents with a chief complaint of a sleep problem. Thus, parental concerns and subjective observations regarding their child’s sleep patterns and behaviors often define sleep disturbances in the research, as well as in the clinical context. Parental recognition and reporting of sleep problems in children also varies across childhood, with parents of infants and toddlers more likely to be aware of sleep concerns than those of school-aged children and adolescents (and to report them to clinicians and researchers). Furthermore, the very definition of what behaviors constitute a sleep ‘‘problem’’ is often highly subjective and is frequently determined by the amount of disruption caused to parents’ sleep. Culturally based values and beliefs regarding the meaning, importance, and role of sleep in daily life, as well as culturally based differences in sleep practices (e.g., sleeping space and environment, solitary sleep vs. co-sleeping, use of transitional objects) also have a profound effect on how a parent",

Stress can be identified as the process in the body for adapting to influences, changes, demands, and strains to which it is exposed. Stress caused by a working environment is known as occupational stress and globally considered to be among the topmost serious health issues. Stress and burnout have reached all-time highs across various professions as stressors have become assiduous and indeterminate - employers and employees alike are scrambling to return to normalcy in the working environment. Burnout results from the physical, mental, and psychological reactions from experiencing prolonged stress. Burnout, considered an occupational phenomenon rather than a medical condition, is often exacerbated with depression and anxiety leading to concerns of employee well-being and mental health. The progressive escalation of occupational stress and burnout has gained attention from global organizations and as the nature of work continues to evolve, understanding occupational stress can support initiatives for managing it.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

      "abstract": "Slaapdeprivatie en obesitas zijn grote publieke gezondheidsproblemen met grote sociale-, persoonlijke- en gezondheidszorgkosten en problemen. Slaapdeprivatie is geassocieerd met obesitas in vele epidemiologische studies. De prevalentie van obesitas neemt toe en de gemiddelde slaapduur neemt af, maar waar deze correlatie vandaan komt en welk causaal mechanisme hiervoor verantwoordelijk is is nog niet vastgesteld. De vraag die in deze scriptie beantwoord zal worden is wat de invloed is van slaapdeprivatie op voedselinname en obesitas en welk causaal mechanisme hieraan ten grondslag ligt. \r\n\r\nSlaapdeprivatie is een toestand waarin men onvoldoende, 5 uur in 24 uur, slaap krijgt, dit leidt tot een homeostatisch stressvolle situatie waardoor het lichaam meer energie wil opslaan om hierop te kunnen anticiperen. In onze huidige maatschappij is er altijd meer dan voldoende voedsel aanwezig wat ertoe leidt dat een dergelijke situatie leidt tot gewichtstoename. De prefrontale cortex, thalamus, parietale kwab en het limbische systeem laten verhoogde activiteit zien bij slaapdeprivatie, wat ertoe kan leiden dat men humeuriger wordt, de cognitieve - en motorische prestaties achteruit gaan en de remming op gedragingen verminderd wordt. Slaapdeprivatie leidt tot verhoogd energieverbruik (90 kcal) door additionele waaktijd en verhoogde energie inname (300-550 kcal) door verhoogde inname van snacks laat op de avond, wat een positieve energiebalans als gevolg heeft. De voedingsmiddelen die geconsumeerd worden bevatten meer vet, koolhydraten en zijn energierijker en verhoogde inname hiervan zal uiteindelijk leiden tot gewichtstoename. Wanneer er onderzocht wordt wat de causaliteit is van deze observeringen wordt er geen netto effect gezien van de hormonen ghreline en leptine, en het effect van GLP-1 is sekse afhankelijk. Slaapdeprivatie induceert verhoogde activiteit in hersengebieden verantwoordelijk voor plezier, beloning, motivatie en salience. Met name de insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal prefrontale cortex en de OFC zijn geactiveerd, waarbij er verhoogde connectiviteit is gezien tussen de dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, de insula en het putamen. \r\n\r\nDoor slaapdeprivatie worden gebieden in de hersenen geactiveerd, dit wordt geinduceerd vanuit de hypothalamus naar hersengebieden verantwoordelijk voor genot, beloning en motivatie. Deze activatie leidt tot een grotere salience en verhoogde beloning van ongezonde voeding, waardoor men deze voedingsmiddelen meer gaat consumeren als reactie op slaapdeprivatie wat op den duur zal leiden tot gewichtstoename en obesitas.",

To get around this impasse, we propose to consider school not only as the place of learning, or a place that symbolizes separation from the mother, but also as an external synchronizer of rhythmic patterns. Through a clinical case, we explore the autistic register of functioning that unfolds in an adolescent when confronted with the issue of school. We hypothesize that repeated failures in rhythmic harmonization, due to early microtraumas that prevented a rhythm of security from being established in the primary relationship, maintain an autistic stratum of the psyche, which is set on a mechanical rhythm. The upheavals due to puberty, by modifying the relationship to time that has been constructed from the interweaving of rhythms, rekindle early dysrhythmic traumas. A discontinuity or break in external synchronization (school holidays, sick leave, etc.) can then trigger the outbreak of disorders. The co-creation of a reassuring rhythmic envelope will therefore constitute both a prerequisite for and the beginning of the therapeutic bond.",

      "title": "Does the Patient Have Abnormal Movements at Night?",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders are generally characterized by simple movements that disturb sleep or the ability to fall asleep. These disorders manifest symptoms of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness or tiredness. In order to make an accurate diagnosis, an all-night video recording is desired to differentiate these disorders from parasomnias. Sleep-related movement disorders or congenital simple movements can cause disturbed sleep. All-night recordings are recommended to differentiate the sleep-related movement disorder from parasomnias. Patients are usually unaware of movements or sleep disturbance. Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders are repetitive and stereotyped with rhythmic motor behaviors. These movements occur during drowsiness or early sleep and involve large muscle groups and include body rocking, head rolling, or head banging. They are more common in children and infants. In most situations, they do not have any significant consequences. Many sleep-related movement disorders are a result of a medical condition due to side effects or withdrawal from medication or a substance, or they could be an isolated symptom or normal variant. Many of these disorders of movement tend to overlap with other sleep conditions including parasomnias. In general, parasomnias are undesirable physical events that occur when falling asleep, during sleep, or while waking up. They include abnormal sleep-related complex movements, behaviors, and autonomic nervous system activity. They significantly contrast with sleep-related movement disorders. Parasomnias tend to result in injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Sometimes they affect the patient, the bed partner, or both. Non-REM-related parasomnias include confused arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Patients tend to have a partial or complete amnesia for episodes. REM-related parasomnias include a REM behavior disorder also known as RBD. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged to elderly males. However, it is often associated with an underlying neurologic disorder such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, narcolepsy, cerebrovascular accident, or Lewy body dementia. Nightmare disorder is apparent during rapid eye movement sleep and often leads to awakening with a bowel movement. While prevalent in the general population, this is common in children. Nightmares are frequently associated with psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder. The patient remembers the dreams and can describe the nightmare, which usually involves threats to survival, security, or physical activity. Nightmares can have a negative impact on family functioning and lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or low energy. It can also impair occupational or educational functions.",

      "abstract": "Central sleep apnea (CSA) is characterized by recurrent apneic episodes with absent respiratory effort. This is not a common clinical condition like obstructive sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea is diagnosed when more than 50% of the events are central types. Cheyne–Stokes respiration (CSR) is a breathing pattern characterized by cycles of crescendo-decrescendo changes in tidal volume followed by central sleep apneas. These changes are associated with fluctuations in hemodynamic, respiratory, neurologic, and acid-base parameters. Historical and current theories of causation strongly implicate an alteration of central respiratory control as the most key factor in the genesis of periodic respiration. Tissue perfusion and metabolically determined changes in acid-base balance have dominant roles in the production of CSR. At least ten consecutive minutes of these cycles should be recorded before CSR can be diagnosed. The ICSD-3 specifies that at least ten central apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep should occur, accompanied by arousals and derangement of sleep structure. Other types of central sleep apnea are also important and have been discussed in this chapter by the authors. The management also differs from the underlying cause, which is clearly emphasized. The controversy about ASV versus other forms of PAP therapy in the management of CSA is delineated. This chapter discusses a range of interventions in the management of CSA, from acetazolamide and overdrive atrial pacing to the placement of implantable remedē systems.",

      "abstract": "Sleep Paralysis (SP) is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon situated at the intersection of neurobiology, psychiatry, genetics, and cultural belief systems. This study offers a comprehensive investigation into SP, integrating findings from neurophysiological, psychological, and sociocultural domains. Neurobiological evidence highlights disruptions during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep cycle—specifically the persistence of REM atonia into wakefulness—as a core mechanism underlying SP, often accompanied by vivid hallucinations and sensory distortions. Psychiatric analyses reveal a strong association between SP and mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, underscoring the influence of emotional trauma on REM regulation. Genetic studies indicate that polymorphisms in circadian rhythm-related genes (e.g., PER, CLOCK, ARNTL2), calcium channel genes (e.g., CACNA1C), and recently, the anti-aging gene Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), may contribute to SP susceptibility through their regulation of sleep-wake cycles and stress responses. Cultural frameworks further shape SP experiences, with interpretations ranging from demonic visitations to ancestral contact, influencing both coping strategies and emotional outcomes. In response to these findings, this paper advocates for a culturally sensitive, biopsychosocial model for SP treatment—one that integrates trauma-informed therapy, genetic profiling, and community-based education. It concludes that SP is not merely a sleep disturbance but a deeply subjective and neurogenetically influenced experience, requiring interdisciplinary approaches for effective understanding and intervention. Future directions include exploring pharmacogenomics, real-time neuroimaging during SP episodes, and culturally informed VR therapies to bridge clinical practice with individual lived experience.",

      "title": "Depresija kao javnozdravstveni problem",
      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

      "title": "RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP QUALITY, BODY PERCEPTION AND MOTOR AND SENSORY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is an autoimmune neurological disease, where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of the central nervous system, causing inflammation that impairs the transmission of nerve impulses. It is characterized by episodes of flare-ups with exacerbation of symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness in the lower and upper limbs, tremors and balance, difficulty walking, loss of vision, among others, followed by remissions with partial or complete recovery, which can last for months or years, during which the progression of the disease is minimal or absent. Insomnia or poor sleep quality can occur indirectly as a consequence of RRMS. That is, a secondary symptom that is caused by the presence of the specific symptoms of the disease and pseudo-outbreaks. Body Perception (PC) can be defined in two ways, such as Body Image (CI) and Body Schema (CE). HF is related to the psychic, emotional, cognitive, sociocultural, evolutionary, genetic and neuroscientific aspects, in relation to the expectation of the image of their body. The CS is the perspective that enables, through kinesthetic and proprioceptive mechanisms, the recognition of the anatomical body and the relationship it establishes with the environment and with the objects around it. In view of these definitions, the opportunity arose to relate sleep quality with body perception and symptomatological conditions. Thus, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between sleep quality and body perception, by the aspect of body schema and the symptomatological conditions of multiple sclerosis. Participants were 18 people, aged between 21 and 67 years, who were evaluated for sleep quality using the Pittsburgh questionnaire, body perception using the Askevold test, and symptoms through a structured interview. The results indicated that all participants with adequate sleep were classified as hyperschematic, while 67% of those who had inadequate sleep were classified as hyposchematic. In addition, individuals with inadequate sleep showed a balanced distribution between motor and sensory symptoms, while those with adequate sleep predominantly reported sensory symptoms. Fatigue was a relevant symptom in 67% of individuals with inadequate sleep. These findings suggest that sleep quality may be associated with body perception and symptom manifestation in RRMS, highlighting the importance of sleep-enhancing interventions for the management of this condition.",

In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

Sleep disorder has very important effects on fatigue resolve, growth, endocrine, immune, cardiopulmonary, metabolic function, general health and eventually life-span. Prevalence of insomnia in elderly revealed as persistent insomnia in 10–15% and sleep disorder in 40–70%, which is basically accompanied with decreasing melatonin secretion as a person ages. Urological diseases related with sleep disorder are nocturia, overactive bladder, benign prostate hyperplasia, bladder & prostate cancer, cystitis, prostatitis, neurogenic bladder, urethral stricture, nocturnal polyuria, late onset hypogonadism, et cetera. Of these disorders, nocturia is one of the most bothersome self-reported insomnia in the elderly which is associated with poor quality of life. Voiding and sleep patterns should be strictly evaluated in elderly patients to define which of urological disease or sleep disorder is primitive factor. Various medical options to control voiding and/or storage symptoms with sleep disorder have chosen as monotherapy or combination therapy including alpha-blockers, anticholinergics and antidiuretic hormone for urinary symptoms as well as good sleep hygiene practice of sleep disorder and hypnotics for insomnia. Therefore, to clarify underlying disease to cause patient’s chief complaint is essential resulting to maximize therapeutic results. This lecture will provide pathogenesis, diagnostic approach, ideal pharmacologic treatment with underlying action mechanism and cognitive behavior therapy in elderly with simultaneous sleep disorder and urological disease.",

These all could be the symptoms of stress.\r\nStress might be helpful for short period of time. It has been proven that stress can improve productivity for short span of time but for long duration it can lead to severe illness. It affects our physiology from brain to heart it starts altering their functions.\r\nStress is anything that challenges our state of homeostasis. Stress has both positive and negative impact in our body. It is the respond of our body to stimulus. It is acute – short period stress and chronic – long period stress. It has been observed that positive stress helps in motivation ,increases work efficiency by releasing hormones such as Cortisol, prolactin etc. which trigger our hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA)  axis, resulting increasing heart rate, breathing rate which might not harmful for short duration but for long period – chronic stress it can alter bodily system and give rise to many diseases. It is essential to understand the need of stress management in our daily life.",

      "title": "A Chronic Canine Model of Obstructive Sleep Apnea",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorder that is characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep (1-3). Upper airway closure results in reduction or cessation of breathing, leading to progressive hypoxemia and hypercapnia and increasing inspiratory efforts against the occluded airway. These stimuli ultimately provoke arousal from sleep, which leads to restoration of upper airway patency and resumption of breathing. An increasing body of clinical and epidemiological literature indicates that the sleep fragmentation and recurrent hypoxemia associated with OSA lead to a host of important neuropsychological, cardiovascular, respiratory control, and other disturbances, which in turn result in substantial morbidity and mortality (3-5). However, the investigation of the mechanisms by which these complications are produced has been hampered by the methodologic restrictions inherent to investigations involving humans, and by the fact that once the human condition comes to clinical attention, it has typically been present for some time. It is therefore difficult to determine which abnormalities represent a primaryfactor contributing to the disorder, a secondary complication of it, or an indirectly associated comorbidity.",

Personality patterns are termed traits because they are longstanding and consistent, just like other traits such as eye color, hair texture, and height. State behavior refers to behaviors that come and go, such as a mood state and many DSM axis I conditions. Abnormal behavioral states are assumed to represent illness and underlying brain dysfunction or disease. Abnormal behavioral traits are assumed not to reflect brain dysfunction or disease, but rather a deviance that has developed during a person’s formative years.",

Importantly, rates are rising during the pandemic.Suicidal symptoms can develop with depression and, less commonly, with anxiety disorders.In 2019, almost 25% of girls and more than 10% of boys seriously considered suicide.Symptoms are especially common among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) youth and Black youth.If you are worried your child is thinking about self-harm, contact a health care professional immediately.Parents, teachers, and pediatric primary care clinicians can monitor for signs of depression and anxiety including school difficulties, changes in sleep or eating, getting along with friends or family, withdrawing from activities, and using screening questionnaires for depression or anxiety in health care visits.Depression and anxiety are treatable with therapy that teaches specific skills, medications, or both.Specific treatment plans de-pend on age, severity of symptoms, ability to access therapy, and family preferences.Families can take care of your own mental health, talk about feelings starting at an early age; teach and model healthy coping strategies; keep your child safe from weapons, abuse, and preventable incidents; and talk to your child's health care professional.Some family and community health strategies to prevent depressionandanxietyincludeparentsaccessingtheirownmentalhealthcare; teaching families skills for effective communication and managing feelings;introducinganti-bullyingandantidiscriminationactivities;supporting families to access basic needs like food and safe housing; and preventing exposure to extreme stresses like abuse and disasters.",

Despite the experimental work which has been reported on the subject there is little accurate knowledge concerning the essential basis of the phenomena of sleep or concerning the real effects of disturbances of the rhythm of sleep. Stories concerning death produced by continued wakefulness or of mental disease produced by long vigils have been current for many years. There are, however, no actually observed cases recorded in the medical literature which clearly indicate that extended vigils produce either mental disease or death. Normal sleep is disturbed in various organic conditions of the central nervous system, such as encephalitis, meningitis, concussion and dementia paralytica, as well as in the functional psychoses, in manic-depressive psychosis and in schizophrenia.

The DSM-V defines insomnia disorder as one or more of: difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or early morning wakening with an inability to fall back asleep. These problems occur despite adequate time allowed for sleep (7 hours), cause dysfunction, and are not attributed to another disorder. The DSM-V then classifies insomnia as either episodic (at least 1 month but less than 3 months), persistent (lasting 3 months or more) and recurrent (2 or more episodes within a year), and considers potential contributing comorbidities. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) classification system, symptoms must occur at least 3 times per week, and insomnia is categorized as either short term or chronic. Short-term insomnia disorder in this paradigm (ICSD-3) occurs when the sleep problems have lasted more than 1 but less than 3 months, while chronic insomnia disorder occurs when symptoms persist for more than 3 months.",

Spontaneous nystagmus:It is nystagmus that occurs randomly, regardless of the position of the patient's head.

Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) has been reported in 30–80% of patients with schizophrenia. In bipolar disorder, sleep disturbances have been shown to be triggers for manic episodes, including irregular sleep timing and reduced total sleep time. Further mechanistic evidence for a link between the circadian system and bipolar disorder comes from work on animal models. Another factor that should be considered in this context is that circadian rhythms and sleep are mechanistically different, albeit interacting, processes. A number of potential mechanisms that may account for SCRD in psychosis are summarized and discussed in more detail in the chapter.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms vary moment-to-moment within a day. One factor that may influence these variations is chronotype. Evening chronotypes prefer to engage in activities (e.g., sleep, physical and social activity) later in the day, and evening chronotype is implicated in psychopathology, including anxiety-related disorders. However, it is unknown whether chronotype influences diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and whether these effects are amplified in individuals with a probable anxiety-related disorder. We examined the diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and daily activities in morning and evening chronotypes with and without probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a community sample of adults (N = 410). Evening chronotypes reported higher anxiety symptoms, particularly in the evening hours, and lower engagement in daily activities, predominantly in the morning hours. Evening chronotypes with probable GAD or OCD reported worse anxiety symptoms in the evening. Our findings indicate that anxiety symptoms and engagement in daily activities fluctuate considerably across the day, and these patterns differ depending on chronotype. Evening chronotypes have more anxiety symptoms in the evening, despite preferring this time of day. Personalized treatment approaches that consider chronotype and target certain times of day may be efficient in alleviating peaks in anxiety symptoms.",

A mild form of sleepiness can be associated with reduced reactivity and modest distractibility symptoms, but more severe symptomatic forms are characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrollable need to sleep, causing sudden sleep attacks, amnesia and automatic behaviors. The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances. An accurate medical history cannot be sufficient for the differential diagnosis, therefore instrumental recordings by means of polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are mandatory for a correct diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of EDS.",

The paradox refers to the disparity between the alert EEG pattern, implying that the person is awake or nearly so, and the indications that the person is actually more deeply asleep than at other times (difficulty in arousing, reduced muscle tone). The lack of muscle tone prevents the sleeper from performing the activities reflected in the alert EEG pattern. REM without atonia or REM behavior disorder is a sleep disorder in which the atonia fails to occur, with the result that the sleeper may actually perform his or her REM sleep actions.",

      "abstract": "Ayurveda “Science of life” is a unique combination of science and philosophy that balances the holistic aspects of health i.e. physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Its aim is to promote and preserve physical and mental health and cure of ailments too. In order to lead a good quality of life both physical and mental health of a person should be maintained in good conditions. Now a days, even people know the importance of mental health as due to their busy lifestyle usually they succumb to unhealthy lifestyle which later pose harm to their health. Due to extreme stress in life people are becoming susceptible to various mental and lifestyle health issues like anxiety, depression, HTN, Diabetes and insomnia. Insomnia is defined as a condition where a person is unable to sleep or does not have a sound and sufficient sleep and wakes up usually tired and exhausted. The general causes of insomnia include stressful lifestyle, environmental influence, mental tension, changed food habits or any mental trauma. It is generally of two types: acute insomnia and chronic insomnia. The acute insomnia is referred to a condition one with short duration of few days to few weeks and the second chronic insomnia is which lasts for longer duration of few months to even years. Some of the major symptoms of insomnia include: difficulty in falling asleep at night, sleeplessness, waking up abruptly while sleeping and then not being able to fall asleep again, waking up tired and exhausted, irritability, sometimes wake up with headache, less concentration and low mood throughout the day, over thinking and worry related to sleep. There are various treatments available for this ailment in the form of oral medicines and therapies. In Ayurvedic treatment for insomnia some therapies such as Shirodhara and herbal medicines like Brahmi, Ashwagandha, Sarpgandha are known to produce calming and relaxing effect and result in sound and good sleep. This paper aims to compile and review the classical literature regarding management of Anidra; scientifically reported classical and non-classical sedative herbs; and clinical trials conducted on Anidra.",

      "abstract": "Any physical or psychological stimuli that disrupt homeostasis result in a stress response. The stimuli are called stressors and physiological and behavioral changes in response to exposure to stressors constitute the stress response. A stress response is mediated by a complex interplay of nervous, endocrine, and immune mechanisms that involves activation of the sympathetic-adreno-medullar (SAM) axis, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and immune system. The stress response is adaptive, to begin with, that prepares the body to handle the challenges presented by an internal or external environmental challenge (stressor) e.g., the body's physiologic responses to trauma and invasive surgery serve to attenuate further tissue damage. But if the exposure to a stressor is actually or perceived as intense, repetitive (repeated acute stress), or prolonged (chronic stress), the stress response becomes maladaptive and detrimental to physiology e.g., exposure to chronic stressors can cause maladaptive reactions including depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and heart disease.",

First, an overview is provided of the fundamental principles, assessment tools, and nosology systems in sleep medicine. Subsequent sections focus specifically on the etiology, assessment, and evidence-based treatment of the following conditions: insomnia disorder, delayed and advanced circadian phase disorders, irregular sleep–wake rhythm disorder, non–24-hour sleep–wake rhythm disorder, narcolepsy, hypersomnolence disorder, and parasomnias. These represent the sleep and circadian rhythm disorders that are most commonly encountered by mental health practitioners. The final section highlights sleep and circadian disturbances in the context of four other psychiatric disorders: depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.",

Next there is a discussion of performance decrements soon after awakening from sleep (sleep inertia), and the “post-lunch dip” in performance that can sometimes arise when the early afternoon (siesta) gate to sleep is open. There then follows a discussion of the effects on sleepiness and performance of total sleep deprivation (TSD), when one or more whole nights of sleep are missed, and chronic partial sleep deprivation (CPSD), when sleep is abbreviated for a week or more at a time. The chapter ends with a discussion of the practical real-life consequences of fatigue-related performance failures, particularly in transportation and medical care.",

Polysomnographic sleep research has demonstrated that besides impaired sleep continuity, sleep in depression is characterized by a reduction of slow wave sleep and a disinhibition of random eye movement (REM) sleep, with a shortening of REM latency, a prolongation of the first REM period and increased REM density.Our own experimental work has focused on the reciprocal interaction hypothesis of non-REM and REM sleep regulation as a model to explain the characteristic features of depressed sleep.In agreement with the major tenet of this model, administration of cholinomimetics provoked shortened REM latency in healthy subjects and led to an even stronger REM sleep disinhibition in depressed patients. Manipulations of the sleep-wake cycle, such as sleep deprivation or a phase advance of the sleep period, alleviate depressive symptoms.These data indicate a strong bidirectional relationship between sleep, sleep alterations and depression.",

Physical activity and sleep exhibit positive synergy, whereby each optimizes quality of and capability for the other. Our sedentary, sleep-restricted lifestyle conflicts with our genotype to generate pathophysiologic phenotypes, especially obesity. Insufficient sleep is pandemic, and other sleep disorders are increasingly common. Sleep dysfunction promotes obesity due to inactivity from sleepiness and to metabolic changes. Obesity is the primary risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea, which commonly disrupts sleep. This represents one of many pathophysiologic vicious cycles involving inactivity, sleep disorders, and obesity. Solutions include better education of the medical community, which remains surprisingly ignorant about these disease processes and therapeutic advantages of exercise and sleep repletion. Doctors commonly prescribe medications with sleep disruption or weight-gain side effects instead of lifestyle modifications. Lifestyle improvements often provide superior treatment to medications and impose no side effects.",

The presence of behavioral insomnia of childhood (BIC) may be influenced by a range of biological, temperamental, and behavioral factors. From a clinical standpoint, however, one of the most frequent causes of BIC is sleep-related or nighttime fears. Extinction procedures also are frequently combined with other procedures to increase bedtime compliance and facilitate easier transitions to sleep. Bedtime fading involves delaying bedtime until the child appears naturally sleepy and then systematically moving to an earlier bedtime based on mastery of sleep initiation. The parent–child interaction is the primary context for behavior change in the treatment of BIC. Diagnostic evaluation for behavioral sleep problems such as insomnia or nighttime fears typically includes a structured interview with parents and children.",

At 40, 44, and 48 weeks postconception, the number of respiratory pauses of 2 to 4.9 seconds and of 5 to 9.9 seconds duration per 100 minutes of state, during rapid eye movement, and indeterminate sleep are decreased in infants with colds. The absence of this phenomenon at 52 weeks suggests that it is modified by maturation. We hypothesize that the reduction in rapid eye movement and indeterminate sleep apnea is a manifestation of an adaptive response in normal infants, but for infants at risk for the sudden infant death syndrome, this response may be overwhelmed, resulting in increased apnea and, in some instances, sudden infant death.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Infants epidemiologically at high risk for SIDS demonstrate a variety of abnormalities in sleep-state organization, maturation, and sleep-state modulation of cardio-respiratory control mechanisms. These involve both the REM and quiet-sleep states and are seen in twins who have had no evidence of clinical cardio-respiratory compromise during infancy as well as in near-miss infants who have suffered serious cardio-respiratory failure. Although these infants have higher levels of REM sleep around 40 weeks, of special concern is the decrease in the maturation of the quiet system, which becomes evident after 44 weeks, and the reported quiet-sleep abnormalities in reflex control of respiration and arousal. The source of these abnormalities is environmental rather than genetic and most likely occurs prenatally. During the critical period for SIDS, infant sleep begins to coalesce from a series of naps to more prolonged night time sleep periods that last up to 8 hours. We believe that the ability to maintain physiologic homeostasis during prolonged sleep is a challenge facing infants who are epidemiologically at risk for sudden infant death. The challenge facing sleep research is the more complete understanding of the relationship between prolonged inhibition, homeostasis, arousal, and development.",

The elderly usually go to bed in early evening and wake up in early morning, and they also take several naps in the day time. The polyphasic sleep is one of the typical sleep patterns found in the elderly. Comparing the sleep of the elderly with that of young adults by the method of polysomnography, the characteristics of the sleep of the elderly are in the prolongation of sleep latency, shortening of total sleep time, increase of Stage W and Stage 1, decrease of Stage 3 and 4, and also decrease of Stage REM and the advance of REM phase. Insomnia is a frequently observed symptom in the elderly. The so-called psychophysiological insomnia due to transient psychological or situational stress is common in the elderly. However, insomnia following the mental disturbance (depression), chronic use of drug or alcohol, dementia (vascular or Alzheimer type) are also important in the elderly. Sleep apnea syndrome is recently found as an important cause of insomnia. Concerning the treatment and prevention of insomnia, it is necessary to exclude the causes of insomnia, to improve the environmental conditions and to keep the regular rhythm of sleep-wake cycle. It is also important to carefully select and use the adequate hypnotics considering the pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of the drugs in the elderly.",

      "title": "Jet lag syndrome: circadian organization, pathophysiology, and management strategies",
      "abstract": "The circadian system regulates the cyclical occurrence of wakefulness and sleep through a series of oscillatory networks that comprise two different theoretical processes. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus contains the master oscillatory network necessary for coordinating these daily rhythms, and in addition to its ability to robustly generate rhythms, it can also synchronize to environmental light cues. During jet lag, abrupt shifts in the environmental light-dark cycle temporarily desynchronize the SCN and downstream oscillatory networks from each other, resulting in increased sleepiness and impaired daytime functioning. Polysomnographic data show that not only does jet lag result in changes of sleep-wake timing, but also in different aspects of sleep architecture. This type of circadian misalignment can further lead to a cluster of symptoms including major metabolic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, and neurological impairments. There are a number of treatment options for jet lag involving bright light exposure, melatonin, and use of hypnotics, but their efficacy greatly depends on their time of use, the length of time in the new time zone, and the specific circadian disturbance involved. The aim of this review is to provide mechanistic links between the fields of sleep and circadian rhythms to understand the biological basis of jet lag and to apply this information to clinical management strategies.",

In 25 healthy subjects, variable amounts of sleep loss (1-3 h for 1-3 nights) caused headaches lasting from 1 h to all day. The headache was most frequently a dull ache, a heaviness or a pressure sensation felt in the forehead and/or at the vertex. Simple analgesics, purchaseable without a doctor's prescription, completely or markedly reduced the head pain in 20-60 min. Headaches due to insufficient sleep differ from tension headaches in their site, duration and response to analgesics. Assuming that pain implies a regional dysfunction, headaches caused by sleep loss provide support for the notion that sleep has a restorative function in the brain.",

Caracteriza-se por pausas repetidas na respiracao durante o sono, resultantes da obstrucao total ou parcial das vias aereas superiores. A polissonografia (PSG) e considerada padrao-ouro para sua identificacao. O diagnostico de SAHOS considera o numero de eventos respiratorios obstrutivos durante o sono e as manifestacoes clinicas resultantes desses eventos. Esta revisao aborda a apresentacao clinica da SAHOS, seus principais sinais/sintomas e a identificacao de fatores de risco que faci litam seu reconhecimento. Os sinais e sintomas mais comuns sao: ronco, sono nao restaurador, paradas respiratorias durante o sono, insonia, sonolencia diurna, fadiga e falta de concentracao. Os pacientes tambem podem referir cefaleia matinal, irritabilidade e depressao. A SAHOS e mais comum e mais grave em homens acima de 55 anos. A obesidade e o fator de risco mais importante. Alteracoes anatomicas craniofaciais podem causar reducao do calibre das vias aereas. Sendo a PSG um exame complexo e de custo elevado, instrumentos para uso na pratica clinica tem sido validados, destacando-se a Escala de Sonolencia de Epworth e o Questionario de Berlim. O treinamento de medicos da atencao basica e a disponibilidade de especialistas do sono com a incorporacao da historia do sono na anamnese e a utilizacao de instrumentos simples de rastreamento podem reduzir a subidentificacao da SAHOS, possibilitando o tratamento de um numero maior de pacientes e a prevencao de complicacoes associadas.

We performed serial polysomnography to determine the association of nocturnal CH attacks and sleep.Five patients diagnosed with CH (two with the episodic and three with the chronic subtype) were included and studied over four consecutive nights to evaluate connections between attacks onset and sleep stage.Twenty typical CH attacks were reported. Thirteen of these attacks arose from sleep. Seven attacks were reported after waking in the morning or shortly before going to sleep. The beginnings of sleep-related attacks were distributed arbitrarily between different non-REM sleep stages. No association of CH attacks with REM or sleep disordered breathing was observed. Increased heart rate temporally associated with transition from one sleep state to another was observed before patients awoke with headache. Total sleep time, total wake time, arousal index and distribution of non-REM sleep stages were different between chronic and episodic CH.CH attacks are not associated with REM sleep. Brain regions involved in sleep stage transition might be involved in pathophysiology of CH. Differences in sleep characteristics between subgroups might indicate adaptation processes or underlying pathophysiology.",

Usually stress creates delays (because the body needs to stop what it was doing at the moment and mobilize for response to the stressor). These delays destroy the harmony of biorhythms [1], which means stress disturbs the body regulating mechanisms. This results in a chronic disease of the genetically inherited weak organ or cancer. ‘Chronic’ means ‘slow’. It takes a lot of stress accumulation to shift the regulating mechanism out of balance.

Sleep deprivation and sleepiness in general have been associated with poor job performance, anxiety, difficulties in personal relations, and an increased risk for fatal and nonfatal automobile accidents, daytime sleepiness resulting from chronic partial or total sleep deprivation has been demonstrated to result in neurocognitive deficits and alterations in mood, and more recently to cause alterations in physiological and endocrine functions (4–26).

      "abstract": "The prevalence of reported sleep disturbances in a general popula- tion is high. Many of the complaints are the result of sleep-related breathing dis- orders, due mainly to the occurrence of obstructive and central apnoeas. Obstructive sleep apnoea is a fully described and well-recognized entity. Central sleep apnoea (CSA) however, has been poorly studied. There is accumulating evidence that central sleep apnoea should be considered as the end of a spectrum. Instability in the breathing pattern is the main under- lying mechanism and is due to the interaction of many factors. Breathing during sleep is dependent on metabolic control and the activity of the respiratory muscles. Decreased chemical drive and/or failing respiratory muscle function are associated with CSA and usually also with ongoing hypoventilation during wakefulness, char- acterized by chronic daytime hypercapnia. Central respiratory drive can also be inhibited by upper airway reflexes. Mostly, however, CSA occurs as the hallmark of unstable breathing during sleep brought about by an overall increase in loop gain (especially in light sleep stages) and the unmasking of a CO 2 threshold. Arousal following central apnoeas acts as an amplification of the instability. Micro electroencephographic (EEG) arousals are often observed as a consequence of CSA. They are responsible for sleep fragmentation and hypersomnolence during the day. The daytime hypersomnolence and complaints of awakenings during sleep in patients with CSA can be striking. CSA can occur in specific pathologies, such as chronic heart failure and (post-traumatic) brain lesions, that are associated with irregular breathing. Treatment strategies are remarkably few in number. Use of nasal ventilation and the inhalation of CO 2 are mainly of theoretical interest, since patients do not often tolerate these more invasive therapies. Drug treatment, especially with aceta- zolamide, is easier to perform. Stimulation of upper airway reflexes, by less inva- sive methods, seems to be promising for the near future.",

Aunque tradicionalmente se ha asumido que el dolor es la causa de los problemas de sueno de estas personas, las evidencias al respecto muestran que la relacion entre estas variables es mas compleja. Por una parte, diversos estudios experimentales (tanto de restriccion de sueno como de induccion de dolor durante el sueno) e investigaciones clinicas (transversales y longitudinales) sugieren que las relaciones entre sueno y dolor podrian ser bidireccionales. De esta manera, el dolor perturbaria tanto la calidad como la continuidad del sueno (ya sea en forma de despertares o en forma de arousals que aligeran el sueno y, por lo tanto, modifican la arquitectura del sueno) y un sueno de mala calidad agravaria la experiencia de dolor (al disminuir los umbrales nociceptivos). Por otra parte, existen estructuras cerebrales comunes tanto a los mecanismos asociados a la modulacion del dolor como a los asociados al funcionamiento del ciclo sueno-vigilia. Por lo tanto, es esperable la existencia de alteraciones estructurales y funcionales en el sistema nervioso central de los pacientes con fibromialgia. Este hecho sugiere que el tratamiento de los problemas de sueno podria ser un objetivo terapeutico crucial en los pacientes con fibromialgia, ya que los potenciales beneficios irian mas alla de la mejora del sueno y se relacionarian con una disminucion de la intensidad del dolor y cambios positivos en otros sintomas asociados (como pueden ser el distres psicologico, el funcionamiento diario o la ejecucion neuropsicologica). La presente tesis se ha planteado para intentar dar respuesta a varios de los interrogantes acerca de las interrelaciones que se dan entre el sueno y el dolor en pacientes con fibromialgia, intentando superar ciertas limitaciones habituales en este tipo de estudios (asociadas principalmente a una evaluacion inadecuada del sueno).",

A significant proportion is related to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, either diffuse or focal (e.g., stroke). Neonatal brain injury is recognized clinically by a characteristic encephalopathy that evolves over days in the newborn period. This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births.

      "abstract": "Movements during sleep are quite common, especially among children and usually represent a benign and not intimidating condition. However, not infrequently, the presence of non-quiet sleep leads patients or their families to consult their family physician, since movements during sleep may be associated with several somatic or mental disorders, and may result in decreased quality of life. There are several clinical syndromes of pathological movements during sleep, which are usually classified according to the sleep stage at which they tend to occur. While the restless leg syndrome is one of the most common movement disorders, it usually occurs during wakefulness but commonly results in insomnia and is frequently associated with the periodic leg movement disorder of sleep. The movement disorders under parasomnias consists predominantly of disorders of arousal, sleep-wake transition disorders (rhythmic movement disorders), and rapid eye movement (REM) related disorders. This review briefly describes these movement disorders in sleep, and highlights their diagnosis and treatment. It emphasizes the recent development and novel knowledge in this field in recent years.",

This article examines the psychiatric disorders that are most often associated to sleep dysfunction as it is related in clinical practice and describes the polysomnographic findings. Patient's main complaints are related to difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep (initial or middle insomnia, respectively) and poor quality of sleep. Early awakening or terminal insomnia is most described in the depressive conditions. Hypersomnia may be the main symptom in some depressive disorders, as seasonal depression, depression with atypical features or depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. Polysomnographic evaluation shows, in general, a significative reduction in the efficiency and total time of sleep, in detriment to the amount of slow wave sleep. The reduction of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency is mainly described for the depression, but has also been reported in other psychiatric disorders.",

Multiple system atrophy is a synucleopathy, as are Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Patients with multiple system atrophy exhibit parkinsonian features and have difficulty with balance and with walking. Cognitive dysfunction includes mainly problems with verbal fluency and executive functioning. The main distinguishing feature of multiple system atrophy is a disturbance in the functioning of the autonomic division of the nervous system, which controls involuntary muscles and fundamental biological functions. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system begins early in the course of multiple system atrophy. Erectile dysfunction and urinary symptoms may be the first signs of this disorder. Later, orthostatic hypotension, sleep-related breathing disorders, and excessive daytime sleepiness are characteristic. Multiple system atrophy is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to death within approximately 10 years of onset.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Misalignment between endogenous circadian rhythms and the light/dark cycle can result in pathological disturbances in the form of erratic sleep timing (irregular sleep–wake rhythm), complete dissociation from the light/dark cycle (circadian rhythm sleep disorder, free-running type), delayed sleep timing (delayed sleep phase disorder), or advanced sleep timing (advanced sleep phase disorder). Whereas these four conditions are thought to involve predominantly intrinsic mechanisms, circadian dysrhythmias can also be induced by exogenous challenges, such as those imposed by extreme work schedules or rapid transmeridian travel, which overwhelm the ability of the master clock to entrain with commensurate rapidity, and in turn impair approximation to a desired sleep schedule, as evidenced by the shift work and jet lag sleep disorders. This review will focus on etiological underpinnings, clinical assessments, and evidence-based treatment options for circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Topics are subcategorized when applicable, and if sufficient data exist. The length of text associated with each disorder reflects the abundance of associated literature, complexity of management, overlap of methods for assessment and treatment, and the expected prevalence of each condition within general medical practice.

      "title": "REM sleep behavior disorder - past, present, and future",
      "abstract": "The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a fascinating experiment of nature predicted by animal experiments nearly 40 years ago. Active paralysis of somatic muscles is one of the defining features of REM sleep. In the catmodel of REM sleep behavior disorder, bilateral perilocus ceruleus lesions result in loss of the expected atonia of REM sleep, resulting in dream-enacting (oneiric) behaviors. In humans, REM sleep behavior disorder presents as complex behaviors arising from REM sleep, as the persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep permits the acting out of dreams, often with violent or injurious consequences to the patient or bed partner. These behaviors include talking, yelling, swearing, grabbing, punching, kicking, jumping, or running out of the bed and may result in lacerations, ecchymoses, or fractures. The acute, or transient, form is usually drug-induced (most commonly tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] or serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). REM sleep behavior disorder may also be a manifestation of narcolepsy. The chronic form is seen predominantly in men (80-90%) over 50 years of age. Initially felt to be idiopathic, it is now becoming apparent that spontaneous REM sleep behavior disorder is often a harbinger of degenerative neurological conditions, most commonly one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or dementia with Lewy body disease). Interestingly, the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder precede any other manifestations of the underlying neurodegenerative disorders by an average of over 10 years. It is readily diagnosed by formal sleep studies which reveal persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep. Most cases of REM sleep behavior disorder respond dramatically to clonazepam administered at bedtime.",

The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "title": "Approaches to the Pharmacological Management of Jet Lag",
      "abstract": "For many years now a treatment mitigating the debilitating effects of jet lag has been sought. Rapid travel across time zones leads, in most people, to temporary symptoms, in particular poor sleep, daytime alertness and poor performance. Mis-timed circadian rhythms are considered to be the main factor underlying jet-lag symptoms, together with the sleep deprivation from long haul flights. Virtually all aspects of physiology are rhythmic, from cells to systems, and circadian rhythms are coordinated by a central pacemaker or clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN adapts slowly to changes in time zone, and peripheral clocks or oscillators adapt at different rates, such that the organism is in a state of desynchrony from the external environment and internally. Light exposure is the main factor controlling the circadian system and needs to be considered together with any pharmacological interventions. This review covers the relatively new chronobiotic drugs, which can hasten adaptation of the circadian system, together with drugs directly affecting alertness and sleep propensity. No current treatment can instantly shift circadian phase to a new time zone; however, adaptation can be hastened. The melatoninergic drugs are promising but larger trials in real-life situations are needed. For short stopovers it is recommended to preserve sleep and alertness without necessarily modifying the circadian system. New research suggests that modification of clock function via genetic manipulation may one day have clinical applications.",

The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

This review focuses on possible negative effects of sleep deprivation, decreased quality of life, and psychosocial status in patients with psoriasis and highlights their mutual, complex relationship of divergent consequences. The relationship between sleep disorders and psychosocial status in patients with psoriasis is bidirectional and resembles a vicious circle, one abnormality triggering the other. Sleep disorders additionally increase the risk of metabolic and psychiatric diseases in psoriatic patients who are already at increased risk of developing such disorders. There should be measures taken to screen patients with psoriasis for sleep disorders in order to diagnose early and treat.",

Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

Anksioznost kao psihicki poremecaj ukljucuje i specificne simptome koji dovode do neurobioloske disfunkcije, te zahtijevaju posebne terapijske procedure, a smanjuju socijalnu i radnu sposobnost. Simptomi karakteristicni za anksioznost dijele se na psiholoske i tjelesne simptome. Psiholoski simptomi su: pretjerana plasljivost i strahovanje, osjecaj unutarnje napetosti i nemira, smetnje koncentacije, pojacana osjetljivost na buku, smetnje spavanja, smetnje u pamcenju. Tjelesni se simptomi mogu ocitovati na gotovo svim organskim sustavima. Karakteristicni su : kardiovaskularni, respiratorni, gastrointestinalni, genito-urinarni, neuroloski. Anksiozni poremecaji praceni su visokom stopom suicidalnosti, a predisponiraju i za razvoj raznovrsnih psihosomatskih bolesti.\r\n Psiholoske teorije anksioznost objasnjavaju kao premjestanje intrapsihickog konflikta (psihodinamski model), te kao fenomen uvjetovanja (kognitivno bihevioralni model).\r\n Psihodinamska teorija anksioznost objasnjava kao konflikt između ida i ega.\r\n Kognitivna teorija anksioznost objasnjava kao tendenciju prekomjerne procjene potencijala za opasnost.\r\n Dijagnoza se temelji na pažljivo prikupljenoj anamnezi, procjeni psihickog i somatskog statusa te ucinjenih somatskih pregleda i pretraga.\r\n Najcesci anksiozni poremecaji su:\r\n *generalizirani anksiozni poremecaj\r\n *panicni poremecaj\r\n *fobije\r\n *anksiozno depresivni poremecaj\r\n *opsesivno kompulzivni poremecaj\r\n *anksioznost u organskih bolesnika\r\n *posttraumatski stresni poremecaj\r\n Lijecenje se sastoji od kombinacije farmakoterapije i psihoterapije.\r\n Provodi se ambulantno i bolnicki. Pri hospitalizaciji bolesnika medicinska sestra najcesce je prvi strucnjak koji dolazi u kontakt s njim. U radu sa psihijatrijskim bolesnikom medicinska sestra se pridržava nacela zdravstvene njege psihijatrijskog bolesnika. Medicinska sestra prati bolesnika prilikom boravka na odjelu u njegovim aktivnostima u koje je ukljucen na odjelu, susrece se sa pacijentovom obitelji, uocava promjene i izvjestava lijecnika i strucni tim.\r\n Osnova cjelokupnog terapijskog djelovanja u radu medicinske sestre s anksioznim bolesnicima usmjerena je na smanjenje tenzija. Medicinska sestra svojom emocionalnom toplinom, spremnoscu da razumije i reagira stvara i produbljuje odnos između nje i bolesnika. Spremnost medicinske sestre da razgovara sa pacijentom daje pacijentu osjecaj da se sestra brine za njega i da mu pruža sigurnost, te da ga prihvaca sa svim manama i vrlinama.",

      "abstract": "Medications with cognitive effects and/or side effects also affect sleep and dreaming. The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "title": "Physiological and psychological factors in sleep-onset insomnia.",
      "abstract": "A group of insomniacs whose only sleep-stage abnormality was prolonged sleep latency was identified. Prior to sleep onset, these subjects had significantly higher levels of physiological activity than did normal sleepers. With the approach of sleep onset, these differences diminished. No group differences in presleep cognitive activity were found. Insomniacs had significantly higher Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores than normal on scales indicating neuroticism, anxiety, and worry (derived from the Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales). Although sleep-onset insomnia is accompanied by psychological disturbance and heightened physiological activity, it is unlikely that either factor alone is sufficient to cause it. Excessive rumination may be an epiphenomenon of sleeplessness. Chronic insomnia is a distressing complaint that affects millions of persons (Solomon, 1979). Three general types of insomnia have been described: initial, or sleep-onset; intermittent, or sleep-maintenance; and terminal, or early morning awakening (Kleitman, 1963). The present investigation is concerned with primary idiopathic sleep-onset insomnia: the inability to fall asleep in the absence of identifiable physiological or psychological determinants. Many theories have been advanced to explain idiopathic insomnia (Rechtschaffen & Monroe, 1969). Two of the most popular suggest that insomniacs are either physiologically or cognitively hyperaroused relative to normal (Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, 1979; Borkovec, 1979). Support for the first hypothesis has rested largely on a study by Monroe (1967), demonstrating that self-defined poor sleepers had higher levels of physiological activity than good",

Subsequently, people with spinal cord injuries report daytime symptoms such as fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, difficult concentration, and impaired quality of life. Fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness can be associated with pain, spasticity, depression, side effects of medications, postural discomfort, and autonomic dysfunction in people with spinal cord injuries.",

Some published results of extensive investigations of breathing patterns, in both infants at risk and controls, appear contradictory or prove disappointing. Little, if any, progress has been made in either our understanding of the cause of SIDS or our ability to predict it or deal with it effectively.

      "abstract": "Organizational stressStress a term in psychology and biology first coined in the biological context in the 1930s, which has in more recent decades become commonly used in popular /wiki/Vernacularparlance. It refers to the consequence of the failure of an organism human or animal to respond appropriately to emotional or physical threats, whether actual or imagined.Signs of stress may be cognitive, emotional, physical or behavioral. Signs include poor judgment, a general negative outlook, excessive worrying, moodiness, irritability, agitation, inability to relax, feeling lonely, isolated or depressed, aches and pains, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, dizziness, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, eating too much or not enough, sleeping too much or not enough, social withdrawal, procrastination or neglect of responsibilities, increased alcohal, nicotine or drug consumption, and nervous habits such as pacing about, nail-biting and neck pains.Occupational stress stress involving work. According to the current World Health Organization's (WHO) definition, occupational or work-related stress is the response people may have when presented with work demands and pressures that are not matched to their knowledge and abilities and which challenge their ability to cope.Job satisfactionThe job satisfaction the end feeling of a person after performing a task. To the extent that a person's job fulfill his expectations and values, the job will be satisfying. The feeling will be positive or negative depending upon whether need satisfied or not.The job satisfaction of professional women as important as the organizational climate of any organization. Organization climate a leading indicator of organizational performance. Organizational climate may be thought of as the summary perception, which people have about an organization. It a global expression of what an organization is. Organization climate manifestation of attitudes of organizational members towards the organizational itself. Motivation and behaviour of organizational members are significantly influenced by organizational climate. Research on organization climate and its determinants important for enhancing organizational effectiveness, thus making them more relevant for society in general. Good citizenship behaviour in and organization beyond the call of duty rather scarce, but highly sought after by organizations today.The focal importance of a professional women not new to organization thinking. In spite of this recognition, relatively little and reliable information available regarding the job satisfaction of professional women. Job satisfaction refers to the way one feels about the events, people and things in his/her working situation.General healthHealth the level of functional and/or metabolic efficiency of a living being. In humans, it the general condition of a person in mind, body and spirit, usually meaning to being free from illness, injury or pain (as in good or healthy)the World Health Organization (who) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as having a lack of operational value and the problem created by use of the word complete, it remains the most enduring. Classification systems such as the who family of international classifications, which composed of the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF) and the international classification of diseases (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of health.General health, organizational stress and job satisfactionA study was conducted on general health, stress associated to the work and job satisfaction of Hormozgan cement factory employees in Iran by Tabatabaei , Hosseinianb, and Gharanjiki (2011), The aim of the paper was to study the general health, stress associated to the work and job satisfaction of the Hormozgan cement factory employees. …",

Relating to the circadian symptoms, a process is adopted in which individual genetic factors together with social, psychological and physical stressors may lead to a decompensation of the circadian system. The causal connections between depressive disorders and disturbed circadian rhythms have not been completely clarified. Chronobiological therapy is based on these disturbed processes. For the treatment of the circadian symptoms, various scientifically tested chronotherapeutics are available with however different effectiveness and evidence like light therapy or sleep deprivation. The successful treatment of depression also frequently leads to a improvement in altered circadian rhythm.Die Entstehung depressiver Erkrankungen wird im Allgemeinen als multifaktorielles Geschehen verstanden. In den letzten Jahren konnten vielfältige neurobiologische Veränderungen beschrieben werden, die mit der Entstehung und dem Verlauf von depressiven Erkrankungen in Zusammenhang gebracht werden. Das ursprüngliche Paradigma der Monoanminomangelhypothese wird dabei immer weiter relativiert, es resultiert somit mittlerweile ein komplexes, aber immer noch nicht vollständiges Verständnis der Genese dieser Erkrankungen. Dabei greifen die verschiedenen physiologischen Erkrankungsmodelle mit wachsendem Wissensstand zunehmend ineinander über.",

      "abstract": "O envelhecimento populacional impacta no perfil de saúde da população que passar de ter redução de doenças infecciosas e aumento da prevalência de doenças crônicas não transmissíveis (DCNT). As DCNT podem desencadear ansiedade, angústia e insegurança sobre a efetividade do tratamento, o que gera altos níveis de estresse. Desta forma, percebe-se que a doença pode levar ao estresse e vice-versa. O estresse pode afetar a capacidade de concentração, a funcionalidade, o desempenho cognitivo, os relacionamentos sociais e até o sono. Este artigo teve como objetivo realizar uma revisão narrativa de estudos sobre sono, estresse e envelhecimento. Para isso, abordou-se o envelhecimento populacional, os conceitos de sono e estresse e o panorama dos poucos estudos encontrados sobre o tema. A literatura aponta que as mudanças físicas, sociais e psicológicas decorrentes do processo de envelhecimento são fatores que podem desencadear estresse no idoso. O estresse, por sua vez, pode modificar negativamente a qualidade do sono. Porém, estudos sobre estresse cotidiano e qualidade do sono em idosos são escassos. A literatura é farta em pesquisas relacionadas à depressão em idosos, porém o estresse ainda é uma variável pouco contemplada. Seriam interessantes pesquisas robustas que abordem o estresse e suas consequências para a qualidade do sono e a saúde geral dos idosos.",

PD jest chorobą postępującą, w której dochodzi do utraty neuronów dopaminowych istoty czarnej (SN) a cechą patologiczną jest obecność ciał Lewy'ego, złożonych m.in. z białka ?-synukleiny. Gdy utrata neuronów w SN przekroczy ok. 60% wówczas pojawiają się główne objawy kliniczne (ruchowe), czyli bradykinezja, sztywność mięśniowa, drżenie spoczynkowe i zaburzenia postawy, chodu. PD jest chorobą o złożonej etiopatogenezie, w której bardzo ważny jest okres przedkliniczny/prodromalny, bowiem pojawiają się wówczas objawy pozaruchowe, np. osłabienie węchu, depresja czy zaburzenia snu, wyprzedzające nawet o kilkanaście lat fazę kliniczną. Niniejsza praca, poza opisem podstawowych informacji na temat PD, skupia się na zaburzeniach snu, wśród których najważniejszym jest zaburzenie zachowania w czasie snu REM, które może stanowić wczesny marker diagnostyczny rozwijającej się choroby, a tym samym pomóc w poszukiwaniu nowych terapii neuroprotekcyjnych już na wczesnym, prodromalnym etapie.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbance and abnormal circadian rhythm might be closely related to bipolar disorder. Several studies involving disturbed sleep/wake cycle, changes in rhythms such as melatonin and cortisol, clock genes, and circadian preference have shown the relationship between bipolar disorder and circadian rhythm. The results differed across different studies. In some studies, a delay in the circadian rhythm was observed in the depressive episode and advanced circadian rhythm was observed during the manic episode. In other studies, a delay in circadian rhythm was observed independent of mood episodes. Accordingly, circadian rhythm disorder was proposed as a trait marker for bipolar disorder. The altered circadian rhythm may represent a pathological mechanism that contributes to the mood episodes. However, a prospective cohort study is needed for further clarification.",

      "abstract": "In the early premature, the EEG is mostly discontinuous. Discontinuity becomes limited to quiet sleep periods by the 36th week of conceptional age (CA). Temporal theta bursts, or the \"sawtooth\" pattern, come and go between 27 and 32 weeks' CA. Delta brushes attain their maximum about 32 to 34 weeks' CA and disappear about 40 to 44 weeks' CA. Frontal sharp transients have their peak occurrence at 35 or 36 weeks' CA and are still present at 44 to 48 weeks' CA. The background activity is essentially symmetric but transient patterns are less symmetric and frequently asynchronous. Lack of variability in the record is abnormal after 34 weeks' CA. Responses to isolated light flashes are prominent from very early prematurity through full-term. On the other hand, photic driving is frequent in early prematures (29-32 weeks' CA), but it then declines and is difficult to detect in the full-term neonate. Nonspecific responses to stimulation occur from early prematurity. Sleep--waking cycles are clearly discernible about 37 weeks' CA. Active sleep (rapid eye movement) goes from 60% at 34 weeks' CA to the 25% of adulthood at about 8 months of age. The EEG of the full-term newborn has four patterns, corresponding to three states: the low voltage irregular for wakefulness, high voltage slow and tracé alternant for quiet sleep, and the mixed for either wakefulness or active sleep.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a period of relaxation and repair. During sleep, waste products of brain metabolism are removed. It plays central role in maintenance of physiological homeostasis and psychological balance. Sufficient sleep helps us think more clearly, complete complex tasks better and more consistently. One of the important function of sleep is to promote synaptic plasticity and neuronal recovery for proper brain functioning. Memory consolidation, brain growth and repair are other functions proposed for sleep. Problems related to sleep deprivation are being increased in today's modern society. Every day there seems to be twice as much work and half as much time to complete it, this results in a decrease in sleep or extended periods of wakefulness. Sleep deprived individuals may not have difficulty of verbal disturbances but research studies have shown that individuals have more difficulty in reacting well, to taking biological discussion and implementing the task with efficiency of action. Although day time performance due to sleep loss is experienced universally but in professionals such as paramilitary forces, army personals, who work under stressful conditions are more vulnerable to the sleep deprivation. These conditions become more stressful during emergencies and war because, after periods of extended wakefulness neurons may begin to malfunction, visibly affecting person's behavior. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep plays a role in learning due to an activation of the hippocampus involved in encoding new memories. Many experiments have shown that the day after a good night's sleep, one may retain newly acquired knowledge or a newly learned skill more effectively. An enriched environment (EE) which is a complex combination of social, cognitive, and physical stimulation, improves learning and memory. Many changes such as increased brain weight, synaptic plasticity, gliogenesis, growth of dendritic spine as well as change in neurotransmitter content, up regulation of neuronal signaling molecules, neurotrophin levels and adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been reported.",

      "title": "Sleep Apnea Syndrome: More Than Benign Snoring Implications for the Cardiovascular System",
      "abstract": "Sleep disordered breathing is a rather common problem in the general population. Apnea during sleep can be divided into three types: central, obstructive and mixed. In central apneas there is lack of both airflow and respiratory efforts. It is recognized by its waxing-waning pattern of respiration called Cheyne- Stokes respiration. Central sleep apnea is most commonly seen in patients with heart failure and its prevalence among this group of patients is estimated to be as high as 30-40%. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs approximately in 5-15% of the general population. It usually affects middle-aged men with an increased body-mass index and a large neck circumference. It is characterized by repetitive complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, which is followed by increasing and ineffective respiratory efforts. Sleep fragmentation in patients with sleep apnea syndrome results in sleepiness, fatigue, morning headaches and depression. This daytime presentation together with loud snoring, choking and pauses of respiration during sleep should make primary care physicians suspicious of sleep disordered breathing. The best method used for the diagnosis of sleep apnea syndrome is overnight polysomnography. The pathophysiologic mechanisms, which take place in sleep apnea, include sympathetic activation, hypercoagulability, inflammation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and metabolic dysfunction. All these mechanisms are associated with the development and progression of cardiovascular disease. There is a strong linkage between sleep apnea and hypertension, systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, stroke and pulmonary disease. Given the increased morbidity and mortality of patients with sleep apnea, an effective treatment must be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made. Currently, nasal continuous positive airway pressure constitutes first line therapy. This therapy improves both quality of sleep and cardiovascular and general outcomes.",

Although most of such complaints can be attributed to the changes in the sleep architecture as we grow old, primary sleep disorders are more prevalent in elderly [2]. Poor sleep due to these disorders results in increased risk of significant morbidity and mortality. As we age, sleep efficiency decreases as time spent in bed increases. Underlying sleep disorders are aggravated due to a decrease in the ability to get needed sleep. However, the decreased ability is less a function of age and more a function of other factors that accompany aging, such as medical and psychiatric illness, increased medication use, advances in the endogenous circadian clock and a higher prevalence of specific sleep disorders.",

      "title": "[Sleep disorders and dementia].",
      "abstract": "A clinically relevant sleep-wake disturbance is found in up to half the patients with dementia, and the sundowning agitation is a common cause of institutionalisation of demented geriatric patients. The circadian rhythm of demented patients is levelled off with increased daytime sleep and disrupted night sleep. Particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and depression the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer's disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases. Greatly increased daytime sleepiness or striking insomnia at the very beginning of suspected dementia should thus prompt the search for other, possibly treatable causes of dementia. Neuropathological and neurophysiological studies support the hypothesis of a deteriorated hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (harbouring the biological clock) as a cause for the deranged circadian sleep-wake system in dementia. Management of sundowning behaviour includes restriction of daytime sleep, exposure to bright lights, and social interaction schedules during the day. The benzodiazepines and analogues usually not being sufficiently effectual, low doses of mild neuroleptics are often needed. Whether recent reports on efficacy of melatonin in elderly insomniacs also apply to demented patients is yet uncertain. The careful search and treatment of possible extracerebral physiologic factors causing reversible hypersomnia or insomnia is an important requisite. Polysomnographic studies are needed to recognise treatable sleep disturbance which could deteriorate or mimic dementia and sundowning. Particularly, a sleep-apnea-hypopnea syndrome must be searched for at the beginning of a suspected dementia, when successful treatment is still possible. Sleep studies should also identify periodic leg movements of sleep with restless legs and/or increased daytime sleepiness, and hyperkinetic parasomnias such as REM sleep behaviour disorder which may complicate or imitate sundowning.",

      "title": "Wake up to gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease: The interplay between arousal and night‐time reflux",
      "abstract": "Summary This review examines the temporal association between nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux and sleep‐arousal cycles. Most nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux events occur during the awake cycle, and arousals precede most nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux events, indicating that arousal from sleep predisposes to nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux. This sheds light on the complex relationship between nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux and sleep, and has implications for managing nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms. The appearance of symptoms and the pathophysiology of nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux are influenced by sleep hygiene, sleep disturbances and the misalignment of circadian rhythms. Nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux and its related sleep disorders are prevalent and negatively impact the quality of life. There is conflicting evidence on whether nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux and sleep disturbances are causally linked, and whether sleep disturbances drive nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux. Poor sleep quality increases oesophageal hypersensitivity and overall acid exposure. The nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux is linked to the more severe forms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, especially with atypical/extra‐oesophageal manifestations and complications of mucosal damage such as oesophagitis and stricture, Barret's oesophagus, and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. This review highlights the role of sleep problems in presenting nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux, and the potential benefits of treating sleep disturbances in enhancing patient care and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age worldwide, along with painful menstruation and genital inflammation. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. A severe form of PMS is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which requires psychiatric management. The onset and severity of PMS with multifactorial pathogenesis is triggered by psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms that are influenced by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, altering the neurotransmitter or neuropathway functions of the brain, e.g., the serotoninergic system. The psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms contribute to the development of physical, psychological and behavioural symptoms, which are also influenced by the combined presence of other physiological (genetical background, metabolic and chronic inflammatory processes, chronobiological and circadian disorders) and psychological stressors and their interaction.A premenstruális szindróma (PMS) a reproduktív életkorú nők egyik leggyakoribb problémája világszerte a fájdalmas menstruáció és a nemi szervi gyulladások mellett. A fizikai, mentális és magatartásbeli tünetek a ciklus lutealis fázisában jelentkeznek visszatérően, és életminőség-romlást okoznak, befolyásolva a páciens szociális, munkahelyi és családi kapcsolatait. A tünetekre jellemző, hogy pár nap alatt a menstruáció kezdete után spontán eltűnnek. A PMS súlyos formája a pszichiátriában diagnosztizált és kezelt premenstruális dysphoriás zavar (PMDD). A multifaktoriális kóreredetű PMS megjelenését és súlyosságát a hypothalamus–hypophysis–ovarium tengely ciklikus működésének hatására kialakuló pszichoneuroendokrin mechanizmusok indítják el, megváltoztatva az agy neurotranszmitter- vagy neuropeptid-funkcióit, például a szerotoninerg rendszer működését. A pszichoneuroendokrin mechanizmusok hozzájárulnak a fizikai, a pszichológiai és a viselkedésbeli tünetek kialakulásához, melyeket befolyásol még az egyéb fiziológiai (például genetikai háttér, metabolikus és krónikus gyulladásos folyamatok, kronobiológiai és cirkadián működészavarok), illetve pszichikai stresszorok együttes jelenléte, illetve azok egymásra való kölcsönhatása is.

Elaborating on previous theoretical models for anxiety disorders, sleep disorders and dreaming, this study introduces a cognitive model of recurrent nightmares, the central element of which concerns representation of the nightmare’s repetitive storyline in the memory as a script. It is suggested that activation of this script during REM sleep results in a replay of the nightmare, and that activation occurs through perceived similarity between dream elements and the nightmare script. The model proposes a central role for cognitive processes in the persistence of nightmares over time. The success of cognitive-behavioural treatments is explained and clinical implications are discussed.",

ILesults suggested that at some stage during childhood, particularly under 8 years of age, the majority of children with autism will experience sleep problems. These problems are likely to be severe in many cases and will generally include one or more of. extreme sleep latencies; lengthy periods of night waking; shortened night sleep; and early morning waking. Such problems may have some specificity for autism as they appear to be rare in non-handicapped children and in children with mild degrees of intellectual handicap. It is likely that sleep problems in early childhood are related to the severe social difl:culties present in autism and the consequent inability of these children to use social cues to synchronise their sleep/wake cycle. Continued sleep dilticulties at older ages and with higher IQ may also be related to arousal and anxiety factors.",

One-third of a person's life is devoted to sleeping, although few are aware of the many positive aspects of this activity. Two distinct types of sleep, REM and NREM, have been identified. A good night's rest is achieved when REM and NREM sleep alternate in a regular pattern. Disruptions to this cycle, whether they originate physiologically or psychologically, have been linked to a variety of health problems. Polysomnography (PSG) equipment is often used in sleep labs inside hospitals to perform sleep studies. A polysomnogram is an in-depth medical technique that records a patient's vital signs while they sleep and necessitates a hospital stay. Clinically, sleep apnea is defined as a breathing disease in which there are periodic pauses in breathing lasting 10 seconds or more that occur more than five times during the night. Sleep apnea may be classified as either Obstructive, Central, or Mixed. The prevalent sleep problem known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by the relaxation of muscles in the upper airway during sleep. The purpose of this study is to provide a technique for screening for Obstructive Sleep Apnea by analysing Heart Rate Variability of Electrocardiogram (ECG) data while the subject is asleep. The goals of this study are to create computational approaches for identifying OSA based on characteristics extracted from Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals derived from sleep electrocardiograms (ECGs). Physio Net's Apnea-ECG recordings serve as the source for the ECG data.",

In this condition there is a loss of the normal atonia of postural muscles that usually occurs in REM sleep [2]. It results in complex, vigorous, dream-enacting behaviours during REM sleep [3]. These typical behaviours have the potential to cause serious injury at night, particularly from falls.

The occurrence of partial or complete UA obstruction during sleep characterizes the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome. Breathing (respiration), which is mainly under a behavioral or voluntary control system during awakening, is essentially under a metabolic or automated control system during sleep. The contribution of the thoracic cage to the overall respiration remains the same during wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Considering the importance of the metabolic regulation in the control of respiration during sleep, one can easily speculate that any change in the ventilatory response to hypoxic or hypercapnic stimuli will increase the magnitude of nocturnal hypoventilation episodes. UA are usually patent throughout the respiratory cycle and they behave in a manner similar to that of a Starling resistance model where a collapsible segment (pharynx) is located between two noncollapsible segments.",

      "title": "Psychosocial Aspects of Sudden Death",
      "abstract": "Meaningful information was available on 26 patients who died suddenly in a 44,000 industrial population. The data, past illnesses, prodromal symptoms, and psychosocial information were obtained from the plant medical records, the private physicians, and mainly from direct interviews with the surviving next-of-kin, usually the wife. The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death.",

      "title": "Melatonin’s Benefits and Risks as a Therapy for Sleep Disturbances in the Elderly: Current Insights",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Aging is accompanied by circadian changes, including disruptive alterations in the sleep/wake cycle, as well as the beginning of low-degree inflammation (\"inflammaging\"), a scenario that leads to several chronic illnesses, including cancer, and metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurological dysfunctions. As a result, any effective approach to healthy aging must consider both the correction of circadian disturbance and the control of low-grade inflammation. One of the most important prerequisites for healthy aging is the preservation of robust circadian rhythmicity (particularly of the sleep/wake cycle). Sleep disturbance disrupts various activities in the central nervous system, including waste molecule elimination. Melatonin is a chemical with extraordinary phylogenetic conservation found in all known aerobic creatures whose alteration plays an important role in sleep changes with aging. Every day, the late afternoon/nocturnal surge in pineal melatonin helps to synchronize both the central circadian pacemaker found in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and a plethora of peripheral cellular circadian clocks. Melatonin is an example of an endogenous chronobiotic substance that can influence the timing and amplitude of circadian rhythms. Moreover, melatonin is also an excellent anti-inflammatory agent, buffering free radicals, down-regulating proinflammatory cytokines, and reducing insulin resistance, among other things. We present both scientific and clinical evidence that melatonin is a safe drug for treating sleep disturbances in the elderly. Keywords: melatonin, sleep, elderly, safety, neurodegeneration",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is the most common of disabling neurological conditions, and seizures are among the most common of neurological symptoms. Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

      "abstract": "Presently, a lot of data indicate that the disturbance of mechanisms underlying the regulation of sleep-waking cycle coincides with the mechanisms underlying the development of depression. The disturbance of circadian rhythms is one of the core factors in the genesis of the most affective disorders including depression, which indicates the role of the internal biological clock in the pathophysiology of affective disorders. The episodes of depression, mania or hypomania may result from the disturbances in endogenous biological timing. In this review, we have summarized the literature data obtained in animal models or in the patients with affective pathology, in which the connection between the function of sleep and depression was demonstrated. Specifically, we highlight the mechanisms underlying sleep dysfunction during depression (imbalance of circadian rhythms, melatonin metabolism and mechanisms of neuroinflammatory dysregulation) and provide an evidence for the link between sleep function and depression (sleep disturbances during depressive episodes, the effects of pharmacotherapy, chronotherapy, the effect of sleep deprivation, comorbidity of obstructive sleep apnea and depression).",

Complaints of insomnia are categorized into difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, unwanted early morning awakenings, and non-restorative sleep often with daytime consequences such as excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue. Factors that interfere with the opportunity to obtain sufficient sleep include other sleep disorders, substance use, shift work, or the presence of another psychiatric disorder. As one moves from middle age to the later years of life, the aging process creates changes in sleep architecture and continuity that increase the vulnerability to developing chronic insomnia. Research indicates that some crucial interventions that buffer against chronic insomnia may help the older adult to adopt a regular daily schedule, a healthier lifestyle and sleep behaviors, and increase the quality of social interactions and physical activity.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

Επίσης, τα αυξημένα επίπεδα άγχους αποτελούν μία κοινή συννοσηρότητα σε πολλές διαταραχές, ελαττώνοντας την ποιότητα της ζωής των ατόμων αυτών. Η έντονη συνέκφραση κοινωνικών ελλειμάτων και άγχους υποδηλώνει ότι οι δύο αυτές παθολογίες μοιράζονται κοινούς νευροβιολογικούς μηχανισμούς και εγκεφαλικά νευρικά δίκτυα, τα οποία όμως παραμένουν σε μεγάλο βαθμό ασαφή. Η ανισορροπία μεταξύ Διέγερσης/Αναστολής, σε διάφορες φλοιϊκές και υπο-φλοιϊκές περιοχές του Δικτύου Λήψης Κοινωνικών Αποφάσεων καθώς και τα αυξημένα επίπεδα νευροφλεγμονής έχουν προταθεί ως κοινοί αιτιολογικοί μηχανισμοί που εμπλέκονται στην εκδήλωση και των δύο παθολογιών. Επίσης, η συμβολή άλλων συστημάτων νευροδιαβίβασης, όπως του νοραδρενεργικού και του ενδοκανναβινοειδούς συστήματος, καθώς και ο ρόλος της ενήλικης νευρογένεσης παραμένουν σε μεγάλο βαθμό ασαφή. Παλαιότερες μελέτες του εργαστηρίου μας έχουν καταδείξει τα υψηλά επίπεδα έκφρασης αδρενεργικών υποδοχέων καθώς και την ύπαρξη σημαντικού ρυθμού νευρογένεσης, εντός του SDMN ζεβροϊχθύων, προτείνοντας την πιθανή συμβολή τους στη συν-εκδήλωση των δύο αυτών παθολογιών.Τα αποτελέσματα της παρούσας διδακτορικής διατριβής υποστηρίζουν ότι η ανισορροπία μεταξύ γλουταμινεργικής και GABAεργικής νευροδιαβίβασης καθώς και η δυσλειτουργία της ενδοκανναβινοειδούς σηματοδότησης που παρατηρείται στον εγκέφαλο ζεβροϊχθύων, οι οποίοι χαρακτηρίζονται από υπολειτουργία των NMDA υποδοχέων, διαδραματίζουν σημαντικό ρόλο κατά την εκδήλωση των κοινωνικών ελλειμάτων και των αυξημένων επιπέδων άγχους. Επίσης, τα αυξημένα επίπεδα έκφρασης της προ-φλεγμονώδους κυτοκίνης IL-1β, σε νευρικά η αστρογλοιακά κύτταρα εντός συγκεκριμένων κόμβων του SDMN, αναδεικνύουν τον κρίσιμο ρόλο των νευρο-φλεγμονωδών αποκρίσεων κατά την συν-εκδήλωση των παραπάνω διαταραχών. Πιο συγκεκριμένα, βάσει των αποτελεσμάτων μας προτείνουμε ότι μεταβολές στην γλουταμινεργική νευροδιαβίβαση εμπλέκονται στην εκδήλωση των κοινωνικών ελλειμάτων ενώ η GABAεργική και ενδοκανναβινοειδής δυσλειτουργία συσχετίζεται θετικά με την αγχώδη συμπεριφορά. Αντιθέτως, τα αυξημένα επίπεδα έκφρασης της IL-1β συνδέονται και με τις δύο συμπεριφορικές καταστάσεις.Όσο αφορά την κατεχολαμινεργική νευροδιαβίβαση, τα αποτελέσματά μας καταδεικνύουν την ύπαρξη αυξημένων επιπέδων έκφρασης του μεταφορέα της ντοπαμίνης και των β2-αδρενενεργικών υποδοχέων (β2-ARs) στον τελεγκέφαλο ζεβροϊχθύων που χαρακτηρίζονται από συμπεριφορά κοινωνικής αποφυγής και αυξημένα επίπεδα άγχους. Μάλιστα, είναι ενδιαφέρον ότι η έκφραση των β2-ARs ρυθμίζεται διαφορετικά εντός διαφορετικών περιοχών του SDMN, παρουσιάζοντας αυξημένα επίπεδα στον κοιλιακό πυρήνα του κοιλιακού τελεγκεφάλου (Vv) και μειωμένη έκφραση στον έσω πυρήνα του ραχιαίου τελεγκεφάλου (Dm) καθώς και στον πρόσθιο φυματικό πυρήνα (ATN). Επιπλέον, ο εντοπισμός των β2-ARs σε GABAεργικά και/ή mGluR5+ κύτταρα, υποστηρίζει τον πιθανό ρυθμιστικό ρόλο των β2-ARs κατά την συνέκφραση των ελλειμάτων στην κοινωνική συμπεριφορά και των αυξημένων επιπέδων άγχους, ρυθμίζοντας την ισορροπία μεταξύ διέγερσης/αναστολής. Tέλος, προτείνουμε ότι μεταβολές της δομικής πλαστικότητας και ειδικότερα της ενήλικης νευρογένεσης, σε περιοχές του ραχιαίου και κοιλιακού τελεγκεφάλου, όπως προκύπτει από τις μεταβολές του προτύπου του κυτταρικού πολλαπλασιασμού και επιβίωσης των νευρικών βλαστικών κυττάρων, χαρακτηρίζει την συμπεριφορά κοινωνικής αποφυγής και τα αυξημένα επίπεδα άγχους των ζεβροϊχθύων. Συνοψίζοντας, τα ευρήματα της παρούσας διατριβής προτείνουν ότι η υπολειτουργία των NMDA υποδοχέων και η επακόλουθη πρόκληση ανισορροπίας μεταξύ Διέγερσης/Αναστολής, εντός περιοχών του SDMN, σχετίζεται με τα σοβαρά ελλείμματα στην κοινωνική συμπεριφορά και τα αυξημένα επίπεδα άγχους που εμφανίζουν οι ζεβροϊχθύες. Επιπρόσθετα, οι μεταβολές στην κατεχολαμινεργική και ενδοκανναβινοειδή σηματοδότηση, τα αυξημένα επίπεδα νευροφλεγμονής και οι μεταβολές του προτύπου της ενήλικης νευρογένεσης, πιθανόν συνεισφέρουν στη συννοσηρότητα των παραπάνω παθολογιών. Τα αποτελέσματά μας επομένως αναδεικνύουν την ύπαρξη επιπρόσθετων νευροβιολογικών μηχανισμών και περιοχών που εμπλέκονται στην εκδήλωση των κοινωνικών ελλειμμάτων και των αυξημένων επιπέδων άγχους, έπειτα από υπολειτουργία των NMDA υποδοχέων, παρέχοντας νέους πιθανούς στόχους για την ανάπτυξη πιο αποτελεσματικών και στοχευμένων θεραπευτικών προσεγγίσεων με στόχο την υποχώρηση των παραπάνω συμπτωμάτων.",

      "title": "Night Shift Naps Improve Patient and Workforce Safety",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is the body’s natural response to sleep loss.1 Interruption in the quantity or quality of sleep affects fatigue,2 which in turn disrupts physical and cognitive functioning. Fatigue not only impairs attention to detail, ability to remain focused, information processing/judgment, and problem-solving, but also memory, reaction time, motivation, communication, mood, and empathy.3–5Many factors contribute to fatigue. Topping the list are staffing and workload demands, scheduling (ie, shift length, rotations, consecutive and overtime shifts), and personal issues such as habits and family responsibilities.2,6 In particular, extended shifts (&gt; 8 hours) have been associated with greater fatigue, drowsiness at work, and need for recovery.7,8 Fatigued nurses are at higher risk of making errors6,9,10 (risk increases 3-fold if shifts are &gt; 12.5 hours),11 burnout,12 and work-related injuries and accidents.10 Patient satisfaction also suffers.12 In another systematic review of 21 studies,8 as shift lengthened, adverse outcomes for patients increased (eg, hypoglycemic events, pneumonia, death), and nurses experienced more occupational injuries such as needle stick and musculoskeletal injuries, health complaints, drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes or near crashes.8 In an attempt to assess a countermeasure for fatigue, the PICO (patient/problem, intervention, comparison, outcome) question of interest for this evidence synthesis was, What effect do strategic naps have on sleep and cognitive/psychomotor outcomes of nurses?The search strategy involved CINAHL and MEDLINE. Key words were fatigue, nurses, health care workers, hospitals, and napping. The search was limited to the past 10 years.Ten original research studies were retrieved (Table 1): 3 qualitative, 1 participatory action, 2 descriptive, 1 quasi-experimental, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 1 systematic review. All studies examined the effects of naps on hospital nurses working the night shift, except for the systematic review, which related to shift workers across industries. In most instances, a single nap was studied, but researchers in one study22 examined nightly naps over 3 consecutive nights. Length of naps varied from 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes to 1, 2, and 3 hours. Nap times were highly variable from midnight to 1 am, 2 am to 3 am, and 4 am to 4:30 am.As outlined in Table 1, quantitative and qualitative studies validated that strategic naps rejuvenate nurses. More than 50% of nurses who napped in one study13 could sleep (albeit lightly). Sleep latency, or time to fall asleep, was shortest for nurses who napped from 2 am to 3 am.16 But some nurses had difficulty calming down and unplugging because they wanted to stay informed as patient care was top priority.21 If unable to nap, nurses reported that 4 am to 6 am was the most difficult period for drowsiness.18Nappers reported feeling “energized” and “refreshed,”13,18,21 and sleep inertia (ie, drowsiness and impaired cognitive/psychomotor performance upon awakening) occurred less often.13,18 Another study demonstrated physiological signs of reduced tension from sleeping, including changes in bispectral measures, body temperature, heart rate variability, and activity level.15 Sleep outcomes from napping included less subjective and behavioral signs of sleepiness, and increased vigor.16,19,22 Scott et al19 found that the amount of sleep on workdays improved by 50 minutes on average, and sleep quality improved significantly at 12 weeks. Compared with those who did not nap, nappers also experienced fewer performance lapses, better probed memory recall, faster reaction times, less drowsy driving and better driving performance, faster psychomotor skills during intravenous catheter insertion, and fewer errors or near errors.16,19,22 Intercepted or discovered errors increased because of higher alertness.Most of the evidence for strategic napping to combat detrimental effects of fatigue is level C evidence (Table 2). Strategic naps were rejuvenating with favorable cognitive and psychomotor functions, which led to fewer errors. The timing and duration of naps are important. Naps that occur after the middle of the night (but before 4 am)18,24 promoted better sleep quality and were associated with greater physiological benefit and psychomotor performance. Naps should also not last more than 1 hour25 to prevent sleep inertia, or 30 minutes should be allowed for recovery.18,22Several implications must be considered when developing strategic napping programs. Educating nurses about the effects of fatigue and good self-care—including taking naps before working a night shift or a prolonged stretch—is essential.2 The need for this education to be a higher priority was demonstrated by a recent survey24 where most nurse leaders indicated that their facilities did not educate either managers or staff on risk management issues related to fatigue.26A second consideration relates to assessing the conduciveness of the environment for sleeping. Good quality sleep is more likely if nurses can take a duty-free break with uninterrupted coverage of their responsibilities.2 Nurses in a qualitative study18 provided many reasons for their inabilities to nap— from understaffing to unstable patients. When staffing is an issue, Geiger-Brown et al13 advocated that naps should be offered to nurses with (1) self-perceived sleepiness or shiftwork sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea, insomnia), (2) commutes more than 20 minutes or on rural roads, and (3) rotating (vs fixed) shifts, especially those working their first shift or more than 3 in a row.In addition to acuity and staffing issues, Fallis et al18 reported other barriers to napping. These barriers centered on lack of comfortable spaces, interruptions due to shared space, and fear of sleep inertia. In a recent survey of critical care managers, only 11% reported that a specific nap room was available.27 In another study,20 nurses were challenged by the lack of a predefined nap time and consistent ability to take time to rest. Because of these challenges, nurses have shared preferences such as desire for a staff-exclusive area close to the unit (but separate from break rooms) that offers low lighting, pillows and blankets, timers, and either beds, couches, stretchers, or reclining chairs.18,21 Eye masks and ear plugs also may be helpful.2To compound these challenges, cultural barriers exist. Nurse managers in one study18 were surprised by the ease of implementing a napping program, but they stated that the professional/organizational culture and staff’s perceptual dissonance about the adequacy of staffing affected their ability to take restful breaks. Indeed, staff nurses and managers themselves have alluded to lack of support for napping from managers and senior leaders.18,27 Many nurses are reticent to take naps5 and feel guilty if they do.21 In a current survey, Steege et al26 found that although most nurse leaders recognized fatigue as a significant practice concern with negative consequences, most believed that stigma surrounds acknowledging fatigue because it is “part of the culture of nursing.” Thus, leaders concluded that these social norms have slowed the triggering of organizational priorities toward developing fatigue-management policies that include napping, as advocated for by the American Nurses Association.28Fatigue.

A person with bipolar disorder cycles between these mood episodes throughout his or her lifetime, leading to significant impairment in functioning and overall quality of life. Sleep disturbances pervade the course of bipolar disorder, occurring before, during, and after mood episodes. Sleep disturbances also negatively impact the treatment outcome for individuals with bipolar disorder. Thus, interventions aimed at improving sleep in this clinical population are needed. This chapter discusses sleep disturbances in the context of bipolar disorder as well as empirically validated strategies to improve sleep specifically for bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Chronobiologie de la vigilance Approche d'application dans le domaine de la sécurité routière",
      "abstract": "La chronobiologie a pour objet l'étude des rythmes biologiques, dont ceux de la vigilance et des performances. En neurophysiologie, la vigilance est définie par des niveaux d'activation du système nerveux soumis à des variations de type circadien, ultradien et circasémidien au cours du nycthémère. L'analyse du rythme de la vigilance chez l'homme montre que les épisodes d'hypovigilance apparaissent à des horaires prévisibles de la journée. L'erreur humaine liée à une baisse de la vigilance au volant est une des principales causes des accidents routiers. Ces derniers présentent un rythme de périodicité de 24 h avec des pics et des creux à des heures déterminées. Le maximum de risque coïncide avec les horaires du pic minimum de la vigilance, en milieu d'après-midi, tard la nuit et tôt le matin. Ces horaires sont compatibles avec le profil circadien de la somnolence. Les principales causes favorisant ces accidents sont les troubles du sommeil, l'ingestion d'alcool et la prise de médicaments psychotropes. La prise en compte des données chronobiologiques peut améliorer la sécurité en proposant des solutions d'adaptation des horaires de travail aux variations circadiennes des capacités fonctionnelles de l'opérateur humain. La détermination des horaires de meilleure performance de l'opérateur humain et leur concordance avec ses horaires de travail permet d'améliorer sa fiabilité et de réduire ainsi le risque d'accident. Cet article présente dans un premier temps une étude bibliographique sur les concepts relatifs à la chronobiologie de la vigilance et des performances, en soulignant l'apport et les limites des mesures préconisées pour détecter et prévenir l'hypovigilance du conducteur. Il propose ensuite une démarche méthodologique d'application de la chronobiologie de la vigilance au domaine de la sécurité du transport routier, qui s'articule autour de sept grandes étapes complémentaires. Chronobiology is the study of biological rhythms, including those of alertness and performance. Neurophysiologists define alertness in terms of levels of activation of the nervous system which is subject to circadian, ultradian and circasemidian variations during the nycthemeron. Study of the rhythm of human alertness has shown that episodes of low alertness occur at foreseeable times of the day. Human error caused by reduced alertness while driving is one of the main causes of road traffic accidents, which exhibit a rhythm with a periodicity of 24 hours with peaks and troughs at fixed times. The highest risks coincide with the lowest levels of alertness, and these occur in the mid-afternoon, late at night, and early in the morning. These times of day are compatible with the circadian pattern of sleepiness. The main factors that increase the likelihood of accidents are sleep disturbances, alcohol ingestion and the taking of psychotropic drugs. Chronobiological data can be used to improve safety if it provides solutions that adapt working hours to circadian variations and the functional capacities of the human operator. Determining the times when human operator performance is at its best and making working hours compatible with them provides a means of improving the human operator's reliability and therefore reduces accident risk. This paper begins with a literature survey concerning the concepts of the chronobiology of alertness and performance, and stresses the potential and limits of the recommended measures for detecting and preventing low driver alertness. It then proposes a methodological approach for applying the chronobiology of alertness in the area of road transport safety, which is based seven complementary stages.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is characterized by dream-enacting behaviours (e.g. punching, shouting, jumping out of bed, etc.) linked to unpleasant dreams (e.g. being attacked or robbed) and excessive electromyographic activity during REM sleep. Accurate diagnosis of RBD requires a history of abnormal sleep behaviours and nocturnal video-polysomnographic (VPSG) demonstration of prominent tonic and/or phasic electromyographic activity associated with abnormal vocal and motor manifestations in REM sleep. VPSG is required because dream-enacting behaviours resembling those typically seen in RBD may occur in people affected by obstructive sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder, visual hallucinations, isolated nightmares, confusional awakenings in demented subjects and more rarely by somnambulism and nocturnal epilepsy. Patients with Parkinson’s disease, particularly when associated with dementia, had non-RBD episodes of sleep-enactment behaviours occurring upon arousals from either REM or non-REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "The human circadian system is normally synchronised with the solar day, insuring that alertness and performance peak during daytime hours and consolidated sleep occurs during the night. In circadian rhythm sleep disorders, the pattern of sleep-wake is misaligned with the patient's circadian system or the external environment, resulting in insomnia, fatigue, and deterioration in performance. Appropriately-timed exposure to bright light can reset the timing of sleep and wake to the desired times, and improve sleep quality and daytime alertness. The efficacy of bright light therapy, however, is dependent on the time-of-day of the circadian cycle that the light is administered. In this article, we examine the physiological basis for bright light therapy, and we discuss the application of light in the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders including advanced and delayed sleep-phase disorder, free-running disorder (nonentrained type), shiftwork disorder and jet lag disorder. We review the laboratory and field studies which have established bright light therapy as an effective treatment for sleep-wake and circadian misalignment, and we also provide guidelines for the appropriate timing and safe use of bright light therapy.",

Hypersomnolence disorder is more due to yang deficiency rather than yin deficiency and it’s major pattern is spleen-kidney yang deficiency. Cataplexy is main feature in narcolepsy and corresponds to depressive psychosis or fainting in terms of Korean Medicine and narcolepsy is assumed to be relevant to liver wind. Breathing-related sleep disorders are related with phlegm-fluid retention brought on spleen deficiency with dampness encumbrance. Pattern of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders is combined with yin deficiency of liver-kidney or liver qi depression of insomnia disorder and spleen-kidney yang deficiency or dampness-phlegm of hypersomnolence disorder. Yin deficiency with effulgent fire brought on drugs or alcohol is one of main patterns of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder and combined patterns with yin deficiency of liver-kidney and blood stasis or dampness-phlegm-heat are mostly applied clinically.

By reviewing various epidemiological studies, relationships among some chronic diseases and depression have been noted. The depression-disease order of appearance can de bi-directional. It seems that stress, depression and inflammation have the capacity to affect the balance of cykotines produced by the immunological system. Modulation of the immunological system by the central nervous system is controIled/mediada by a complex bi-directional network composed of signals among the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immunological system. The most frequent diseases related to depression are chronic but some are acute: of the central nervous system, endocrines, infections. Chronic pain also seems related to this problem. Pain, fatigue or tiredness are considered symptoms of a hidden depression and others, physical as well as psychiatric, could be algias, parestesias, headaches, vertigo, or gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory neurodegenerative disorders.",

A good night’s rest and a stable sleep-wake rhythm are therefore very\nimportant. The sleep-wake rhythm is regulated by several brain structures. People\nwith an intellectual disability (ID) all have some form of brain dysfunction, and might\ntherefore be at risk for sleep disturbances.[1-2] During the process of ageing, brain\nstructures that are important in regulating the sleep-wake rhythm show functional deterioration,[\n3] resulting in for example waking up too early in the morning and daytime\nsleepiness. Also, the architecture of night sleep changes, leading to a decreased ability\nto initiate and maintain sleep.[4]\nAs a result of a combination of pre-existent brain damage and the age-related\nchanges, older adults with ID might be extra vulnerable to develop sleep-wake rhythm\ndisturbances. Until now no epidemiological research has been performed on this\ntopic in this population. Because life expectancy nowadays has increased in people\nwith ID, knowledge about night sleep and the sleep-wake rhythm is of importance for\noptimal care in this population. Also, for both epidemiological research and individual\ndiagnostics of sleep problems, an objective tool to investigate sleep that is suitable for\nolder adults with ID, is needed.\nIn this chapter, after some background information on intellectual disability, sleep\nregulation and ageing, we will introduce the Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disabilities\nstudy and the selected method to investigate sleep and the sleep-wake rhythm in\nthat study, followed by the aims and outline of this thesis.",

      "abstract": "There are three fundamental principles for understanding sleep; the sleeping brain is not a resting brain, the sleeping brain functions in a different manner from the waking brain and the activity and work of the sleeping brain are purposeful. The sleeping brain does fail and this failure is manifest in a variety of clinical symptoms; all sleep complaints should be taken seriously and investigated. Transient insomnia is uniformly associated with objective sleep disturbances which have been documented following phase shifts of the major sleep period such as that caused by transmeridian travel. However, the degree to which the individual responds to these factors is variable. There is a consensus that sleep medications are indicated for transient and short-term insomnia. Benzodiazepine hypnotics are commonly used to induce and maintain sleep, and improve daytime alertness.",

Transient symptoms of depersonalization or derealization lasting a few moments to a few hours are commonly experienced by most people at some point in their lives. The DSM-5 criteria for dissociative identity disorder requires the presence of two or more distinct personality states that is observed or self-reported and that results in disruption or discontinuity in the sense of self, and is accompanied by changes in affect, behavior, cognition, perception, consciousness, memory, or sensory-motor functioning. Dissociative amnesia involves the inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, and often follows a traumatic or stressful life event.",

      "abstract": "The papers in this special section are the proceedings of a symposium on chronobiology and mood disorders presented at the June 1999 meeting of the Canadian College of Neuropsychopharmacology in Halifax, Nova Scotia. These papers review aspects of mood disorders that are linked to biological rhythms with 3 different periodicities: daily, menstrual and annual. They also reflect a growing interest in mechanisms regulating physiological rhythmicity on a variety of time scales and in the impact of normal and pathologic function of these mechanisms on psychiatric illnesses. Rhythms are related to mood disorders in several different ways. First, some conditions are expressed cyclically; that is, they have a period linked to an identified internal or external periodicity, such as menstrual and annual rhythms of dysphoria or depression. Other conditions, such as many cases of bipolar illness, express cycles that are not tied to any identified periodic stimulus. A second connection between rhythms and mood disorders is the alteration of daily rhythms, in particular sleep and waking, in mood disorders. Finally, the systems responsible for the generation or synchronization of normal rhythms may be involved in the etiology of mood disorders, as has sometimes been proposed, for example, for bipolar illness and for seasonal affective disorders. Connections between psychiatric disorders and biological rhythms were reviewed more than 40 years ago in a landmark monograph by Curt Paul Richter, whose innovative concepts and studies gave birth to many fields of psychobiological research, as well as establishing key concepts and analytic methods for the study of biological rhythms. Richter’s 1965 monograph Biological Clocks in Medicine and Psychiatry presented material from two 1959 Salmon Lectures to the New York Academy of Medicine. It serves as a benchmark for assessing the developments in this area of research over the last few decades.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is an active and regulated process with restorative functions for physical and mental conditions. Based on recordings of brain waves and the analysis of characteristic patterns and waveforms it is possible to distinguish wakefulness and five sleep stages. Sleep and the sleep stages modulate autonomous nervous system functions such as body temperature, respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate. These functions consist of a sympathetic tone usually related to activation and to parasympathetic (or vagal) tone usually related to inhibition. Methods of statistical physics are used to analyze heart rate and respiration to detect changes of the autonomous nervous system during sleep. Detrended fluctuation analysis and synchronization analysis and their applications to heart rate and respiration during sleep in healthy subjects and patients with sleep disorders are presented. The observed changes can be used to distinguish sleep stages in healthy subjects as well as to differentiate normal and disturbed sleep on the basis of heart rate and respiration recordings without direct recording of brain waves. Of special interest are the cardiovascular consequences of disturbed sleep because they present a risk factor for cardiovascular disorders such as arterial hypertension, cardiac ischemia, sudden cardiac death, and stroke. New derived variables can help to find indicators for these health risks.",

Sleep disturbances are also frequently reported following TBI, and may contribute to fatigue. Fatigue may also limit energy for social interactions and/or recreational pursuits, resulting in withdrawal, greater time spent at home and consequent social isolation. Fatigue may be a symptom of depression and depression in turn may cause sleep disruption and fatigue. Fatigue may be associated with muscle weakness or other changes or injuries in the peripheral nervous system. The subjective experience of fatigue is likely to be determined by the complex interaction of functional disability with lifestyle demands, which is difficult to quantify and idiosyncratic. Like fatigue, sleep disturbances have also been associated with pain, depression and anxiety. Bright Light Therapy represents another potential treatment for fatigue and daytime sleepiness.",

      "title": "Los factores psicosociales como predictores pronósticos de difícil retorno laboral tras incapacidad",
      "abstract": "espanolSe esta incapacitado laboralmente, por estar enfermo y presentar limitaciones funcionales que afectan a la capacidad laboral y que impiden trabajar. Los factores psicosociales son determinantes en la salud de la poblacion y por tanto determinantes en la enfermedad y el enfermar de la poblacion trabajadora. Los factores psicosociales son factores precipitantes en el inicio de la incapacidad, son factores de mantenimiento de la incapacidad ligados a la cronificacion de los procesos de incapacidad, condicionan la mala respuesta y la adherencia terapeutica, suponen barreras al retorno laboral, y pueden ser causa de presentismo laboral (estar presente en el trabajo, en malas condiciones por temor a perder el empleo). Los factores psicosociales son predictores del retorno al trabajo. Puesto que se trata de factores previos a la declaracion de la incapacidad conviene conocerlos para prevenir la aparicion de la incapacidad y su mantenimiento que determina un no retorno laboral o su postergacion, tanto en la incapacidad temporal como permanente. Los factores psicosociales no causan la incapacidad pero pueden precipitarla, mantenerla o modificarla, terminando por condicionar la capacidad/incapacidad laboral. En un estudio de seguimiento de procesos de baja que alcanzaron los 365 dias, los factores psicosociales estaban presentes en un 23% de forma significativa. Material y metodo: se revisaron hasta mayo de 2017 las siguientes bases de datos bibliograficas: SciELO, PUBMED, asi como estudio de factores psicosociales en presentes en procesos de baja que llegaron a 365 dias. Conclusiones: Los factores psicosociales estan en el inicio de la baja como detonante impeditivo laboral de situaciones basales previas. Estan en la cronificacion del proceso una vez que la incapacidad se ha producido, estan en la percepcion del paciente de persistencia sintomatologica y de escasa respuesta al tratamiento, conllevan una percepcion de mala evolucion de su proceso de incapacidad, potencian lo disfuncional discapacitante y dificultan el retorno laboral. Si permanecen no resueltos y se produce el retorno al trabajo seran causan de bajo rendimiento laboral, pudiendo ser determinante de “ineptitud sobrevenida” y despido. Por todo ello, es capital la identificacion temprana y la prevencion de estos factores psicosociales para aminorar el absentismo por incapacidad. Las siguientes medidas reduciran el impacto de los factores psicologicos en la incapacidad temporal: actuar sobre las respuestas emocionales inadecuadas mediante atencion psicologica. Atencion temprana de los procesos osteomusculares y psiquicos. Evitar listas de espera para pruebas diagnosticas y para tratamientos. Consideracion preventiva de las decisiones de alta medica. Incorporacion parcial al trabajo (altas parciales) tras incapacidad. Facilitar la adaptacion laboral ante la “actitud sobrevenida” del trabajador reincorporado. Evitar controversias entre alta medica y no apto, con concordancia decisoria. Horarios flexibles o reduccion horaria que favorezcan la conciliacion familiar. Prestaciones sociales para la atencion a familiares con dependencia o gravemente enfermos. Mayor deteccion y proteccion de los factores psicosociales en el trabajo. Mejoras en la organizacion, condiciones y clima laboral, que fomenten la satisfaccion laboral. EnglishOne may be incapacitated for work for being ill and presenting functional limitations that affect the work capacity preventing him/her from work. Psychosocial factors are decisive in the health of the population and therefore decisive in both the disease itself and in the fact of working population getting sick. These psychosocial factors are precipitating factors at the onset of disability.They are factors that keep the incapacity active which linked to the chronification of the incapacity processes they condition the poor response and the therapeutic adherence. They imply barriers to return to work, and may cause presenteeism (being present at work in poor conditions for fear of losing employment). Psychosocial factors are predictors of returning to work. Since they are initial factors to the declaration of the incapacity it is necessary to know them well to prevent the appearance and maintenance that determine a non-return labor or its postponement, either in the temporary or permanent incapacity. Psychosocial factors do not cause disability but can precipitate it, maintain it or modify it, ending up by conditioning the capacity / incapacity for work. Psychosocial factors were present in a significant 23% in a follow-up study of medical leave processes that reached up to 365 days. Material and method: the following bibliographic databases were searched up to May 2017: SciELO, PUBMED, as well as the psychosocial factors study appeared in low processes up to 365 days. Conclusions: The psychosocial factors are at the beginning of the sick leave as a preventive labor trigger of previous baseline situations. They are in the chronification process once the disability has occurred; they are in the patient’s perception of symptom persistence and poor response to treatment; they imply a perception of poor evolution of their incapacitation process, enhance the dysfunctional disabling and hinder the return to work. Unresolved and still returning to work will be cause of low work performance, being able to be determinant of “ineptitude overdue” and dismissed. For theses reasons it is important to early identify and prevent these psychosocial factors in order to reduce absenteeism due to disability. The following measures will reduce the impact of psychological factors on temporary disability: acting on inadequate emotional responses through psychological care; taking an early attention to musculoskeletal and psychic processes; avoiding the waiting lists for the diagnostic tests and treatments; having a preventive consideration of return-to-work decisions; taking a partial incorporation to work (high partial fit notecertified sickness episodes) after incapacity; facilitating the work adaptation to the “overcoming attitude” of the returned worker; avoiding disputes reaching decisive agreements between medically discharged and unfit; providing flexible hours or reduced hours that favor family reconciliation; receiving social care benefits for the dependents or acutely ill family members’ attention; having a greater detection and protection of psychosocial factors at work and improving the organization, conditions and working climate promoting the satisfaction labor.",

Factors influencing the increased risk of hearing loss relate, for example, to abortion, older age, too frequent exposure to noise. Hearing loss usually occurs gradually. Symptoms that may indicate hearing loss are buzzing or tinnitus, dizziness, balance problems, ear pain, or a feeling of a foreign object. It is important to check the hearing in newborns in order to react in time to possible irregularities. Symptoms of deafness in a child occur in the form of non-response to sounds and lack of interest in musical toys. Children between the ages of 8 and 12 months will not respond to their name in case of hearing loss, and the absence of speech is possible",

      "abstract": "L'oeil est un organe sensoriel complexe qui rassemble des informations sur notre environnement. Il peut etre modelise par un ensemble : diaphragme, lentille convergente et ecran. Les troubles de l'accommodation representent un effet indesirable oculaire, souvent mentionne dans les resumes des caracteristiques des medicaments. Ils peuvent se manifester de plusieurs facons, allant d'un simple inconfort en vision de loin ou de pres a des symptomes plus marques tels qu'une fatigue oculaire ou des cephalees. On definit les troubles de l'accommodation soit par : -­ Une perte ou une paralysie de l'accommodation qui s'explique par une gene ou une incapacite a lire de pres sans correction. Il s'agit d'une atteinte du muscle ciliaire et/ou a une mydriase par stimulation du nerf sympathique ou par inhibition du systeme parasympathique. -­ Un spasme d'accommodation a l'origine d'une myopie transitoire. Cela s'explique par la contraction permanente du muscle ciliaire et s'associe, en cas d'origine medicamenteuse, a un myosis par stimulation excessive du systeme parasympathique. Les medicaments parasympathomimetiques induisent ainsi un myosis actif, et les medicaments parasympatholytiques une mydriase passive. A l'inverse, les medicaments sympathomimetiques alpha-­adrenergiques provoquent une mydriase active, et les medicaments sympatholytiques alpha-­adrenergiques un myosis passif. Le but de ce travail a ete de faire l'etat des lieux bibliographique le plus large possible des medicaments a l'origine des troubles de l'accommodation. Cela permet d'apprehender les familles therapeutiques couramment decrites comme pourvoyeuses de troubles de l'accommodation et d'utilisation tres diverse (antihistaminiques, neuroleptiques, antiparkinsoniens, anticancereux, antidiabetiques, etc…), mais aussi d'autres molecules moins decrites. Le pharmacien est un acteur important dans la prise en charge des patients. Il permet, grâce a ses conseils, d'accompagner le patient en matiere d'effets indesirables et de lui signaler leur survenue eventuelle en matiere de vision. Afin de mieux maitriser les risques de troubles de l'accommodation, le pharmacien doit garder une formation continue, et etre vigilant quant aux risques que comporte chaque molecule commercialisee.",

The International Classication of Sleep Disorders 2nd edition (ICSD-2) denes EDS as “the inability to stay awake and alert during major waking episodes of the day, resulting into unintended lapses into drowsiness or sleep” [1]. Hypersomnia can contribute to poor general health, social outcomes and learning difculties in children (2). Sleep disorders in this category include narcolepsy and its variants, idiopathic hypersomnia with and without long sleep time, behaviorally induced insufcient sleep syndrome, and recurrent hypersomnia typied by Klein-Levin syndrome. This category also includes hypersomnia due to substance abuse and medical conditions, such as obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, epilepsy, depression, head trauma and brain tumors (3). Since hypersomnia has a subjective interpretation, it could be mistaken as tiredness or fatigue, thus presenting a diagnostic challenge.",

      "abstract": "espanolEl denominado Sindrome de Latigazo Cervical (SLC) es una mecanismo lesional que acontece en la colision de vehiculos a motor, al producirse una forzada extension o flexion del cuello y una violenta oscilacion de la cabeza de delante hacia atras o de atras hacia delante unido a movimientos de lateralidad y torsion forzada del cuello. En consecuencia no debemos interpretar el latigazo cervical como una lesion o sindrome, sino como un mecanismo lesional que da lugar a diferentes lesiones segun los casos. El SLC es una patologia muy frecuente en las consultas de Atencion Primaria y tambien en las de los medicos evaluadores de discapacidades. Asociado a este mecanismo patogenico del latigazo existe un amplio espectro de signos y sintomas De todas estas consecuencias la alteracion de la postura cervical y del rango de movimiento (ROM) son dos de las mas habituales en las consultas despues de un latigazo cervical. La rectificacion cervical ademas de dar lugar a postura de cabeza adelantada, puede ser una de las principales causas de los sintomas ya que a menor angulo craneo-vertebral mayor severidad en el dolor cervical y mayor incapacidad funcional. EnglishWhiplash is an injury mechanism that occurs in the collision of motor vehicles, when there is a forced extension or flexion of the neck and a violent oscillation of the head from front to back or from back to front together with lateral movements and forced twisting of the neck. Consequently, we should not interpret whiplash as an injury or syndrome, but rather as an injury mechanism that gives rise to different injuries depending on the case. Whiplash is a very common pathology in Primary Care and also in disability evaluating physicians. Associated with this pathogenic mechanism of whiplash there is a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms. Of all these consequences, alteration of cervical posture and range of motion (ROM) are two of the most common in consultations after whiplash. Cervical rectification produces forward head posture and, in addition, it can be one of the main causes of symptoms because of a lower cranio-vertebral angle, greater severity in neck pain and greater functional disability.",

      "title": "Sleep-Wake Cycles: Revealing the Hormonal Symphony of Melatonin and Circadian Rhythm Disorders - A Comprehensive Review",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm (biological rhythm) disorders alter the body's natural sleep-wake cycles and have been associated with mood fluctuations, cardiovascular problems and cognitive degeneration. Notable disorders that result from an imbalance between an individual's internal circadian rhythms and external factors, such as light exposure and social responsibilities, can lead to conditions like delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSPD), advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPD) and Shift work disorder (SWSD). The pineal gland secretes melatonin, a hormone that promotes sleep and indicates darkness to stabilize the circadian rhythms. This study explores the impact of melatonin on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's central clock, and its potential therapeutic applications for disorders that disrupt the circadian rhythm. Melatonin treatment lowers sleep onset latency (SOL), advances sleep-wake cycles in individuals with DSPD, and enhances morning alertness, according to clinical investigations. It improves the quality of sleep, which has some advantages for ASPD, especially in older persons. Melatonin lessens daytime drowsiness, eases insomnia, and helps sleep patterns adapt to work schedules for SWSD. In addition to discussing ideal dosage, possible adverse effects, and the necessity of customized care, this review highlights the significance of more research on the long-term safety of melatonin, medication interactions, and its application in combination therapy for disorders of the circadian rhythm.",

      "title": "Sleep and Quality of Life in Headache and Migraine",
      "abstract": "Headache and sleep disorders are prevalent, comorbid conditions that challenge physical as well as psychosocial well-being. Headache is the most common pain-related complaint and the seventh leading ailment seen in medical practice, accounting for 18 million physician visits annually in the USA alone (1). Though historically headache often has been trivialized (perhaps because pain is not easily quantified and headache does not generally compromise life expectancy), headache is in a major quality of life (QOL) concern. In fact, migraine headache is among the 20 leading causes of \"years lived with disability\" according the World Health Report (2). The burden of headache is increasingly appreciated in psychological, family and interpersonal, vocational, and economic realms. Headache, particularly in its more chronic and severe forms, has been linked to sleep disorders. Interestingly, the sleep disorders associated with headache are varied in nature, including obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder, circadian rhythm disorder, insomnia, and hypersomnia. General symptom patterns, particularly morning headache and chronic daily headache, are suggestive of and aid in recognition of a sleep disorder. Management of the sleep disorder may improve or resolve the headache; sleep-disordered breathing is the most empirically supported example of this relationship. Although pure sleep-related headaches, such as hypoxemia-related headache, are less prevalent and more easily recognized, primary headaches as well are often impacted to some degree by sleep. Irrespective of sleep disorders, variation in the sleep/wake schedule is one of the most common acute headache precipitants while sleeping is one of the most common palliative responses to headache. Insomnia is the sleep disorder most often cited by clinical headache populations. Despite an emerging literature supporting the interdependence of sleep and headache, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains speculative. Few well-controlled studies are available, and it is difficult to generalize results across sleep and headache literatures due to inconsistencies in diagnostic nosologies, lack of standardized outcome measures, and varied populations. Future research with improved methods is needed to identify mediating factors between sleep and headache. This chapter reviews the co-morbidity of headache and sleep disorders, prevalence, diagnostic considerations, societal and individual burden of headache, clinical implications, and considerations for future directions.",

Nearly all of the patients show breathing abnormalities during their lifespan, both in wake and sleep and respiratory illness represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality in RTT. Pathogenic mechanisms underlying breath-holding and other breathing abnormalities in RTT are mainly related to dysautonomia and an alteration in respiratory control at different levels, including several regions of the central and peripheral nervous system. Pathogenic variants in the MECP2 gene have been implicated in the dysfunction of respiratory pathways, affecting chemosensitivity and the response to neurotransmitters. In addition, frequent comorbidities such as scoliosis, dysphagia, sleep disorders, and epilepsy can further impair the respiratory function in these patients.",

      "title": "BEHAVIORAL STUDIES OF SLEEP PATTERNS IN ALCOHOLICS DURING INTOXICATION AND WITHDRAWAL",
      "abstract": "Twenty-four-hour sleep patterns of 50 male alcohol addicts were assessed behaviorally during a 5-day base-line period, a 7- to 62-day period of spontaneous drinking and a subsequent alcohol withdrawal phase. Alcohol ingestion produced an increase in total hours of sleep which was associated with two distinctive changes in sleep patterns:1) fragmentation , a tendency to sleep in several short episodes (3-4 hours) instead of a sustained night9s sleep; and 2) somnolence , the distribution of consecutive hours of sleep was shifted beyond the base-line mode and long sleep episodes were combined with occasional naps. Fragmentation of sleep patterns was the most reliable correlate of alcohol ingestion and a frequent accompaniment of alcohol withdrawal. However, there were no common sleep distribution patterns during alcohol withdrawal either as a function of symptom severity or type of medication used. Contrary to the prevailing clinical impression, abrupt cessation of drinking did not invariably produce an initial insomnia. Moreover, hallucinosis occurred as a concomitant of the alcohol abstinence syndrome and independent of an antecedent or concurrent state of insomnia. These data are discussed in the context of current models of physical dependence.",

Acute and chronic pain differ from each other clearly. Acute pain warns about danger that is threatening the human body. This starts us to evaluate the situation and to act upon the danger. Behind an acute pain is always some somatic disturbance or disease. Acute pain causes also many changes in the autonomic nervous system; blood pressure, muscle tension and heart rate raise when the body is in the alarm position. Chronic pain doesn't warn the body about threatening danger because clear pathology doesn't always exist. Chronic pain reduces human life. It causes zest for life, tiring and reluctance. The chronic pain brings also following symptoms: sleeping disturbances, depression, social isolation, unemployment and loss of control of life.",

The authors also review helpful points to consider when evaluating patients in order to avoid making common mistakes. A number of sleep disorders exist; the categories range from disorders of sleepiness, or hypersomnia, to disorders resulting in insomnia. Also included are circadian rhythm abnormalities and sleep-related breathing disorders. In obtaining the sleep history, one should start by determining the presenting symptom or primary reason the patient has come for evaluation. The majority of sleep complaints can be divided into excessive sleepiness, difficulties with falling asleep or staying asleep, and abnormal behaviors or sensations associated with sleep. Social factors such as work schedules, caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol use, and stressors have sleep-related implications. Sleep disorders often have a genetic or familial tendency.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the national health portal (Government of India) have now recognized sleep deprivation as a public health epidemic. The main effects of sleep deprivation include physical effects (sleepiness, fatigue, or hypertension), cognitive impairment (deterioration of performance, attention, concentration and intellectual capacity and increase of the likelihood of accidents) and mental health complications. Rotational night shift work is often accompanied by insufficient sleep and disruption of circadian phase, each related to repeated errors on task performance as a result of lapses in attention and increased reaction time. Maintaining good quality of sleep is vital for the establishment of positive health and physical/mental well-being; nonetheless, lifestyle and environmental factors are progressively causing hitches in sleeping. Individuals with shift work sleep disorders need a customized and comprehensive therapy that includes counselling, yoga/meditation and behavioural therapy along with requisite pharmacological management, as and when warranted.",

      "abstract": "Sleep consists of two complex states--NREM and REM sleep--and disturbances of the boundaries between the states of sleep and wakefulness may result in violence. We investigated our population for reports of violence associated with sleep. REM behavior disorder is rarely associated with injury to the sufferer or others. NREM sleep related nocturnal wandering associated with self-inflicted injuries has variable etiologies. In the elderly, it is associated with dementia. In young individuals, it may be associated with mesio-temporal or mesio-frontal foci and an indication of a complex partial seizure. It also may be related to abnormal alertness and is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, micro-sleeps, and hypnagogic hallucinations in sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or sleep disordered breathing.",

Увеличилось распространение опухолей, сердечно-сосудистых, нейро-дегенеративных болезней, стрессовых состояний и других нарушений регуляции. Совокупная неврологическая патология стала самой распространенной причиной инвалидности и одной из частых причин смерти. Эту неблагоприятную тенденцию удается в значительной степени преодолеть своеобразной гимнастикой для мозга, усложнением его работы, необходимостью одновременно выполнять две задачи. Обе задачи могут быть двигательные или когнитивные, или одна двигательная, другая - когнитивная. Синхронное выполнение двух задач совершенствует функцию мозга, улучшает состояние человека в старости и при многих болезнях. The increased life expectancy, the aging of the Earth’s population, and the reduced physical activity in work and everyday life have changed the nosological profile of mankind. The prevalence of tumors, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative diseases, stress conditions, and other dysregulations has increased. Cumulative neurological pathology has become the most common cause of disability and one of the most common causes of death. This unfavorable trend can be largely overcome by a kind of exercise for the brain that complicates its work by the requirement to perform two tasks simultaneously. Both tasks can be either motor or cognitive, or one task can be motor and the other cognitive. The synchronous performance of two tasks improves the brain function in old age and in many diseases.",

Neuronal migration begins in the second gestational month and is driven by a cascade of complex chemical signals. When these signaling pathways are deficient or interrupted (e.g., by a hypoxic-ischemic event), the neurons do not migrate to the proper areas of the brain. This failure of normal signaling results in structurally abnormal or completely absent brain regions, including in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, or hippocampus. NMDs involving the cerebral cortex are characterized by abnormal lamination and folding.",

Toutefois, Les mecanismes qui permettent d’expliquer le lien entre les troubles du rythme circadien et la depression ne sont pas encore connus a ce jour. Certains modeles proposent une explication chronobiologique a l’apparition des symptomes depressifs, c’est le cas de l’hypothese de la desynchronisation interne. Par ailleurs, de plus en plus d’auteurs suggerent l’existence d’un oscillateur externe, capable d’entrainer les rythmes biologiques et le rythme veille-sommeil. Parmi les anomalies rythmiques constatees chez le sujet depressif, les perturbations de l’axe corticotrope sont les plus frequentes. Or, le cortisol semble jouer un role primordial a la fois dans la regulation de l’humeur et dans le systeme circadien. Cette revue de la litterature a pour but de presenter les mecanismes neurophysiologiques et chronobiologiques qui soustendent ce role. Les preuves de l’implication de cette hormone dans la physiopathologie de la depression y sont egalement discutees, via l’etude de la Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) lors de l’episode depressif et au cours d’epreuves de desynchronisation interne. Enfin, cet article s’attardera sur l’effet de differentes strategies antidepressives, a la fois sur les rythmes circadiens et sur la regulation de l’axe corticotrope. Bien qu’il existe des liens evidents entre la regulation de l’axe corticotrope, le cycle veille-sommeil et l’humeur, la cascade d’evenement qui conduit a l’apparition des symptomes depressifs devra faire l’objet d’etudes ulterieures, afin de confirmer cette hypothese chronobiologique.",

This occurs despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep to occur and is associated with impairment of daytime function. Patients with insomnia may describe frequent extended periods of wakefulness during the sleep period or persistent morning awakenings that are earlier than desired (terminal insomnia). Insomnia can be divided on the basis of its duration into transient or short-term (lasting only a few days to three to four weeks) or chronic (persisting for more than one to three months). This chapter on pharmacologic therapy of sleep disturbance will be limited to the treatment of chronic insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Sleep inertia (SI) defines a period of transitory hypovigilance, confusion, disorientation of behavior and impaired cognitive and sensory-motor performance that immediately follows awakening. SI, the cognitive and behavioral correlate of the transition from sleep to wakefulness, has been incorporated in several models of sleep and vigilance regulation. Monitoring of several physiological parameters during the awakening period clearly indicate that this transition process is very slow. On the cognitive and behavioral side, SI has relevant operational implications. SI is one of the most serious contraindications to the use of napping during quasi-continuous operations if the individual may be required to perform complex tasks immediately after sudden awakening at unpredictable times. The studies on SI modulating factors showed that SI is strongly affected by slow wave sleep amount and sleep depth, while the outcomes concerning the modulation of SI by circadian factors are not consistent. Cognitive tasks involving high attentional load seem to be much more affected by SI than simple motor ones, performance accuracy being more impaired than speed. Finally, some possible countermeasures against the detrimental effects of SI to be applied in operational settings have been provided.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases affecting the respiratory system are usually present during the day and the night; however, sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome is a disease manifesting only during sleep. It is defined as a cessation (apnea) or a reduction of breathing (hypopnea) of 10 seconds or more during sleep. Each of these apneas or hypopneas is usually terminated when the person awakens for a few seconds. Typically, patients do not remember these transient awakenings. There are two general categories of apnea: central and obstructive. These categories are classified according to the presence or the absence of respiratory effort. Central sleep apnea is a result of the absence of nerve impulses from the brain to the respiratory muscles and therefore occurs in absence of respiratory effort. Obstructive sleep apnea is much more common. This condition is caused by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway (pharynx) during sleep. Therefore, respiratory efforts are still present during apnea and usually increase throughout the apnea. The individual makes larger and larger respiratory efforts until they arouse from sleep apnea and reopen their upper airway so breathing can resume. As will be discussed, some overlap exists between obstructive and central apnea in both disease presentation (so‐called mixed apnea) and in pathogenesis.",

Sleep disorders often result in impaired daytime functioning, affecting work performance and increasing the likelihood of motor vehicle accidents.

This chapter discusses the six major categories of sleep disorders: insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders. Infants require 16–18 hours of sleep per 24 hours, young children 11–13 hours, teens 9–10 hours, and adults 7–8 hours. Insufficient sleep now is present in growing numbers of preadolescents and adults and is the most common sleep problem today. Given the frequent overlap of sleep disturbance with many neurologic conditions, neurologists are well positioned to identify and provide treatment of sleep–wake disorders. A basic sleep history, including questions about snoring, sleep habits, sleep initiation and continuity, daytime fatigue/sleepiness, leg symptoms, and bed partner complaints, should become a part of neurologic evaluation.",

Impaired circadian rhythms have been reported in neurodegenerative conditions; however, there are no reports of any circadian rhythm sleep disorder among patients with Parkinsonian syndromes. We report two patients who presented with this circadian rhythm disorder, and were then diagnosed with a Parkinsonian syndrome. The cases. A 65-year-old retired man presented with history of abrupt change in sleep schedules, sleeping around 6.30-7 p.m. and waking up around 3-4 a.m. for the last 2 months. On detailed examination, the patient was observed to have symmetrical bradykinesia and cogwheel rigidity of limbs. A diagnosis of multiple system atrophy was made, supported by MRI findings and evidence of autonomic dysfunction. Symptoms of change in sleep-wake cycles resolved over the next 1 year, while the patient was treated with dopaminergic therapy. A 47-year-old man, who was being evaluated for presurgical investigation for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, presented with complaints suggestive of dysarthria, bradykinesia of limbs and frequent falls for 5 months. Simultaneously, he began to sleep around 7 p.m. and wake up at about 2-3 a.m. Examination revealed severe axial rigidity, restricted vertical gaze and bradykinesia of limbs. A diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was made.This is the first report of Parkinson's plus syndromes presenting with a circadian rhythm sleep disorder-advanced sleep-phase type.

      "title": "Comparison in Heart Rate Variability during Working and Non-working Nights",
      "abstract": "Measurements of changes in heart rate variability (HRV) are often used for evaluation of the effects of working stress on people, where its different parameters may indicate various aspects or varieties of working stress (physical, mental, emotional). The magnitude of mean R-R intervals, for example, is related to physical component of working stress, while their variability indices and power spectrum parameters may reflect mental and/or emotional aspects of working stress. Various studies have shown poorer performance, poorer safety, higher fatigue, greater stress etc, during night shifts in comparison with daily working. One of the reasons for pointing out night-shift work as an important stressor, per se, might be the rigidity of circadian changes in supremacy between sympathetic and parasympathetic parts of the vegetative system, where, normally, the former prevails during day and the later during night. Working in night shifts demands an extra effort, which requires a significant involvement of sympathetic control of bodily functions. One could argue, therefore, that if the work efficiency is to be maintained at the daily level, the level and the patterns of changes in cardiac activity during night-shift should be similar to those during daily work. If this is not the case, the changes in cardiac activity during night-shift working and during non-working nights, should be similar in the patterns, but not necessarily in the levels. The aim of this study was to compare levels and patterns of HRV changes of eight medical nurses during night-shift working and non-working nights. The study included continuous recordings of R-R intervals for 10 hours during night-shift working, as well as 10 hours recording during non-working nights. Analyses of R-R intervals showed, as expected, some differences in the levels, but not as much in the patterns of changes, between working and non-working nights. Non-working nights were characterised by somewhat longer R-R intervals, higher variability indices and, as shown by spectral analysis, a greater parasympathetic activity in cardiac modulation. On the other hand, the patterns of changes in R-R intervals and their spectral compositions during working and non-working nights were similar, showing thus the supremacy of the circadian pattern of changes, i.e. parasympathetic prevalence during night in both cases (correlations range from 0.44 – 0.58). Parasympathetic prevalence during night-shift working presents a kind of maladjustment, since normal working implies sympathetic activity. This is particularly true for the period between 03.00 and 06.00 hrs, when various parameters indicate almost the same level of arousal during night-shift and non-working night. Certainly, the lack of sympathetic activity and parasympathetic dominance represent a major source of stress in night-shift work.",

      "title": "SLEEP APNOEA: CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES AND TREATMENT",
      "abstract": "An awakening has taken place over the last 25 years to the science of sleep disorders. Foremost amongst these, both in the medical world and the public eye, has been Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (SAS). The prevalence is thought to be the order of 1-2%. Males are eight times more commonly affected than females, although after the menopause the gap narrows considerably. Sleep apnoea occurs in children, usually in relation to large tonsils and adenoids, but in adult life patients usually present between the age of 40 and 60 and the prevalence increases with age. Numerous apnoeas or hypopnoeas during the night's sleep result in disordered sleep architecture and unrefreshing sleep. This is usually accompanied by night-long snoring which may lead to marital discord and even complaints from neighbours. Symptoms on waking may be a headache and a feeling of not being refreshed by sleep. Sleepiness during the day can interfere with work and social activities and may produce risks to the patient and others if it occurs while operating dangerous machinery or driving. Over a longer time scale SAS results in intellectual and memory deterioration, a higher incidence of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, polycythemia and pulmonary hypertension. Right heart failure is particularly likely if there is chronic airflow obstruction contributing to a low arterial oxygen level. Asystolic periods and tachyarrhythmias may occur during apnoeic periods. The increased mortality of SAS relates to coronary and cerebrovascular disease and arrhythmias. Sudden death occurs with greater frequency in patients with SAS, mainly at night.",

      "abstract": "This is an investigation of the psychological characteristics of males who normally obtain over nine or under six hours of sleep per 24 hours, and who function well with these unusual amounts of sleep. The study includes results from detailed sleep histories, sleep logs, psychiatric interviews, and a number of psychological tests. Short sleepers were found generally to be smooth, efficient persons with a tendency towards handling stress by keeping busy and by denial. Long sleepers were \"worriers\" and were chronically somewhat depressed or anxious; they scored higher than the short sleepers on most tests of pathology. This group also included some creative persons. It is suggested that the differences in sleep need may be a<i>response</i>to the above differences in life-style and personality and that sleep, and especially D-sleep, may have a function in restoring the brain and psyche after stress or psychic pain.",

However, the subject is poorly covered in medical education. A major consequence is that the manifestations of the many sleep disorders now identified are likely to be misinterpreted as other clinical conditions of a physical or psychological nature, especially neurological or psychiatric disorders. To illustrate this problem, examples are provided of the various possible causes of sleep loss, poor quality sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of disturbed behaviour at night (parasomnias). All of these sleep disorders can adversely affect mental state and behaviour, daytime performance or physical health, the true cause of which needs to be recognised by clinicians to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. As conventional history taking in neurology and psychiatry pays little attention to sleep and its possible disorders, suggestions are made concerning the enquiries that could be included in history taking schedules to increase the likelihood that sleep disorders will be correctly identified.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia symptoms are the most common medical complaints, affecting up to a third of the general population. Insomnia symptoms include sleep problems (initiating or maintaining sleep) as well their repercussions on wake-time functioning. Insomnia Disorder can be diagnosed when insomnia symptoms are recurrent (>3 times a week), persistent (> 3 months), cannot be attributed to sleep-disrupting circumstances, and impair daytime functioning. Insomnia Disorder affects approximately 10% of the population and tends to persist over months or years. Insomnia Disorder severely reduces the quality of life and carries an increased risk of severe, long-lasting health problems, including cardiovascular and mood disorders. Given its high prevalence, persistence and impact on health, it is highly important to study the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder during wakefulness and sleep. Overall, the study of the endogenous EEG dynamics in Insomnia Disorder revealed that hyperarousal of the central nervous system occurs not only during sleep but also during wakefulness. During wakefulness, Insomnia Disorder is characterized by stronger cortical oscillations in a broad beta band and by increased cortical sensitivity to cardiac activity. Furthermore, people with more severe insomnia complaints show stronger Long-Range Temporal Correlations of the amplitude fluctuations of cortical oscillations; which is consistent with a weaker inhibitory bias in the cortical balance between excitation and inhibition. During sleep, the shallow and more fragmented sleep that characterizes Insomnia Disorder may particularly involve N2 instability. Resolving the causal relationship between sleep fragmentation and excitation/inhibition balance is the next key-step in the understanding of the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder.",

Such disturbances of sleep could be characterized by a dissociation of the daily sleep volume into some epoches which lasted not more than 5-6 hours each. The EEG, submental EMG and heart rate as well as respiration were recorded continuously during the sleep periods. Eye movements, however, as they are not detectable by electric recording, were observed visually. In our 4 cases of blind children eye movements disappeared during sleep and sleep stages characterized by desynchronized EEG were found to be reduced. This suggests that there might be an injury of nervous mechanisms responsible for the paradoxical sleep stage.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a complex chronic condition causing widespread pain and variety of other symptoms. It produces pain in the soft tissues located around joints throughout the body. FMS has unknown etiology and its pathophysiology is not fully understood. However, abnormality in circadian rhythm of hormonal profiles and cytokines has been observed in this disorder. Moreover, there are reports of deficiency of serotonin, melatonin, cortisol and cytokines in FMS patients, which are fully regulated by circadian rhythm. Melatonin, the primary hormone of the pineal gland regulates the body's circadian rhythm and normally its levels begin to rise in the mid-to-late evening, remain high for most of the night, and then decrease in the early morning. FMS patients have lower melatonin secretion during the hours of darkness than the healthy subjects. This may contribute to impaired sleep at night, fatigue during the day and changed pain perception. Studies have shown blunting of normal diurnal cortisol rhythm, with elevated evening serum cortisol level in patients with FMS. Thus, due to perturbed level of cortisol secretion several symptoms of FMS may occur. Moreover, disturbed cytokine levels have also been reported in FMS patients. Therefore, circadian rhythm can be an important factor in the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of FMS. This article explores the circadian pattern of abnormalities in FMS patients, as this may help in better understanding the role of variation in symptoms of FMS and its possible relationship with circadian variations of melatonin, cortisol, cytokines and serotonin levels.",

This is the part of the brain that integrates higher mental functions, general movement, and the functions of the internal organs in the abdominal cavity, perception, and behavioral reactions. The early warning system will be based on three factors: 1. Detection of abnormal electrical activity of brain. 2.

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medical disorders can give rise to disturbances of sleep and alter sleep architecture. Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

The present study of 57 patients shows that the negative assessment is partly due to the subjective views exhibited by the narcoleptic personality prone to underestimation, negative self-image and depressive disposition. The personality traits may be due to an adaptation reaction to the disease but also to the biological predisposition. Comparison with population data for our Republic brought no evidence of progress at education or family life being adversely affected by narcolepsy, however, decreased assertion in employment and limitation in self-realization in free time was an explicit consequence of the disease. All 57 patients reported excessive daytime sleepiness as the most discomforting symptom that in 40% of them was responsible for career curtailment in a productive age and for living on partial or full disability.",

      "title": "Targeting epigenetic mechanisms for chronic visceral pain: A valid approach for the development of novel therapeutics",
      "abstract": "Chronic visceral pain is persistent pain emanating from thoracic, pelvic, or abdominal origin that is poorly localized with regard to the specific organ affected. The prevalence can range up to 25% in the adult population as chronic visceral pain is a common feature of many visceral disorders, which may or may not be accompanied by distinct structural or histological abnormalities within the visceral organs. Mounting evidence suggests that changes in epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the top-down or bottom-up sensitization of pain pathways and the development of chronic pain. Epigenetic changes can lead to long-term alterations in gene expression profiles of neurons and consequently alter functionality of peripheral neurons, dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and brain neurons. However, epigenetic modifications are dynamic, and thus, detrimental changes may be reversible. Hence, external factors/therapeutic interventions may be capable of modulating the epigenome and restore normal gene expression for extended periods of time.",

Estudos concordam quanto à concentração de pacientes na quinta década de vida, associação com o sexo feminino e fatores socioeconômicos como baixos níveis educacionais, baixa renda e estar divorciado. As hipóteses de alterações anatomopatológicas para a fisiopatologia desta síndrome foram descartadas e os achados nesses sentido foram creditados ao sedentarismo. Os mecanismos mais aceitos para o entendimento fisiopatológico da fibromialgia no momento envolvem o desequilíbrio entre a percepção dolorosa e os mecanismos de modulação dessas vias aferentes. Níveis elevados de substância P em líquor e níveis reduzidos de serotonina e seus precursores em líquor, soro e plaquetas são sugestivos desses desequilíbrios, uma vez que a substância P é mediadora das vias aferentes enquanto a serotonina medeia a inibição da dor. Outra explicação para a alteração da atividade da serotonina seria o polimorfismo dos receptores de serotonina, o que pode explicar também o agrupamento familiar desses pacientes. Alterações cerebrais em porções rostrais ao tálamo poderiam ser responsáveis pela percepção elevada de estímulos ambientais, com a conseqüente perversão de informações proprioceptivas, térmicas e táteis ou pressórica em sensações dolorosas. Finalmente, os mecanismos reducionistas de explicação fisiopatológica da fibromialgia não têm encontrado respaldo na literatura e explicações multicausais são as mais aceitas, incluindo os mecanismos psicossociais, que não foram abordados neste artigo.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias comprise the behavioral, experiential, and autonomic nervous system disorders surrounding rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep and can cause injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Parasomnias often involve the abnormal release of instinctual drives, such as locomotion, aggression, feeding, and sex during sleep, and can manifest with dream-enacting behaviors. Parasomnias are relevant to psychiatrists in regards to their misdiagnosis as a psychiatric disorder; their nocturnal extension of a daytime psychiatric disorder; their stress-responsivity; their induction or aggravation by psychotropic drugs; their adverse psychologic con- sequences; their link to various neurologic and medical disorders; and their forensic implications. Parasomnias can be categorized as primary disorders of sleep, or as secondary organ system disorders emerging during the sleep period. The evaluation of parasomnias includes clinical interviews, review of medical records, screening psy- chologic tests, neurologic examination, and hospital-based polysomnographic moni- toring. This article discusses the six most prominent behavioral parasomnias: REM sleep behavior disorder, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals (including abnormal sleep related sexual behaviors and severe morning sleep inertia), sleep relat- ed eating disorder, and sleep related dissociative disorders. Parasomnias can appear at any time in the human life cycle, often demonstrate prominent gender discordances, and can usually be accurately diagnosed and effectively treated.",

Les parasomnies du sommeil lent profond (SLP) regroupent le somnambulisme, les terreurs nocturnes et les eveils confusionnels et surviennent au decours d’eveils brutaux en SLP. Elles s’associent souvent chez un meme individu et pourraient representer des variantes cliniques d’une meme pathologie.Longtemps considerees comme des troubles benins du sommeil, les donnees actuelles soulignent les consequences des parasomnies, avec des mises en danger et un retentissement fonctionnel diurne. Nos trois premiers travaux ont permis une meilleure caracterisation du phenotype et des consequences des parasomnies, en particulier sur le plan de la somnolence et des phenomenes douloureux chroniques. Pres de la moitie des adultes parasomniaques rapportaient une plainte de somnolence diurne excessive associee a une propension marquee au sommeil sur les premieres heures de la journee. Nous retrouvions une frequence elevee de douleurs chroniques, de cephalees et de migraine. Par ailleurs nous avons decrit un phenomene frequent d’hypo/analgesie au cours des acces parasomniaques.Le diagnostic des parasomnies du SLP repose uniquement sur des elements cliniques, sans criteres polysomnographiques objectifs. Si des travaux recents suggerent que les parasomnies sont associees a des alterations discretes de la microstructure du SLP, les performances diagnostiques de ces parametres n’ont pas fait l’objet d’etudes specifiques.

Un modele permet de conceptualiser les mecanismes de la maladie. Chez un patient predispose genetiquement, certaines conditions responsables d’une instabilite du SLP favorisent la survenue d’un eveil dissocie precipite par un stimulus eveillant.

      "abstract": "Although sleep is popularly conceptualized as a quiet state without movement, a variety of motor phenomena can occur during this time. With the aid of video-polysomnographic electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) monitoring, sleep-related movements can be directly observed. Movements can be described based on duration, amplitude, periodicity, and most importantly their predilection to disturb sleep or produce other undesirable consequences. Sleep-related movement disorders (SRMD) constitute a class of movements that are simple and usually stereotyped, and are associated with undesirable effects such as impaired sleep quantity or quality, and/or impairment in daytime functioning. Unlike parasomnias, they are not associated with sleep-related mentation and are not goaldirected. They may occur during the transition between sleep and waking, and vice versa, or during any sleep stages.",

The review also looks at the effect of melatonin and melatonin agonist on sleep and symptoms of depression, bipolar disorder and seasonal affective disorder. In Alzheimer's disease, the circadian rhythm alterations are associated with the change of melatonin levels and melatonin receptors. It has been reported that melatonin and melatonin synthetic enzyme levels decrease in autism spectrum disorder.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: The most important determinant of the circadian influences of sleep and wakefulness on BP is the nighttime parasympathetic prevalence and daytime sympathetic prevalence including many other physiologic mechanisms known either to induce sleep or determine arousal, may play an important role in the mediation of sleep influences on blood pressure (BP), and this disturbed sleep and high blood pressure is very common in Fibromyalgia Syndrome patients. Each stage of sleep exerts an effect on BP regulating and contributing to its circadian (24-h) rhythm. Alteration of one or more of such mechanisms may be reflected in altered circadian BP rhythms in Fibromyalgia Syndrome. Methods: Sleep and arousal-related mechanisms that is disturbed in FMS patients along with the parameters that effect circadian BP rhythms including neurohumoral sleep factors like melatonin and waking factor like Cortisol was done in 50 FMS patients and equal number of controls. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed in 50 FMS and compared to those of 50 control subjects matched for age, gender and daytime BP. Results: The non-dipping pattern (a less than 10% reduction in nocturnal BP) was more prevalent in FMS than in control subjects (89 versus 64%, P < 0.01). Nighttime BP was higher in FMS than in control subjects (P < 0.01 and < 0.001 for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively). Whereas, the night time levels of melatonin was found to be significantly lower, and that of Cortisol levels were found to be higher during night hours among FMS patients group. Conclusion: An abnormal circadian BP profile is highly prevalent among FMS patients. These changes in the circadian BP rhythm are known to be strongly related to one's risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and extreme severity of FMS symptom.",

To the clinical mind the term connotes a condition in which an alleged sleeplessness is the main or solitary symptom, in which there are few tangible physical causes and in which the pathologic basis, if any, is not readily detectable. A person who has genuine pain and whose physical derangements are such that sleep is obviously impossible is not ordinarily regarded as having insomnia. What constitutes true insomnia is largely a matter of capricious opinion on the part of both patient and physician. It would be of considerable advantage to determine whether there is a definite optimum of human sleep, that is, a basic requirement comparable to basal metabolism, from which deviations could be measured. Adult normal sleep defies standardization, for even the most regular of sleep rhythms must be regarded as a complex process which can be influenced by both physical and",

One notes a predilection for certain types of epilepsy to occur in sleep, such as benign focal epilepsy of childhood, or to occur shortly after awakening (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). Epilepsy may disrupt the sleep architecture with an increase in light sleep and a decrease in deep sleep, and an increase in awake time after sleep onset. Sleep is an important activator of IEA and is of value both in the routine EEG evaluation of epilepsy as well as in more prolonged studies used in epilepsy monitoring units.",

The phrase \"sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)\" indicates a wide array of conditions characterized by snoring and/or respiratory distress due to increased upper airway resistance and pharyngeal collapsibility; these range from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and occur in all age groups. In the general pediatric population, the prevalence of OSA varies between 2% and 5%, but in some particular clinical conditions, it can be much higher. While adenotonsillar hypertrophy (\"classic phenotype\") is the main cause of OSA in preschool age (3-5 years), obesity (\"adult phenotype\") is the most common cause in adolescence. There is also a \"congenital-structural\" phenotype that is characterized by a high prevalence of OSA, appearing from the earliest ages of life, supported by morpho-structural abnormalities or craniofacial changes and associated with genetic syndromes such as Pierre Robin syndrome, Prader-Willi, achondroplasia, and Down syndrome. Neuromuscular disorders and lysosomal storage disorders are also frequently accompanied by a high prevalence of OSA in all life ages. Early recognition and proper treatment are crucial to avoid major neuro-cognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic morbidities.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders and stroke are intricately linked through a complex, bidirectional relationship. Sleep disturbances such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, and restless legs syndrome (RLS) not only increase the risk of stroke but also frequently emerge as consequences of cerebrovascular events. OSA, in particular, is associated with a two- to three-fold increased risk of incident stroke, primarily through mechanisms involving intermittent hypoxia, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation. Conversely, stroke can disrupt sleep architecture and trigger or exacerbate sleep disorders, including insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm disturbances, and breathing-related sleep disorders. These post-stroke sleep disturbances are common and significantly impair rehabilitation, cognitive recovery, and quality of life, yet they remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. Early identification and management of sleep disorders in stroke patients are essential to optimize recovery and reduce the risk of recurrence. Therapeutic strategies include lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatments, medical devices such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and emerging alternatives for CPAP-intolerant individuals. Despite growing awareness, significant knowledge gaps persist, particularly regarding non-OSA sleep disorders and their impact on stroke outcomes. Improved diagnostic tools, broader screening protocols, and greater integration of sleep assessments into stroke care are urgently needed. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the interplay between sleep and stroke, emphasizing the importance of personalized, multidisciplinary approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Advancing research in this field holds promise for reducing the global burden of stroke and improving long-term outcomes through targeted sleep interventions.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a major complaint among cancer patients, yet it is unknown whether cancer-related fatigue experienced during the day relates to sleep/wake cycles or to the quality and quantity of sleep obtained at night. Although it is not well defined or well understood at present, cancer-related fatigue is generally regarded as a form of tiredness that does not improve following rest or sleep. Objectively recorded sleep and biological rhythms have not been well investigated in these patients, but it appears that most cancer patients may in fact not be getting a good night's sleep. Evidence is accumulating that sleep is often disturbed in cancer patients, probably owing to a variety of causes. We posit that some degree of cancer-related fatigue experienced during the day may relate to sleep/wake cycles or to the quality and quantity of sleep obtained at night. Different components or dimensions of fatigue (physical, attentional/cognitive, emotional/affective, etc.) are probably associated in some way with disrupted sleep and desynchronized sleep/wake rhythms. These associations may change in measurable ways prior to treatment, during treatment and after treatment completion. In cancer patients, as in other medically ill patients, sleep that is inadequate or unrefreshing may be important not only to the expression of fatigue, but to the patients' quality of life and their tolerance to treatment, and may influence the development of mood disorders and clinical depression. This review summarizes the state of the literature on fatigue, sleep and circadian rhythms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within rapid-eye-movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep, or during arousals from sleep. Parasomnias encompass abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Also, instinctual behaviors can be involuntarily and pathologically released with the parasomnias, including sexual behaviors (sexsomnia), aggression, locomotion, and eating. The clinical consequences of a parasomnia can affect the patient, the bed partner, and any nearby individual. Sexsomnia is classified as a variant of confusional arousals (and sleepwalking), an NREM parasomnia, with amnesia for the sexual behaviors virtually always reported. The cumulative world published literature on sexsomnia consists of 220 cases, 84% males and predominant age in the 30s and 40s. Most cases were identified as NREM parasomnias, although obstructive sleep apnea was the identified trigger in 10.4% of cases. Various other triggers were identified. Forensic consequences were reported in 15 of the reported clinical cases. Sleep medicine physicians can expect inquiries from attorneys to solicit their involvement in criminal trials as forensic implications of parasomnias become increasingly more apparent. As courts generally have an implicit bias that is not favorable to the “sleepwalking defense,” sleep medicine physicians who take on the mantle of an expert medical witness should define their role and understand that supporting justice in the courtroom can only be optimally done through a strong collaborative effort with the attorney throughout the legal process.",

Während die schlafbezogenen Bewegungsstörungen wie Restless Legs Syndrom und Bruxismus sehr häufig in der Bevölkerung auftreten, handelt es sich bei den Parasomnien um weniger häufig auftretende Erkrankungen, die zudem in ihrer medizinischen Bedeutung oft unterschätzt werden. Die Erforschung der REM Schlafverhaltensstörung, die zu mehr als 70% neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen jahrelang vorausgeht, hat dazu geführt, die Parasomnien in der Neurologie wieder stärker zu beachten.",

The brain of cetaceans can alternate sleep from cortical hemisphere to hemisphere. Usually the animal is either at rest on the bottom, or travels, commonly, in a clockwise direction during sleep phases. Sleep deprivation induces cellular and organismal stress because it exceeds the physiological and genetically determined time one can maintain wakefulness. There is tremendous variation in sleep requirements across species. The value of the physostigmine challenge test for narcolepsy, response of patients to imipramine, and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of hypocretin and its relevance are examples of information that require greater scrutiny and careful evaluation. Sleep generally cycles through stages. These stages are based on features recorded in the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG) and various respiratory parameters.",

      "title": "ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE INTEGRATED CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN",
      "abstract": "In the holistic approach in medicine а person is viewed through the bio-psycho-social model. Human health is a trinity of “soma” (body), “psyche” (soul) and social role (position) that are constantly interacting with each other and with the environment. Any action on one of the dimensions inevitably affects the others. Chronic non-communicable diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. They cause social, economic and psychological burden for individuals, their families and the whole society. Much of the socially significant diseases (especially cancer and degenerative diseases) are associated with chronic pain. Epidemiological data shows that between 10.1% and 55.2% of people in different countries suffer from chronic pain. Pain has been shown to affect all dimensions of health related to quality of life. Patients with chronic pain also suffer from depression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Limitation of physical activity leads to overweight and all additional health risks related to this condition. Depression, inability to work, impaired social contacts and suicidal thoughts make chronic pain a public health problem. Drug medication along with psychological support and social commitment are important elements of holistic integrated care for patients with chronic pain.The purpose of this article is to analyze the ethical considerations of integrative care for patients with chronic pain.In modern medical ethics autonomy is basic principle. In bioethics autonomy means “the capacity to make an informed, uncoerced decision for your health”. To participate in the decision-making process patients, need sufficient and comprehensive information. The right to information is a basic patient’s right and obligation of the physician. The partnership model is of great importance in the treatment of chronic diseases. The patient is engaged as part of the therapeutic team, actively participates in the healing process and implements self-management of the disease. Numerous studies have proven that patient involvement improves medical outcomes and cost-effectiveness in healthcare. The communication between the doctor and the patient is a cornerstone and a premise for quality medical care.In conclusion, in the age of high-tech medicine, the human factor and patient-centered care have remained intact. Good awareness of patients is of key importance for their participation in the treatment. Easily available, true and relevant information is a prerequisite for understanding the pain control options.",

      "abstract": "Background\r\nPer anni il sonno e stato ritenuto semplicemente una sospensione dell’attivita, uno stato passivo dell’inconscio e per anni ci siamo sbagliati. Il fallimento nella comprensione di questo fenomeno ha portato allo sviluppo della societa di oggi, societa che non si ferma mai per 24 ore al giorno e 7 giorni alla settimana. Poche persone tollerano il fatto che dormire sia una necessita e ancora meno persone credono che il sonno possa diventare patologico e necessitare di una cura. Questa attitudine e portata avanti dalla politica, dai manager delle industrie e anche da diversi professionisti della salute, non e solo una situazione insostenibile ma anche potenzialmente pericolosa. Una figura professionale particolarmente colpita e quella dell’infermiere, essa ha il compito di provvedere alle cure del paziente in qualsiasi ora del giorno e di conseguenza il lavorare a turni e inevitabile. L’alterazione dei ritmi circadiani causata dal lavorare a turni provoca l’insorgenza della sindrome del turnista, un disturbo sotto diagnosticato, le stime riferiscono che un lavoratore su cinque ne e colpito. La sindrome causa sonnolenza, stanchezza, ridotte capacita esecutive, aumento degli incidenti al lavoro, insonnia e anche problemi fisici come disturbi gastro intestinali, aumento della pressione sanguigna e patologie cardiache. Lo scopo di questo lavoro e di ricercare quali trattamenti che non includano farmaci sono disponibili per trattare la sindrome del turnista nell’infermiere.\r\n\r\nMetodologia\r\nLa metodologia intrapresa per trattare questa tematica e stata la redazione di una revisione narrativa della letteratura, le banche dati consultate sono le seguenti: “Chocrane Library”, “CINHAL (EBSCO)”, “PubMed” e “MEDLINE”. Gli articoli utili trovati sono stati 10. La ricerca e costituita dalle seguenti tappe metodologiche: formulazione domanda di ricerca, definizione criteri inclusione ed esclusione, ricerca e selezione degli articoli, valutazione della qualita degli studi, descrizione dei risultati e infine discussione di questi ultimi. \r\n\r\nRisultati \r\nDai dieci articoli selezionati, in otto di loro e emerso che i due trattamenti selezionati sono efficaci per trattare la sintomatologia della sindrome del turnista. I trattamenti che sono risultati efficaci sono dormire per un breve periodo durante il turno notturno e l’esposizione della luce intensa a inizio turno mattutino o durante la notte con lo scopo di anticipare o ritardare i ritmi circadiani. Entrambi i trattamenti in generale si sono dimostrati efficaci nel migliorare le prestazioni lavorative, ridurre il rischio di errori, facilitare l’adattamento dei ritmi circadiani e migliorare le percezioni soggettive inerenti alla stanchezza e sonnolenza dei partecipanti.\r\n\r\nConclusioni\r\nLe strutture lavorative infermieristiche alla luce dei risultati emersi dovrebbero mobilizzarsi e permettere all’infermiere di usufruire dei trattamenti sopra citati.

      "title": "What Are Nurses Doing to Help PMS Patients?",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a hot topic these days but the disorder remains an enigma. Many women suffer, to some degree, the cyclic signs of PMS-irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired concentration, breast swelling and tenderness, headache, binge eating and/or craving for sweet or salty foods. But why? Is the cause hormonal and/or biochemical imbalance, poor nutrition, underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other unknown factor(1-3)? syndrome is defined as a complex of symptoms-somatic, behavioral, and emotional-occurring in the luteal phase. This phase usually begins in midcycle with ovulation, when the follicle is changed into corpus luteum, and ends at (or shortly after) menstruation(l). In many ways, PMS mimics dysmenorrhea; the key differences are in the timing of symptoms and in pelvic cramping. Although headache, nausea, edema, and fatigue are common to both, pelvic cramping is specific to, and the principal sign of, dysmenorrhea, which generally begins a day or two before menses and peaks in severity on the first or second day of flow. PMS has a wider variety of symptoms (150 having been identified in the literature)(4). syndrome also begins earlier in the cycle than does dysmenorrhea, and PMS is abruptly relieved at menses. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of women of childbearing age suffer some premenstrual symptoms. However, it is also believed that only 5 to 15 percent have very severe symptoms(5). Many theories have been proposed on specific etiology. An estrogen/progesterone imbalance, excessive prostaglandins, abnormal magnesium metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, reactive hypoglycemia, and neuroendocrine changes in the hypothalmic-pituitary axis are among them, but no theory has been conclusively proved(1-8). Theories on effective treatment also abound. AJN asked nurses, physicians, and researchers involved in the treatment and study of PMS what methods they used, and to what effect. It became clear that nurses are playing the key role in the management of patients with PMS, and that they can back up their advice on methods with solid evidence. Michelle Harrison, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, author of Self-Help for Premenstrual Syndrome, advises physicians that nurses are ideally qualified to handle patients with PMS(9). Guy E. Abraham, a California PMS specialist known for significant research on nutritional and vitamin treatment for the disorder, agrees: The in PMS treatment is that the patient has most of her contact with a nurse. Total nurse management is not unusual, unless a medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible disease. predominant model might describe Mary Ann Wilson, RN, C, a nurse practitioner who has seen over 100 PMS patients in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in East Hartford, Connecticut. department is staffed by five nurse practitioners, four physicians, and two RNs who do phone follow-up. Wilson says PMS patients are referred to the nurse practitioners. We do all the screening and counseling, unless a medical problem is indicated, or the patient requests an MD, she reports. initial PMS consult is scheduled during the patient's asymptomatic follicular phase (which runs from menses to ovulation), Wilson explained, since a PMS patient is then under less stress and she'll have much more energy to do what you suggest. Some women, says Wilson, will first call during an emergency. We'll do a 'validating' visit; we will talk and calm them and advise a visit when they don't feel so bad. If the patient seems in crisis, particularly if she is suicidal, we will send her immediately to the mental health department for counseling. Most HMO patients have had a thorough physical within six to 12 months of seeking help for PMS. nurse reviews the patient's chart for health problems that could be contributing to, or confused with, PMS. A nutritional history is taken, with particular attention to excessive alcohol, salt, and caffeine intake.

The early research on stress clearly documented the importance of biological bases of the stress process. The research on stress has renewed the interest in the significant influence of psychological factors in health and illness. Chronic stressors can cause neural and endocrine change that alters the normal functioning of the organism. The physiological response to stress is also accompanied by behavioural responses. Stress has direct physiological effects on the body, and the cumulative wear and tear on the system caused by recurring stress can eventually cause damage to the system.",

OSAS is characterized by recurrent partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep, causing apnea and hypoventilation. More and more studies have shown that repeated hypoxia and reoxygenation cycles of OSAS may directly or indirectly increase risks of ischemic stroke and poor outcome by causing adverse consequences such as vascular dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and mental damage. In addition, the incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) after stroke has also increased significantly, both of which are causal.

Dyspnea on exertion (DOE) may occur normally, but is considered indicative of disease when it occurs at a level of activity that is usually well tolerated. Dyspnea should be differentiated from tachypnea, hyperventilation, and hyperpnea, which refer to respiratory variations regardless of the patients subjective sensations. Tachypnea is an increase in the respiratory rate above normal; hyperventilation is increased minute ventilation relative to metabolic need, and hyperpnea is a disproportionate rise in minute ventilation relative to an increase in metabolic level. These conditions may not always be associated with dyspnea.Orthopnea is the sensation of breathlessness in the recumbent position, relieved by sitting or standing. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) is a sensation of shortness of breath that awakens the patient, often after 1 or 2 hours of sleep, and is usually relieved in the upright position.Two uncommon types of breathlessness are trepopnea and platypnea. Trepopnea is dyspnea that occurs in one lateral decubitus position as opposed to the other. Platypnea refers to breathlessness that occurs in the upright position and is relieved with recumbency.",

In neurobiological terms, consciousness may be viewed as having an arousal dimension and an awareness dimension phenotypically expressed as the capacity to respond to self or environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness is associated with lesions that disrupt neuronal systems in the brainstem and diencephalon that mediate arousal or thalamocortical or corticocortical systems that mediate awareness. As there are many causes of unconsciousness, a timely and focused history and neurologic examination are critical to defining the differential diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

Medication side effects: Some medications can cause symptoms such as dizziness or unsteadiness as a side effect. Eye disorders: Visual disturbances, especially problems with coordination between the eyes or damage to the retina, can cause imbalances.

We report the first case of CWS, in whom neuropsychological functions, extension of the underlying lesion, and sleep architecture changes were assessed. A 73‐year‐old woman reported a total dream loss after acute, bilateral occipital artery infarction (including the right inferior lingual gyrus), which lasted for over 3 months. In the absence of sleep–wake complaints and (other) neuropsychological deficits, polysomnography demonstrated an essentially normal sleep architecture with preservation of REM sleep. Dreaming was denied also after repeated awakenings from REM sleep. This observation suggests that CWS (1) can represent a distinct and isolated neuropsychological manifestation of deep occipital lobe damage, and (2) may occur in the absence of detectable REM sleep abnormalities.

      "abstract": "The article gives an overview of the most frequent forms of vertigo, that are of peripheral-labyrinthine, central-vestibular, psychogenic, or physiologic origin. Dizziness or vertigo is a result of a mismatch between 3 sensory systems: the vestibular, the visual, and the somatosensory systems. These systems are mutually interactive and redundant in that orientation and balance are guided by simultaneous reafferent cues. The functional ranges of the systems overlap, thus permitting them to compensate in part for each other's deficiencies.Vertigo is not a well-defined disease entity, but rather a multisensory syndrome induced either by stimulation of the intact sensorimotor system by motion (eg, physiologic vertigo as in motion sickness or height vertigo), or by pathologic dysfunction of any of the stabilizing sensory systems (eg, peripheral vestibular as in vestibular neuritis, or central vestibular as in vertebro-basilar ischemia). The core region in vestibular vertigo syndromes is the vestibulo-ocular reflex, a 3-neuron arc that mediates the information of the semicircular canals and otoliths via the vestibular nerve and vestibular nucleus to the ocular motor nuclei (VI, IV, III) and the supranuclear integration centers in the ponto-mesencephalic brain stem.Clinical phenomena characteristic for physiological and pathologic vertigo syndromes include postural, perceptual, oculomotor, and vegetative syndromes, which manifest with ataxia, nystagmus, vertigo, and nausea. Thus, the clinical testing must include examinations of postural, perceptual, oculomotor, and vegetative dysfunctions.",

      "abstract": "Everyone can feel tired at times during the week, and the reasons for this are often quite obvious, including late nights, early starts, sleep disturbances or stress. But some students feel tired all the time, despite a good night's sleep. Constant tiredness and exhaustion are not normal and can be detrimental to mental and physical health. Lack of sleep due to stress is a serious problem among students. This condition has many negative consequences for health and academic performance. Consider the impact of stress on students' sleep and how it affects their lives. The impact of stress on students' sleep in its manifestation has the following effects: physiological effects of stress: increased cortisol levels, stress causes the release of cortisol, a stress hormone that makes it difficult to relax and fall asleep. The sympathetic nervous system also reacts, its activation due to stress leads to increased heart rate and increased readiness of the body for action, which prevents falling asleep. The psychological effects of stress are manifested by a state of worry and anxiety, stress is often accompanied by thoughts about problems and future tasks that prevent relaxation. Long-term stress can lead to depressive states, which negatively affect the quality of sleep. Social and behavioral factors are revealed through the academic load, high demands of learning, preparing for exams and performing tasks that increase the level of stress. Often, due to studies and social life, students neglect a regular sleep schedule, which worsens its quality and disrupts the daytime routine itself. There are major consequences of lack of sleep, which are manifested due to a decrease in immunity, chronic lack of sleep reduces the body's resistance to infections. There is a great risk of diseases. Lack of sleep is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. Cognitive disorders are reflected in mental health. Lack of sleep impairs memory, concentration and learning ability. Emotional instability leads to lack of sleep, increases feelings of anxiety, depression and irritability. Academic success is also not on the sidelines: the effectiveness of learning is significantly reduced. Lack of sleep affects the ability to absorb new information and reduces productivity. Poor performance appears: Students who suffer from sleep deprivation often perform the worst in exams and in studies in general.",

Syncope deserves diagnostic analysis because, while unexplained syncope is associated with a slight increased mortality rate within 1 year, when syncope can be linked to a cardiovascular cause, the 1-year mortality rate is 20% to 30% [1]. Syncope is defined as the transient loss of consciousness with a lack of responsiveness and postural tone, followed by spontaneous recovery. Consciousness is lost when the function of both cerebral hemispheres or of the brain stem reticular activating system is compromised. Interruption of cerebral blood flow and/or the occurrence of severe hypoxemia (arterial oxygen pressure Pa02 > 15 mmHg) to the cerebral hemispheres or brain stem results in loss of consciousness within 10 s [2]. A fall in systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg or a mean blood pressure of 30 to 40 mmHg results in syncope.

      "title": "Sleep in Patients with ESRD Undergoing Hemodialysis",
      "abstract": "Sleep has been identified as an essential human need; this is partly because of the metabolic activities that occur while the individual is sleeping. Normal sleep is divided into non–rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM sleep comprises 75% to 80% of total sleep time (TST), and is characterized by relatively quiescent brain activity and decreased metabolic rate (Carskadon & Dement, 2000). NREM sleep consists of four stages (S1-S4), with each stage leading to a progressively deeper sleep. REM sleep follows slow wave sleep (SWS), or deep sleep, and increases over the night, comprising 20% to 25% of TST. REM sleep is characterized by an activated EEG pattern, muscle atonia, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movements. Normal sleep provides a period of physiologic and mental rest. During sleep, sympathetic tone decreases and parasympathetic tone increases, leading to a reduction in heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and cardiac output (Rosenthal, 1998). Deep sleep is theorized to be necessary for physiologic restoration. REM sleep is associated with dreaming, and is essential for maintaining emotional and cognitive well-being (Redline et al., 2004). Waking and consciousness depend on the activity, of neurons in the ascending reticular activating system of the brainstem. These neurons project into the thalamus, hypothalamus and basal forebrain and eventually send projections to the cortex. There are particular neurotransmitters, such as the catecholamines, acetylcholine, histamine, glutamate and aspartate, that are localized within the reticular formation and have important roles in cortical activation and arousal (Jones, 1989). Sleep-promoting neurotransmitters include gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine, and melatonin. Specific stages of sleep are regulated by the turning “on” and “off” of various neurons. REM “on” use GABA, acetylcholine, and glutamine, whereas REM “off” use norepinephrine and serotonin. REM On cells are cholinergic in the lateral pontine and medial medullary reticular areas that innervate the thalamus, hippocampus and hypothalamus. These discharge at high rates during REM and show little or no activity during NREM.REM Off cells are noradrenergic and serotonergic found in the locus coeruleus and raphe. These are which are slow or silent during REM sleep. Affecting levels of norepinephirne or serotonin can have an effect on REM sleep (Hoyt, 2005). Sleep regulation is a balance between a homeostatic sleep need and an intrinsic body clock, or circadian pacemaker. Located in the suprachiasmic nucleus, the circadian pacemaker determines the onset and termination of sleep, and is partially regulated by environmental",

More fat was found in apneic person at the base of the tongue, where the tongue's extrinsic muscles attach to the bone.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting in cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. Although it is largely unclear whether dysfunctions in sleep and circadian rhythms contribute to the etiology of AD or are a consequence of the disease, there is evidence that these conditions are involved in a complex self‐reinforcing bidirectional relationship. According to the recent studies, dysregulation of the circadian clock already occurs during the asymptomatic stage of the disease and could promote neurodegeneration. Thus, restoration of sleep and circadian rhythms in preclinical AD may represent an opportunity for early intervention to slow the disease course.",

      "abstract": "It has long been known that short-term (days) insufficient sleep causes decrements in mental effectiveness that put individuals at increased risk of committing errors and causing accidents. More recently, it has been discovered that chronic poor sleep (over years) is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes (metabolic syndrome, obesity, degraded behavioral health). Implementing an effective sleep health program is, therefore, in the best interests of active duty personnel and their families both in the short- and long-term. Like managing physical activity or nutrition, effectively managing sleep health comes with its unique set of challenges arising from the fact that individuals who routinely do not obtain sufficient sleep are generally desensitized to feeling sleepy and are poor at judging their own performance capabilities--and individuals cannot be compelled to sleep. For these reasons, an optimally effective sleep health program requires 3 components: (1) a rigorous, evidence-based sleep education component to impart actionable knowledge about optimal sleep amounts, healthy sleep behaviors, the known benefits of sleep, the short- and long-term consequences of insufficient sleep, and to dispel myths about sleep; (2) a nonintrusive device that objectively and accurately measures sleep to empower the individual to track his/her own sleep/wake habits; and (3) a meaningful, actionable metric reflecting sleep/wake impact on daily effectiveness so that the individual sees the consequences of his/her sleep behavior and, therefore, can make informed sleep health choices.",

      "title": "Waking up to the importance of sleeping well for cardiovascular health",
      "abstract": "The potentially adverse impact of poor sleep quality, insomnia, and other sleep disorders on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been the subject of increasing exploration over the past decade. Obstructive sleep apnea has been the most extensively studied sleep disorder in relation to hypertension, and is thought to be causally related through mechanisms including heightened sympathetic nervous system activity and vascular endothelial dysfunction that are triggered by sleep-disordered breathing.1 A growing body of research evidence has also revealed relationships between insomnia and CVD. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder and is defined by subjective reports of difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking too early.2 With insomnia, both sleep quality and duration are often impaired. Although a diagnosis of insomnia disorder may be based on self-report alone, objectively assessed insomnia features using polysomnography reveals longer sleep onset latency, more frequent nocturnal awakenings, and prolonged periods of wakefulness during the sleep period relative to normal sleepers.3 Observational studies employing objective sleep measures show that individuals with insomnia are more likely to have CVD, even after controlling for comorbid sleep disorders, and other potentially confounding comorbidities.4 Short sleep duration has also been associated with an increased risk of heart disease, higher blood pressure (BP), metabolic syndrome, greater coronary calcification, and higher levels of stress hormones.5 An important pathway through which sleep may affect CVD risk is through its relationship with BP, with substantial support for an association between insomnia and incident hypertension.6, 7 For example, in a prospective study of 786 men and women from the Penn State Cohort, those with chronic insomnia, determined by polysomnographic study and subjective reports of sleep problems persisting for over a year, were at over twice the risk of developing hypertension over a 7.5-year follow-up period. Furthermore, chronic insomnia coupled with short sleep duration (<6 hours) was associated with a fourfold increased risk of developing hypertension.8 Other studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, have reported similar observations, reinforcing the perspective that insomnia, when coupled with short sleep duration, may be especially hazardous in terms of its association with hypertension and CVD.9-11 Poor sleep quality is a widespread problem, commonly reported by patients with a variety of medical and mental health conditions,12, 13 as well as among those with diagnosed sleep disorders. However, the potentially broad impact of poor self-reported sleep quality on CVD risk has received relatively little attention. In the current issue of the Journal of Clinical Hypertension, Lo and colleagues report14 an informative meta-analysis examining the association between subjective sleep quality and BP. The authors include data from studies based on over 45 000 participants spanning five continents and provide formal analyses of studies that assessed subjective sleep quality using the well-established and validated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.15, 16 Their analyses showed that poor subjective sleep quality was associated with higher BP and an increased likelihood of hypertension. The impact of poor sleep quality is perhaps likely to be most conspicuously reflected in BP during the nighttime sleep period. Ambulatory BP monitoring studies have established that BP typically exhibits a circadian rhythm characterized by a fall in pressure during the nighttime sleep period. Relative to daytime pressure, a nighttime dip in BP of ≥10% is considered normal and individuals with this level of BP dipping are referred to as BP dippers, whereas a nighttime BP dip of <10% describes nondippers.17 Lo and colleagues found that in the subset of studies in their meta-analysis, which used both the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and ambulatory BP monitoring, BP dippers were characterized by better sleep quality than nondippers. Other studies, using subjective as well as objective measures of sleep quality derived from polysomnography and actigraphy, also have shown poor sleep quality to be associated with a blunting of the normal nighttime dip in BP.18-22 The nondipping circadian BP profile is associated with target organ damage, including cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy and chronic kidney disease23, 24 and is a strong prognostic indicator of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for both patients with and those without hypertension.23, 25-28 This evidence underscores the importance of BP measured during the nighttime sleep period, reflecting its greater prognostic significance than clinic BP, or ambulatory BP assessed during the daytime.29 Nonetheless, the physiological mechanisms accounting for blunted nighttime BP dipping and elevated nighttime BP are not well understood.30 Sympathetic nervous system activity normally shows a substantial decline from daytime waking activities to nighttime sleep, but the magnitude of this decline is attenuated in the context of a nondipping nighttime BP profile.21, 31, 32 Heightened nighttime sympathetic nervous system activity would favor peripheral vascular constriction, resulting in abnormally elevated systemic vascular resistance during the sleep period.33 The contribution of vascular disease to a blunted nighttime BP dip is supported by observations that a nondipping circadian BP profile is approximately twice as common in patients with coronary heart disease compared with age-matched healthy controls.34, 35 Blunted BP dipping has also been associated with impaired vascular endothelial function in women with untreated hypertension.35 As might be anticipated, in a study of men and women with hypertension, the hemodynamic mechanism related to a nondipping BP profile was a failure for systemic vascular resistance to show a normal decline during the nighttime sleep period.37 In view of the well-established pathophysiologic significance of elevated systemic vascular resistance in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension,38 coupled with the prognostic significance of elevated nighttime BP, it is not difficult to appreciate the potential importance that sleep quality may have in the pathogenesis of hypertensive heart disease. The available evidence therefore clearly implicates poor sleep quality and insomnia as risk factors in the cause of hypertension. It also suggests that in the context of high BP and hypertension, poor sleep quality may exacerbate hypertension by promoting target organ damage and increasing the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. However, the critical question of whether poor sleep quality is a modifiable risk factor for hypertension and CVD remains unanswered. In 2016, the American Heart Association published a scientific statement calling for research aimed at better understanding the association between sleep duration, sleep quality, and insomnia with CVD.39 Despite the wealth of available evidence, it is almost all observational, and the existence of a causal relationship between insomnia and CVD remains conjecture rather than inference. However, there is some preliminary evidence suggesting that sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for hypertension. In a pilot study of 22 adults with high BP, who slept <7 h/d, 13 were randomized to a 6-week intervention designed to extend the sleep period and 9 to a control condition.40 Those in the sleep-extension group showed a postintervention increase in sleep duration of 35 minutes following the intervention, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in 24-hour BP, whereas no significant changes occurred in the control group. We now need more well-designed randomized controlled trials to test the broad hypothesis that improving sleep quality in individuals with insomnia or subjectively reported sleep problems will reduce the risk of developing hypertension, as well as help control BP in those with hypertension, ultimately reducing the risk of adverse clinical events. Examining the effects of pharmacological treatments to improve sleep would be of interest, but interventions using cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia may be especially informative. Cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia is safe and effective and is the current gold standard for insomnia treatment.41 Therefore, it is ideally suited for intervention trials in healthy individuals and in patients with hypertension and/or other medical and psychiatric comorbidities. The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.",

Partial seizures are broadly classified as simple or complex and are characterized by asymmetrical clinical signs.

      "title": "33 Melatonin and Sleep Disturbances in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are much more prevalent in the dialysis population than in the general population [1]. Several studies on the impact and importance of sleep problems on quality of life in patients on dialysis revealed that sleep disturbances have a major effect on the vitality and general health of these patients [2]. Sleep disturbances in patients on dialysis might be caused by both the pathology of the renal disease and the dialysis treatment itself [3]. Although sleep disorders found in this population can be complex—for example, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and periodic limb movement disorder can cause sleep problems for patients—this chapter will focus on disturbances in the circadian sleep–wake rhythm. Focusing on these disturbances is a novel field of interest in this patient population, but such disturbances can have a prominent role in the development of sleep disorders, and therefore in impairment of quality of life, in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). An overview of circadian sleep–wake rhythm, the scope of the problem regarding sleep disturbances in this population, the role of melatonin, possible external and internal influences on sleep–wake rhythmicity in patients with ESRD, and possible approaches for strengthening the synchronization of the circadian sleep–wake rhythm will be explored in the following sections.",

      "abstract": "Sleep, Depression and Insomniac Complaints It has been known for long that depressive disorders are almost always accompanied by disturbances of sleep. Neurobiologically oriented sleep research was able to demonstrate that besides unspecific changes of sleep continuity (prolonged sleep onset latency, increased number of waking periods and early morning awakening) there are also specific changes of sleep, like a reduction of slow-wave sleep and a disinhibition of REM sleep in depression. Disinhibition of REM sleep includes phenomena like a shortening of REM latency (i.e. the time between sleep onset and the occurrence of the first REM period) and intensified REM sleep especially at the beginning of the night with an increased REM density (increased frequency of eye movements during REM sleep). These changes have been interpreted within the framework of an animal model of NREM and REM sleep called the reciprocal interaction model. This model postulates that the early occurrence of REM sleep in depression is based on a central nervous imbalance between cholinergic and aminergic neurotransmission. Besides baseline findings of sleep in depression there are other data suggesting a prominent role of sleep and REM sleep regulation for depression. Almost all antidepressants suppress REM sleep, there is a specific therapeutic effect of sleep deprivation in depression and a close link between the occurrence of insomniac symptoms and depression. In this context, it is also worthwhile mentioning that specific cognitive behavioral interventions for insomniac symptoms, such as sleep hygiene, sleep-wake rhythm structuring and cognitive techniques to reduce nocturnal rumination are very effective in the treatment of insomnia. It is also hypothesized that these techniques may serve as a preventive strategy for ensuing depressive disorders.",

The causes of sleep disturbances are multifactorial and include nocturnal motor disturbances, nocturia, depressive symptoms, and medication use. Comorbidity of PD with sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, or circadian cycle disruption also results in impaired sleep. In addition, the involvement of serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic neurons in the brainstem as a disease-related change contributes to impaired sleep structures. Excessive daytime sleepiness is not only secondary to nocturnal disturbances or dopaminergic medication but may also be due to independent mechanisms related to impairments in ascending arousal system and the orexin system. Notably, several recent lines of evidence suggest a strong link between rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. In the present paper, we review the current literature concerning sleep disorders in PD.",

The cyclic organization of sleep was quite well preserved in all cases and all the sleep stages were represented with percentages within normal ranges. Sleep pattern. In the majority of the cases the identification of the different sleep stages was particularly difficult, often because of the rarity of the spindles, K-complexes and vertex sharp waves. Modifications of the epileptic discharges during sleep. During wakefulness the abnormalities were characterized by brief (0.5–2 sec) bursts of generalized spike and wave discharges at 4–5 cps, usually of low voltage. During sleep two types of epileptic discharges were observed: the first consisted of generalized bursts of spike and wave discharges similar to those observed during wakefulness; these discharges were always present during slow sleep but less frequent than during wakefulness; in three cases they persisted during REM sleep. The second type of abnormality consisted of spikes or multiple spikes, isolated or in long-lasting discharges up to 20 sec of duration, focalized or maximal over the vertex and central regions. These spikes observed in 7 patients, occurred in all stages of sleep and were particularly evident during REM sleep. Ictal electroclinical seizures of a clonic type, sometimes of long duration (up to 20 min) occurred during slow sleep awakening the subjects. In the LA syndrome the most important finding was the apparition during sleep, and particularly during REM sleep, of focal spikes over the central and midline regions, similar to those observed in RH syndrome.",

Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts.

Mental morbidity is least accounted form of all population health studies and with the threatening rates of mental ill-health and rising rates of deaths due to the lack of early recognition of these morbidities, with not many Indian studies to document this burden. Therefore, the presence of depression, anxiety and stress among medical undergraduate students was assessed using a previously validated and standardized instrument, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 42) and the associations with their socio-demographic characteristics were identified. The objectives of the study were to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among medical undergraduate students and to study the association of stress, anxiety and depression with the socio-demographic characteristics of medical under- graduate students.",

Although some events are uncommon, 3% of adults and 20% of children may have recurring nocturnal behaviors. Many of these events are passed off as little more than frivolous episodes. Yet, nocturnal events may provide important clues to sleep and neurological function. The diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal events can be difficult because of the frequent overlap of clinical descriptions and lack of diurnal findings. Patients may not follow the ''classical'' patterns of parasomnia or epilepsy, and some patients may have parasomnias provoked by other sleep disturbances or seizures. Thus, the diagnosis of these patients often requires intensive investigation and extensive neurophysiological monitoring.",

What is it about a trauma that influences health? Several candidates immediately come to mind. Psychologically, personal upheavals provoke intense and long-lasting emotional changes. The unexpected events are generally associated with cognitive disruption, including rumination and attempts to understand what happened and why. Socially, traumas are known to cause wholesale disruptions in people’s social networks. Behaviorally, and perhaps because of the social and psychological changes, traumas are often associated with lifestyle changes such as unhealthy smoking, drinking, exercise, sleeping, and eating patterns. Each of these psychological, social, and behavioral effects is associated with a host of biological changes, including elevations in cortisol, immune disruption, cardiovascular changes, and a cascade of neurotransmitter changes.",

It typically emerges in teenage years and persists into adulthood. In essence, people with the disorder have an abnormally delayed major sleep episode relative to the dark phase of the solar cycle, and hence great difficulty initiating sleep at an appropriately early time, and, as a knock-on effect, waking at a desirable time in the morning, leading to chronic, and often quite severe sleep restriction trying to conform to a 9 to 5 schedule. As a result, sleep on free days is often extended in compensation. When released from such schedule constraints, sleep duration and quality is normal; it is just delayed. This review highlights elements of our current understanding of the epidemiology, associations and pathophysiology of the disorder, before discussing how some of our knowledge of sleep and circadian physiology can be applied to guide treatment of it.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Evidence suggests that sleep is a vital component of physical and health well-being. However, while sleep problems are present in individuals with mental health problems such as depression, it has not been clear whether these conditions are independent or whether they might be causally related. Indeed, if sleep or sleep disorders predispose or modify onset and outcomes of mental health issues, treatment of these factors could be explored as new mental health prevention or treatment options. The aim of this review was to examine in detail the bidirectional relationship between sleep, sleep disorders, and mental and physical health and well-being. It has considered the evidence that sleep architecture disruption, occurring through both quantity, quality, and timing of sleep as well as through the presence of sleep disorders may both influence mental health and well-being as well as be disrupted by both physical and mental health conditions. Also, the review has explored the effects of sleep disruption on mental health and performance through fatigue, mood, and vigilance. The review has considered the bidirectionality between sleep, sleep disorders, and mental health to examine how these may lead to or exacerbate mental health disorders such as affective, anxiety, autism, depressive and schizophrenia disorders but also considers how these conditions can affect sleep. The review highlights that poor sleep or the presence of a sleep disorder can increase the risks from mental health conditions such as suicidality. Furthermore, mental health conditions such as anxiety and worry can cause racing or repetitive thoughts that can keep an individual awake, leading to shortened sleep. It is important that sleep and sleep disorders are considered potential modifiable factors that could improve mental health outcomes. The important interconnect between both physical and mental health and sleep, in patient evaluations, also needs to be considered as these may affect treatment pathways and patient outcomes. Further, more robust and perspective research is required to establish the triad relationship of physical, mental health, and sleep.",

      "title": "Optimizing Chronotherapy in Psychiatric Care: The Impact of Circadian Rhythms on Medication Timing and Efficacy",
      "abstract": "In many medical settings, medications are typically administered in the morning or evening, aligning with patients' daily routines. This practice does not stem from chronotherapy, which involves scheduling drug administration to enhance its effectiveness, but rather from the way clinical operations are structured. The timing of drug administration can significantly affect a medication's effectiveness and side effects, with the impact varying by up to ten times based on circadian rhythms. Disorders such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are linked to disruptions in these rhythms. Recent studies have found that circadian dysfunctions, including genetic and neurohumoral changes, underlie many psychiatric conditions. Issues such as an altered glucocorticoid rhythm due to impaired HPA axis function, disturbed melatonin balance, and sleep disturbances have been noted in psychotic disorders. Furthermore, mood disorders have been associated with changes in the expression of circadian rhythm genes such as",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Die REM-Schlafverhaltensstörung (RBD) ist häufig das erste für den Betroffenen lebensbeeinträchtigende Symptom einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass 81%–90% der Patienten mit einer RBD innerhalb von zehn Jahren eine Alpha-Synukleopathie (Morbus Parkinson, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz, Multisystematrophie) entwickeln. Durch das Fehlen der normalerweise auftretenden Suppression der motorischen Aktivität während des REM-Schlafes, kommt es zum Ausagieren von Träumen. Die Diagnosesicherung erfolgt mittels Polysomnografie. Meist tritt die RBD zwischen dem 50. und 60. Lebensjahr erstmals auf. Männer sind wahrscheinlich häufiger betroffen als Frauen. Bei Patienten mit RBD fallen oft schon früh subtile Veränderungen wie Hyposmie, Obstipation oder Veränderungen der Motorik oder Kognition auf, die weitere Zeichen einer beginnenden neurodegenerativen Erkrankung sein können. Das gleichzeitige Auftreten der RBD bei bekannter, neurodegenerativer Erkrankung, ist häufig mit einem schwereren Verlauf verbunden. Neben Bettsicherungsmaßnahmen kommen zur medikamentösen Behandlung am häufigsten Clonazepam oder hochdosiertes Melatonin zum Einsatz. Die RBD stellt als Prodomalstadium einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung einen zentralen Ansatzpunkt für die Entwicklung und Untersuchung einer neuroprotektiven, krankheitsmodulierenden Therapie dar.",

      "title": "Correlation of Stigma with Self-compassion in Patients with Bipolar Disorder",
      "abstract": "Background & Aims: The bipolar disorder is important mental disorder, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression.This chronic and complex disease affects the mood of the patient, causing continuous and abnormal mood changes from extremely good to extremely poor and depressed.These fluctuations often last for weeks or months.Frequent episodes of depression and mania affect the functioning of the individual in personal, professional, family, social, and cultural domains.Patients with the bipolar disorder experience a phenomenon known as stigma.Stigma is defined as a set of cognitions and behaviors that are activated by labeling, leading to social exclusion and isolation.The stigma of mental illness distinguishes the patients from other populations.The stigma of mental illness renders the patients incapacitated and socially isolated.In addition, the experience of stigma decreases the quality of life and health-seeking behaviors of the patients, threatening their socio-economic health.Subsequently, the social participation of patients with mental illness is disrupted, and they refrain from seeking social assistance.In fact, stigma leads to the rejection of patients with mental illness by the society, disrupting their emotional regulation and making them unable to have proper emotional regulation strategies.Furthermore, the stigma of mental illness causes the patients not to have appropriate coping strategies for the disease, hide their medical history from the medical staff, and avoid communicating with their friends after discharge from the hospital.Given the importance of the concept of stigma, identifying the positively correlated behaviors seems essential.Self-compassion is a positive behavior that may be associated with stigma.Individuals with high self-compassion are more likely to accept negative life events and have more accurate self-assessments and better mental health.Self-compassion is an important factor in the adaptive responses to the mood problems in patients with a history of recurrent depression.High self-compassion reduces the mental vulnerability of patients with mental illness to problems, their depression and social anxiety, shame caused by the illness, and selfcriticism.In contrast, the lack of self-compassion leads to self-judgment, a sense of further isolation, and a rush of negative emotions about oneself, which ultimately lead to the loss of intimacy in the relationships with others.Low self-compassion is present in a wide range of individuals with mental disorders and causes emotional distress, so that individuals with mental illness and low self-compassion are more likely to have suicidal thoughts.The present study aimed to assess the correlation between stigma and self-compassion in patients with the bipolar disorder.Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 200 patients with the bipolar disorder admitted to Iran Psychiatric Center in Tehran, Iran, who were selected via continuous sampling.Data were collected using a demographic data form and stigma and self-compassion tools.The demographic data form included data on age, gender, marital status, number of children, education level, occupation status, family history of mental disorders, number of family members, and number of admissions.The researcher evaluated the validity and reliability of the instruments.To determine validity, the instruments were provided to seven professors of the department of psychiatric nursing at Iran and",

So deep and so strongly held are these fantasies that their threatened loss frequently precipitates acting out and regressive behavior. Often one or both of the parents may appear to be almost psychotic, when previously they were functioning quite well. Children are drawn into this maelstrom, often siding with one or the other parent in a very pathological fashion. Examples of regressive behavior as well as case examples are given.",

Circadian rhythm hypotheses (summarized in) have stimulated research into the pathophysiology of SAD, postulating that: 1.The illness is a consequence of delayed phase position, 2.It is correlated with diminished circadian amplitude, or 3.It results from changes in the nocturnal duration between dusk and dawn e.g. of low core body temperature or melatonin secretion. Light is considered to act directly on the circadian pacemaker ('Process C') and not on sleep dependent processes ('Process S'). Thus successful treatment of SAD must act via mechanisms within known retinohypothalamic pathways.

Pojem nespecnosti je subjektiven, saj izraža clovekov obcutek kakovosti spanja. Fiziologijo spanja urejata dva mehanizma, cirkadiani ritem in homeostaza. Spanje sestavlja pet faz v obliki enega cikla, ki se preko noci tri do petkrat ponovi.\nV diplomskem delu smo obravnavali aktivno spanje pri starostnikih med 65. in 80. letom. Z anketo smo ugotavljali tipicne probleme in vzroke sprememb pri spanju ter možne vzroke motenj spanja in potrebne ukrepe za njegovo izboljsanje, kar skupaj imenujemo higiena spanja.\nRezultati raziskave so potrdili, da imajo starejsi ljudje pogostejse težave s spanjem. Kot glavni razlog motenega spanca je bil prisoten fizicni dejavnik. Pri tem so izpostavili dva dejavnika, težave pri uriniranju in bolecina, kot najpogostejsi motnji. Psihicni dejavnik je bil manj pomemben, medtem ko dejavniki okolja niso imeli bistvenega vpliva na motnje spanja. Starostniki so v vecini primerov izboljsevali svoje spanje z jemanjem tablet. V manjsi meri so jim v pomoc nemedikamentozni ukrepi.\nOpredeljeno je tudi zdravstveno vzgojno delovanje medicinske sestre, ki ima pomembno vlogo pri edukaciji starostnikov in svojcev za doseganje dobrega spanca. Dobro spanje zagotavlja pomemben doprinos h kakovosti življenja.",

      "title": "Panic disorder: from respiration to the homeostatic brain",
      "abstract": "There is some experimental evidence to support the existence of a connection between panic and respiration. However, only recent studies investigating the complexity of respiratory physiology have revealed consistent irregularities in respiratory pattern, suggesting that these abnormalities might be a vulnerability factor to panic attacks. The source of the high irregularity observed, together with unpleasant respiratory sensations in patients with panic disorder (PD), is still unclear and different underlying mechanisms might be hypothesized. It could be the result of compensatory responses to abnormal respiratory inputs or an intrinsic deranged activity in the brainstem network shaping the respiratory rhythm. Moreover, since basic physiological functions in the organism are strictly interrelated, with reciprocal modulations and abnormalities in cardiac and balance system function having been described in PD, the respiratory findings might arise from perturbations of these other basic systems or a more general dysfunction of the homeostatic brain. Phylogenetically ancient brain circuits process physiological perceptions/sensations linked to homeostatic functions, such as respiration, and the parabrachial nucleus might filter and integrate interoceptive information from the basic homeostatic functions. These physiological processes take place continuously and subconsciously and only occasionally do they pervade the conscious awareness as 'primal emotions'. Panic attacks could be the expression of primal emotion arising from an abnormal modulation of the respiratory/homeostatic functions.",

The data, past illnesses, prodromal symptoms, and psychosocial information were obtained from the plant medical records, the private physicians, and mainly from direct interviews with the surviving next-of-kin, usually the wife. The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death.",

      "abstract": "The circadian rhythm disorder often known as shift work sleep disorder (SWSD) is characterized by the presence of insomnia symptoms and/or sleepiness occurring in relation to a work schedule. According to epidemiological studies, 14%–32% of night workers and 8%–26% of rotated night workers suffer from SWSD. This sleep disorder is explained by the fact that shift workers are sleeping during the day when their biological clock is normally facilitating wakefulness. Therefore, there is a circadian misalignment between wake and sleep periods. In addition to this biological explanation, several psychosocial factors have been linked to SWSD and hypothesized as having an influence on the adaptation capacities to shift work. Psychological factors such as depression or sociological factors such as marital satisfaction are presented in an integrative model to give a broader view of the course of SWSD. Actual recommended assessment and treatment options followed by behavioral treatment suggestions are presented thereafter. The authors hope that the innovative conceptualization of SWSD presented within this chapter will bring attention to different relevant topics for future research in order to improve the clinical management of SWSD in the long term.",

      "abstract": "Sleep and awakening disorders are almost obligate manifestations of Parkinson’s disease. Primary sleep and awakening disorders in Par-kinson’s disease are associated with the degeneration of serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus and cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus. Impaired awakening maintenance with the development of hypersomnia may result from neuron degeneration in the locus coeruleus or pedunculopontine nucleus. A certain role may be played by the pathological basal ganglionic pulsation caused by striatal dopamine deficiency, which goes to both the thalamic reticular nucleus and pedunculopontine nucleus, as well as by dysfunction of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathways involved in sleep-wake cycle regulation. Synthetic melatonin (Melaxen) is one of the effective medications for the treatment of sleep disorders in Parkinson’s disease. The drug normalizes circadian rhythms and has a hypnotic effect although it is in the usual sense not a soporific agent. Melaxen has a minimum of side effects and is well tolerated by patients from different age groups.",

      "abstract": "Perceived sleep need can vary among individuals. Even if it shows the same short sleeping duration, it may be caused by different reasons including insomnia symptom, a person who sleep less (short sleeper), or sleep deprivation. To answer this question, we need a fundamental approach to classify Chronic Insomnia Disorder (CID) from various sleep types and to examine neural mechanisms underlying their differences. The present study aim to explore whether brain response to sleep-related picture differs in CID and several sleep types. 55 participants were divided into four groups: 25 Chronic Insomnia Disorder according to International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3 (ICSD-3) criteria (CID; 21 female, age=46.9±12.8), 15 Good Sleepers (GS; 10 female, age=38.4±13.7), 9 Short Sleepers (SS; sleep duration less than 6 hours per day but not have insomnia symptoms; 4 female, age=40.4±12) and 6 Insufficient Sleepers (IS; sleep duration less than 6 hours per weekday and weekend over sleep more than 2 hours; 3 female, age=32.1±16.1). During fMRI, participants completed a sleep-related picture task. To examine group differences in brain response to sleep-related pictures vs. control pictures, one-way ANOVA was conducted. Furthermore, correlation analyses were performed to test associations between neural response and clinical features including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS). CID showed significantly greater PSQI, ISI and DBAS scores than three other groups (p<0.05). Compared with the other groups, CID group showed increased neural response to sleep-related pictures in bilateral insula, right anterior cingulate cortex, left postcentral gyrus, left posterior insula (p<0.001, cluster size=50). Brain response in these regions was positively correlated with PSQI and ISI scores (p<0.05). CID showed increased responses to sleep-related pictures in brain regions have been implicated in attention and emotional regulation. These results suggest that there may be attentional bias or emotional response to sleep-related pictures in CID patients.

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are complex behaviors occurring out of or during sleep. Parasomnias are increasingly presented as proof of an automatism in criminal cases involving violence. The sleep forensics expert must have an up-to-date understanding of current sleep science and research, diagnostic and clinical techniques, and the legal requirements of expert testimony and scientific evidence. Sleepwalking and related disorders typically follow sudden, partial awakenings from deep sleep. Higher-level cognition is severely limited or absent, and complex behaviors often consist of “automatic” behaviors not initiated or guided by memory or planning. Sleepwalking and related disorders are noted to occur during deep sleep and often require a genetic predisposition or priming factors. Prior cases of sleepwalking violence find that the victim of sleepwalking violence—most often a family member—seeks out the sleepwalker. The history of sleepwalking includes reports of episodes and sometimes criminal court cases of murder, assault, and rape.",

      "abstract": "Various research studies show that the amalgam of disordered sleep physiology, chronic fatigue, diffuse myalgia, and cognitive and behavioural symptoms constitutes a non-restorative sleep syndrome that may follow a febrile illness, as in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Where rheumatic complaints are prominent such a constellation of disturbed sleep physiology and symptoms also characterizes the fibromyalgia disorder. In contrast to the chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia is associated with a variety of initiating or perpetuating factors such as psychologically distressing events, primary sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder) and inflammatory rheumatic disease, as well as an acute febrile illness. The chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia have similar disordered sleep physiology, namely an alpha rhythm disturbance (7.5–11 Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep that accompanies increased nocturnal vigilance and light, unrefreshing sleep. Aspects of cytokine and cellular immune functions are shown to be related to the sleep-wake system. The evidence suggests a reciprocal relationship of the immune and sleep-wake systems. Interference either with the immune system (e.g. by a viral agent or by cytokines such as α-interferon or interleukin 2) or with the sleeping-waking brain system (e.g. by sleep deprivation) has effects on the other system and will be accompanied by the symptoms of the chronic fatigue syndrome.",

Environmental factors, such as light exposure, noise from diverse sources, and sleep interruptions related to patient care, have all received considerable investigational attention. Critical illness can affect elements involved in sleep initiation and maintenance. The various modes of mechanical ventilation may have different effects on sleep fragmentation and on the propensity to cause central apnoeas, thereby potentially prolonging the time on the ventilator. Pharmacologic agents, especially sedatives, can directly affect sleep architecture and may contribute to the incidence of intensive care unit delirium. Additional research is needed on the biological effects of critical illness on sleep, how sleep disruption affects systemic physiology and outcomes, and how these interactions can be modulated for therapeutic purposes.",

      "abstract": "Le sommeil est un état physiologique et comportemental caractérisé par une isolation partielle de l'environnement. Lors du sommeil, un événement perturbateur comme la douleur peut provoquer une réaction de microéveil brève et inconsciente vers un réveil comportemental caractérisé par une réactivation thalamocorticale complète et un niveau plus élevé de conscience. Le sommeil devient alors fragmenté et les plaintes de douleur se trouvent souvent exacerbées. La continuité oscillatoire de 90–110 minutes, rythme ultradien du sommeil léger et profond (non-REM: rapid eye movement) vers le sommeil paradoxal (REM), est alors rompue. Chez un patient souffrant de céphalée, on observe trois périodes durant lesquelles surviennent les crises en relation avec le sommeil: 1) dans les heures avant l'initiation du sommeil, 2) durant et, 3) après le sommeil. La céphalée de tension et la migraine, la céphalée de type hypnique, l'algie vasculaire de la face (cluster headache) et l'hémicrânie paroxystique chronique peuvent survenir en relation avec le sommeil. Soulignons que la céphalée du réveil est parfois associée à du bruxisme (serrement et grincement des dents), à un abus de médications antalgiques, à de l'hypertension, à un trouble de l'humeur ou à des réductions du flux respiratoire lors du sommeil. Les céphalées suite à un traumatisme crânien sont fréquentes et causent de l'insomnie, des réveils subits et prématurés et surtout des matins pénibles avec délai de phase circadienne. Dans le contexte d'une céphalée survenant en relation avec l'insomnie ou la somnolence diurne, la recherche de troubles respiratoires du sommeil, d'intrusions sous forme de mouvements périodiques des membres ou de bruxisme est indiquée. La polygraphie peut être effectuée en laboratoire ou en ambulatoire. La gestion de ces céphalées suit les grands principes de la médecine contemporaine tout en visant une hygiène du sommeil maximale par thérapie cognitive et comportementale, le maintien d'un rythme circadien idéal, la prise de mélatonine, la correction du phénomène respiratoire. La prise d'hypnotique ne semble pas un traitement de choix à long terme.",

The reasons for this relationship are not completely understood but may involve endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we hypothesized that insomnia symptoms would be associated with reduced endothelial function. Methods: Working adults (n = 496, 67.5% female, 78.6% white, mean age 48.7 [SD, 10.8] years, body mass index 28.2 [SD, 6.7] kg/m 2 , diabetes 5.8%, hypertension 20.0%, hyperlipidemia 17.9%, heart disease 2.6%) enrolled in the Emory-Georgia Tech Predictive Health Institute study completed baseline demographic, clinical, depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7), sleep (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), and noninvasive endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) measures. Insomnia symptoms were defined as subjective sleep latency of 30 minutes or longer, nighttime or early morning awakenings, and/or sleep medication use occurring 3 times or more per week in the past month. Results: Insomnia symptoms were reported by 39.5% of participants. Multivariable regression models showed that insomnia symptoms, age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia were inversely related to FMD. After adjusting for age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia, participants reporting insomnia symptoms had lower FMD than did participants reporting better sleep (adjusted FMD mean, 6.13% [SD, 0.28%] vs 6.83% [SD, 0.26%], P = .035). Conclusion: In this study, insomnia symptoms were associated with reduced FMD. Research examining the therapeutic benefits of treating insomnia on endothelial function and future cardiovascular risk is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Control of respiration is quite complex, requiring inputs from a variety of sources working in concert to provide the neuromuscular interface necessary to maintain respiratory drive. In obstructive sleep apnea, the upper airway becomes blocked and marked effort on the part of the individual is required until the obstruction is broken, allowing respiration to occur again. If the apnea is sustained and frequent, one may see end organ damage. Muscle tone and neural output is changed during sleep. In obstructive sleep apnea, the majority of people have no difficulty breathing during the day, however during their normal sleeping time, these neuromuscular inputs are altered in such a fashion that the obstruction occurs. It is not uncommon for a Mueller type maneuver to occur, which increases vagus tone leading to bradycardia, sinus arrest and even asystole. Hypoxemia leads to increased sympathetic discharge which in turn can lead to systemic hypertension.",

Nighttime sleep disturbances, daytime hypersomnia, and disrupted circadian rhythms occur in the majority of people with psychiatric or neurological disorders. Evidence supporting that sleep and brain disorders have a bidirectional relationship, such as sleep disturbances increasing the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders and neuropsychiatric disorders disrupting sleep, is reviewed. This chapter also discusses how sleep and circadian rhythms play a key role in cognitive and emotional processes tightly linked to neurological and psychiatric disorders, and that not all forms of sleep and circadian rhythms disruption are equally associated with the different types of psychiatric or neurological disorders. This chapter also reviews how medications used to improve sleep are used to treat psychiatric or neurological disorders, and how therapies used to treat psychiatric or neurological disorders can differentially improve or disrupt sleep.",

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are an important aspect of geriatric psychiatry. In the United States, more than half of noninstitutionalized individuals age 65 years and older report chronic sleep difficulties (Foley et al. 1995; \"National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement\" 1991; Prinz et al. 1990). These problems affect quality of life, increase the risk of accidents and falls, and may lead to long-term-care placement (Pollak and Perlick 1991; Pollak et al. 1990; Sanford 1975). Working effectively with elderly individuals requires expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) includes eight general sleep disorders categories: insomnia disorder, hypersomolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, restless legs syndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Patients with these conditions generally complain about some aspect of their sleep and/or waking function. For some patients, the sleep-focused concerns pertain to the quality, timing, amounts, or discontinuity in their sleep. For other patients, primary complaints may focus more on daytime sleepiness or impairment. For a subset of patients, complaints may focus on unusual behaviors occurring in sleep. In this chapter we consider those sleep-wake disorders most commonly encountered in geriatric psychiatry. Among these are those insomnia disorders involving a difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime impairment or distress, as well as those that present as disorders of excessive daytime somnolence characterized by persistent daytime sleepiness that causes significant distress or impairment in function (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The most important disorders of excessive sleepiness are sleep ap-nea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and narcolepsy. Circadian rhythm disorders manifest as a misalignment between an indi-vidual's sleep-wake cycle and the pattern that is desired or required (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The circadian rhythm is important for function because it is a cycle not only of sleep and wakefulness but also of many physiological processes and phe-nomena, including body temperature, alertness, cognitive performance, and hormone release (Czeisler et al. 1990; Folkard and Totterdell 1994; Minors et al. 1994).",

De las manifestaciones resultantes las más típicas son: la taquicardia, el temblor, la retracción del elevador del párpado, el adelgazamiento, la inquietud psíquica y motora. El hipertiroidismo aparece unas veces sin causa conocida, pero en la mayoría de los casos obedece a uno de estos tres motivos: emociones, infecciones y accidentes de la vida sexual.",

The duration of each episode of any one sleep stage or any episode of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness was determined. After caffeine there was an increase in longer episodes of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but no significant change in the episode duration of any of the sleep stages. In the case of drug withdrawal there was no change in the episode duration of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but there was a significant shortening of episode duration in sleep stages 2 and 3+4, with a similar trend for REM sleep episodes. Caffeine 'insomnia' thus seems characterized by increased stability of wakefulness, and hypnotic withdrawal 'insomnia' by decreased stability fo sleep.

Any sudden change in living conditions (family environment, regime) can lead to stuttering. Stuttering is common in children with early speech development, as their parents read them extra poems, stories and constantly ask them: “Speak”, “repeat”, and children are forced to say that too much causes stuttering.

      "abstract": "Objectives: Insomnia and Stress impacts both neural development of central nervous structures, and they are involved in many clinical outcomes like sleep disorders, depression, cognitive impairment and other sleep disorders. Few authors investigated accurately relationship between implications of these two troubles above, and occurrence or complications of sleep quality. It has been showed that, the quality and the duration of sleep depended strongly on the lifestyle and the personal environment. Knowing that, insomnia and stress are a permanent part of our daily life, a complete exploration of their combined effects on our sleep quality and sleep duration may move forward the general approach of therapist about sleep impairment. Indeed, a complete evaluation should be made continuously on a brain to record all the waves fluctuations related to sleep, but an early detection of factors influencing these changes in cerebral wave may be equally interesting. To our knowledge, none made a clear statement on the combined effects of insomnia and stress on the Sleep Impairment events. The aim of this study is to explore how insomnia and stress together affects sleep quality and sleep duration (SD), in the general population is associated in simultaneous with sleep components, psychological stress, depression, anxiety, well-being, addiction and global health of participants; and if it is also influenced by the sociodemographic profile of each subject. Methods: The present study was led by the questionnaire Mental Health Profile of Etindele (MHPE) incorporating McNair test, and incorporated sub-score for sleep components, psychological stress, depression, anxiety, well-being, addiction, family history of the participant and his family. All this clinical and environmental measure were associated with sociodemographic profile of each participant, to address our question Our results showed that the stress level and sleep duration are comparable per gender and family history. Results: Sleep quality was correlated strongly with decrease of clinical parameters, and the level of stress. the results showed that lack of sleep combined with a low global score to MHPE are strongly correlated with sleep impairment, while score of memory and attention decreased with insomnia. Insomnia is strongly correlated with physical activity. Conclusion: Insomnia and stress together speed up decline of memory and sleep impairments.",

Natural aging can cause the input to the brain from the cochlea to be progressively compromised in most individuals, but in many cases the cochlea has relatively normal sensitivity and yet people have an increasingly difficult time processing complex auditory stimuli. The two main deficits are in sound localization and temporal processing, which lead to poor speech perception. Animal models have shown that there are multiple changes in the brainstem, midbrain, and thalamic auditory areas as a function of age, giving rise to an alteration in the excitatory/inhibitory balance of these neurons. This alteration is manifest in the cerebral cortex as higher spontaneous and driven firing rates, as well as broader spatial and temporal tuning. These alterations in cortical responses could underlie the hearing and speech processing deficits that are common in the aged population.",

Sleep is crucial to healthy children’s normal physical and psychological development and has an important value in chronic respiratory diseases. Impaired sleep quality, such as sleep deprivation or insufficient sleep during the night, and sleep respiratory disorders (SRDs) are common in 5% to 30% of the general population. Sleep disruption leads to attention deficits, daytime sleepiness, fatigue and mood disorders and correlates to a worsened quality of life. Furthermore, sleep respiratory disorders (SRSs) are under-recognized comorbidities in CF and PCD patients. SRSs include a spectrum of symptoms ranging from primary snoring through upper airway resistance to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), nocturnal hypoventilation and hypoxemia occurring in people with moderate to severe lung disease and damaging the disease-related outcomes and quality of life. Effective screening during sleep with polysomnography is very important for the timely initiation of efficacious treatments and to prevent worsened respiratory, metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes. However, the impact of SRDs on health and quality of life is still underinvestigated.",

Clinically, the distinguishing feature of sleep, in contrast to coma, is the ease with which the sleeping subject can be roused to awareness of the external world. Between alertness and coma are a variety of altered states of consciousness. Palliative sedation refers to the intentional clinical practice of suppressing consciousness to control refractory symptoms during the last days or hours of life, in a manner that is ethically acceptable to the patient, family and healthcare providers. The intractable symptoms, which have proven non-responsive to all other interventions, are contained by the induction and the continuance of deep sedation. Deep sedation may need to be maintained until death; the duration is usually in the range of 1–6 days. Trial releases of deep sedation can be orchestrated, if required, by withholding the dose or administering flumazenil. The dosage necessary to induce deep sedation is variable.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances and platelet serotonin in alcoholism",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Chronic alcoholism is frequently associated with sleep disorders, disrupted sleep, insomnia, mood instability and craving. Namely, alcohol affects sleep latency, disrupts the sleep periods during night, affects rapid eye movement sleep and elicits frequent episodes of wakefulness, and frequent shifts between sleep stages. Alcoholics often experience insomnia, especially during the withdrawal syndrome. In addition, insomnia is a risk factor for relapse into addiction of alcohol. Although the consumption of alcohol may improve sleep latency at the beginning of alcohol abuse, at later stages chronic alcoholism is associated with poor sleep quality, early wakening, and insomnia. Numerous neurotransmitters have been implicated in regulation of normal and irregular sleep behavior, and in the etiology of alcoholism. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has a major role in the control of many physiological and pathological functions and behaviors, including sleep, wakefulness, arousal states, vigilance behaviors, synchronization of the biological clock and circadian rhythmicity. Serotonergic neurotransmission from the dorsal raphe is associated with arousal and is turned off during sleep. Serotonin has a role in etiology of alcoholism. Central 5-HT synaptosomes and platelets similarly store, release and metabolize 5-HT, and therefore blood platelets might be used as a limited peripheral model for the central 5-HT synaptosomes. Platelet 5-HT concentration has been proposed to represent a biomarker for particular symptoms in psychiatric disorders, to be reduced in chronic alcoholics, and in subjects with disturbed sleep. Materials and Methods: Platelet 5-HT concentration was determined in male and female patients with chronic alcoholism, subdivided into patients with or without insomnia with a spectrofluorimetric method. Clinical diagnosis of alcohol dependence made according to the DSM-IV criteria, using Structured Clinical Interview. Insomnia was evaluated using the items 4, 5 and 6 from the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and alcoholics were subdivided into those with early, middle and late insomnia. Results: Male alcoholic patients with middle insomnia had significantly lower platelet 5-HT concentration compared to male alcoholics without middle insomnia. Platelet 5-HT concentration did not differ significantly among male alcoholic patients with or without early or late insomnia, or between female alcoholic patients with or without early, middle and late insomnia. Conclusions: Since ethanol improves the onset of sleep, while at the same time the duration of sleep is disturbed, lower platelet 5-HT concentration in middle insomnia suggest that this peripheral marker is altered in alcoholics with middle insomnia.",

Delirium is caused by a combination of risk factors that are both predisposing and precipitating. Advanced age, frailty, medication exposure or withdrawal, sedation depth, and sepsis are all known risks. Stressors most likely have coordinated rather than independent effects, and the systems they affect are linked rather than separate. Changes in the blood-brain barrier and the central nervous system's de novo synthesis or elaboration of inflammatory mediators account for the pathophysiology of delirium. It also seems that neuro-inflammatory activity contributes to the dysregulation of neurotransmitters.",

However, there are some disorders which are only found in infancy, as in the four conditions which we review below. In spite of great variation between individuals, the general way in which the wakefulness-sleep states mature during the first months of life is well known. In general the physiological patterns of REM and NREM are in general the same in children as in adults. However, the pathological patterns are similar, but there are major differences between them. These differences are mainly physiological, behavioural, parent-child relationship and specific disorders. We shall see that the central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome of infants is not the same as that of adults. The sleep apnea syndrome of the newborn is different to the apneas seen in older children. Benign neonatal myoclonia of sleep are not present in adults, and finally the sudden death of an infant is not like the unexplained nocturnal sudden death or sinus arrest linked to paradoxical sleep in adults.",

The physiology and pathology associated with sleep are important as potential causes of poor performance. The physiology includes the basics of sleep and sleep hygiene. The pathology is what may be present to a minimal or mild degree but will impact on sleep hygiene and performance the following day. The interaction between sleep and athletic performance is evident by published papers but the question is raised as how to apply this information in the athletic setting. An evidence based approach is difficult to be established due to the complex physiology of sleep and the intervariability among athletes. Sleep should be incorporated in the training programme based on the individualised needs of athletes whereas all athletes should be investigated for potent sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION\nLa Esclerosis Multiple (EM) es una enfermedad de naturaleza desmielinizante y curso cronico, cuya base anatomopatologica se caracteriza por un proceso de destruccion de las vainas de mielina que recubren los axones neuronales (manifestandose en forma de lesiones distribuidas extensamente en el parenquima cerebral y la medula espinal), lo que propiciaria una alteracion en los mecanismos sinapticos y la emergencia de los sintomas caracteristicos de la misma. Se trata de una neuropatologia que se diagnostica habitualmente al final de la segunda decada de la vida o inicio de la tercera, con una prevalencia superior entre las mujeres (2:1). Supone, ademas, una de las principales causas de discapacidad en este periodo etario. \nA nivel sintomatologico se aprecia una clinica diversa en la que predomina el compromiso sensomotriz, acompanado con cierta frecuencia de perdidas en otras areas de relevancia clinica y humana (vision, funcion vesical/intestinal, estabilidad postural, fatiga o dolor; entre otros). La evolucion es generalmente en forma de brotes periodicos (85%), seguidos de un periodo de remision/estabilidad tras el cual pueden prevalecer sintomas residuales (cuyo efecto acumulativo genera discapacidad con el devenir del tiempo). Ocasionalmente este proceso se presenta de modo continuo, tanto desde el inicio de la enfermedad (EM primaria progresiva) como tras algunos anos de convivencia con el subtipo bifasico (EM secundaria progresiva), momento en el que la EM constituye un reto terapeutico todavia mayor. \nLa literatura sobre esta patologia evidencia la presencia de resonancias en el area de la salud mental de estos pacientes (presencia de sintomas depresivos, deterioro de la calidad de vida, compromiso de la funcion cognitiva, etc.), que requieren la puesta en marcha de recursos diagnosticos y terapeuticos especificos dirigidos a su deteccion y abordaje clinico.\n OBJETIVO\nLa presente tesis doctoral tiene como proposito principal evaluar a un grupo de pacientes con diagnostico de EM en una serie de variables sociodemograficas, clinicas, psicologicas y neuropsicologicas; con el fin de explorar las relaciones que se establecen entre todas ellas y detectar las necesidades asistenciales de este colectivo en el ambito de la salud mental.\n METODO\nSe opto por un diseno descriptivo y transversal, de corte correlacional. Se incluyo un grupo control (personas sin evidencia de la enfermedad), de tamano equivalente al clinico (n=55 en ambos casos). Tras una profunda revision de la literatura, se procedio a la construccion de una bateria de evaluacion dirigida a la exploracion de las siguientes variables: estres (Escala de Sucesos Vitales Estresantes -SVEAD), afrontamiento (Cuestionario de Estilos de Afrontamiento -COPE), apoyo social (Cuestionario Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey -MOS-SSS), personalidad (Cuestionario de Personalidad de Eysenck Revisado -EPQ-R), sintomas psicologicos (Cuestionario Revisado de Sintomas Psicologicos -SCL-90-R), calidad de vida (Cuestionario Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 -MSQOL-54), dolor (West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory -WHYMPI) y funcion cognitiva (Bateria Neuropsicologica Breve -BNB y Trail Making Test -TMT). Para la evaluacion de las variables sociodemograficas se diseno una entrevista ad hoc.\nEl analisis de los datos contemplo estrategias de comparacion de medias, analisis multivariados (discriminante), analisis correlacionales y analisis de mediacion; ademas del calculo de los correspondientes tamanos del efecto. Adicionalmente, se exploro la consistencia interna de todos los factores sometidos a estudio.\n RESULTADOS\nDe las diferencias obtenidas entre los pacientes y la poblacion general (de las que se infieren las necesidades asistenciales) se concluye: un malestar emocional mas intenso, una erosion pronunciada de la calidad de vida, un apoyo social deficitario, un perfil de personalidad que implica vulnerabilidad para la psicopatologia, un estres acentuado y un uso mas frecuente del afrontamiento emocional. Paralelamente, el analisis discriminante extrae las dimensiones que permiten una mejor diferenciacion entre los grupos, asi como su correspondiente capacidad de clasificacion.\nSe confirma, asimismo, el papel modulador de determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas (discapacidad, estres percibido, experiencia de un brote reciente y problemas para dormir) sobre un amplio abanico de dimensiones psicologicas y neuropsicologicas, evidenciandose la configuracion de patrones especificos de expresion en casa caso. Tambien se corrobora el papel mediador del apoyo social en la relacion que se establece entre la discapacidad y el malestar emocional, asi como la capacidad de mediacion del afrontamiento orientado a la emocion y el neuroticismo en la asociacion entre el estres y las variables de resultado (sintomas psicologicos y calidad de vida). Por ultimo, se detallan las interacciones entre las variables contempladas en el estudio, de modo que puedan discernirse las relaciones de covariacion que se establecen entre todas ellas en aras de una comprension mas profunda de la experiencia interna del paciente.\n CONCLUSION\nLa EM es una enfermedad compleja, que presenta un evidente impacto sobre la salud mental de la persona que la sufre. La presente tesis doctoral extrae algunas de las principales necesidades asistenciales (incluyendo el modo en que determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas durante el proceso de enfermedad pueden modular la experiencia subjetiva del paciente) y explora las interacciones entre variables de relevancia clinica (incluyendose las relaciones con el deterioro cognitivo), de modo que pueda incrementarse el conocimiento disponible sobre la enfermedad desde la perspectiva de la salud mental. Los analisis de mediacion determinan que tanto el apoyo social como el estilo de afrontamiento emocional (dos dimensiones susceptibles de abordaje terapeutico) tienen un importante papel explicativo en la relacion que se objetiva entre la discapacidad y el estres con la sintomatologia psicologica y la calidad de vida. \nLos resultados obtenidos permiten incrementar el conocimiento actual sobre los aspectos psicologicos y neuropsicologicos de la EM, y ofrecer herramientas para el diseno de un plan de tratamiento orientado a este colectivo.",

Pain is always a personal experience that is influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological, and social factors. Pain cannot be inferred solely from activity in sensory neurons. Verbal description is only one of several behaviors to express pain; inability to communicate does not negate the possibility that a human or a non-human animal experiences pain. Many disease processes give rise to both nociceptive and neuropathic pain at the same time. Chronic primary pain is chronic pain in one or more anatomical regions, and is characterised by significant emotional distress or functional disability and can include forms of chronic pelvic pain.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Our internal balance, or homeostasis, is threatened or perceived as threatened by stressful stimuli, the stressors. The stress system is a highly conserved system that adjusts homeostasis to the resting state. Through the concurrent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the locus coeruleus/norepinephrine-autonomic nervous systems, the stress system provides the appropriate physical and behavioral responses, collectively termed as “stress response”, to restore homeostasis. If the stress response is prolonged, excessive or even inadequate, several acute or chronic stress-related pathologic conditions may develop in childhood, adolescence and adult life. On the other hand, earlylife exposure to stressors has been recognized as a major contributing factor underlying the pathogenesis of non-communicable disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders. Accumulating evidence suggests that early-life stress has been associated with an increased risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder in the offspring, although findings are still controversial. Nevertheless, at the molecular level, early-life stressors alter the chemical structure of cytosines located in the regulatory regions of genes, mostly through the addition of methyl groups. These epigenetic modifications result in the suppression of gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. In addition to DNA methylation, several lines of evidence support the role of non-coding RNAs in the evolving field of epigenetics. In this review article, we present the anatomical and functional components of the stress system, discuss the proper, in terms of quality and quantity, stress response, and provide an update on the impact of early-life stress on child development and behavior.",

Cardiac disease often limits exercise capacity when the heart is unable to increase forward cardiac output (CO) sufficiently. Abnormal peripheral circulation contributes to inadequate skeletal muscle perfusion and fatigue during exercise.

Insomnia or Nidranasha, is not just about being not getting proper sleep but it means that the nervous system has been weakened and reduces our ability to cope up with daily sleep. Insomnia is named as Nidranasha, happens due to vitiation of Kapha, Pitta and Vata dosha. Proper and deep sleep helps the person keep Energetic, Enthusiastic, does Brumhana, increases the Bala, increases vigour and vitality and most it keeps the Mind in stable state for gaining knowledge. Insomnia means inability to get sleep at night or inability to have a restful and sound sleep. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Arthritis, menopause, and certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Treatment of Insomnia:- Panchakarma â€“ Taila dhara a type of Shirodhara is very much useful in combacting the Insomnia caused due to various above said disorders.

      "title": "1001 A Case of Unusual Nocturnal Movements Consistent with Paroxysmal Hypnogenic Dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) is a rare subset of paroxysmal dyskinesias characterized by recurring involuntary dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that occur during sleep or immediately after an arousal from sleep. These episodes often occur without loss of consciousness or trigger and lack association with epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Report of case(s) A 61-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea compliant with PAP was referred for abnormal nighttime movements for the past 9 years. The episodes were characterized by stereotyped involuntary dystonic posturing involving his upper extremities or his entire body lasting up to 15 seconds. The onset of the events occurred invariable during nighttime sleep and resulted in awakenings from sleep. He denied dream enactment as well as other symptoms suggestive of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. Sleep deprived EEG demonstrated left temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness and captured a typical event that occurred during NREM stage II sleep and had no ictal correlate. An MRI of the brain was unremarkable. During overnight polysomnogram, his current PAP settings were found to be effective, and three episodes of body stiffening consistent with his typical events were captured. These episodes were found to occur after awakening from REM sleep and lasted less than 10 seconds each. There was no EEG correlate, and REM atonia was preserved throughout. The patient was started on oxcarbazepine for the nocturnal movements, which reduced the frequency of events from 12 to 4 events per night. Oxcarbazepine was tapered and discontinued due to side effects and incomplete control of the events. Genetic testing for epilepsy syndromes is pending. Conclusion PHD is a rare syndrome of involuntary movements which begin during sleep or cause awakenings from sleep and can be misdiagnosed as a sleep disorder. It is crucial for the sleep physician to be aware of possible neurological causes of sleep-related movement disorders. Furthermore, our patient’s partial response to oxcarbazepine may further support that PHD may have an epileptic origin although not well characterized.

      "abstract": "Polysomnography is a whole-night simultaneous recording of several physiological parameters related to sleep and wakefulness. According to the classical standards for sleep stage scoring, it is necessary to record the electroencephalogram, the electrooculogram and electromyogram while a comprehensive sleep laboratory assessment should use a recording of a great number of physiological parameters. Polysomnographic characteristics of the whole-night sleep are described and illustrated in this review. Sleep without rapid eye movements or nonREM sleep consists of four stages that form a continuum from superticial to deep sleep. Sleep with rapid eye movements or REM sleep is characterized by a low amplitude electroencephalographic (EEG) activity with mixed fast frequencies, muscle atonia and episodes of rapid eye movements. Main indications for polysomnography are various sleep disorders, including dyssomnias, circadian rhythm disorders, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, sleep apnea syndrome, parasomnia, forensic psychiatric cases related to sleep, depression, sleep-related epilepsies, periodic leg movements during sleep. Sleep medicine is a multidisciplinary field including many medical disciplines, from psychiatry and neurology to intern medicine and paediatrics, as well as other sciences (from biology and genetics to psychology).",

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

While etiologic foundations of this condition are still unclear, it is well known that 24h-driven biological (circadian) rhythms are basic physiological requirements for the homeostatic control of peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle, bone and particularly cartilage. Sleep, as the most conspicuous circadian rhythm rooling health and welbeing, is also relevant for anabolic and catabolic processes within cartilage, with nocturnal sleep regulating other factors from which depend important metabolic pathways . Pain, which is chronically coupled to OA is not only impacted by both circadian rhythms and sleep but is itself a contributor to circadian misalignment and sleep disruption which therefore increase pain propensity maintaining a deleterious vicious cycle. Hence, knowledge on such interactive structural and functional composition should be of great relevance both for preventing and successfully treating this chronic, debilitating, neurodegenerative disorder. Methods Authors are reporting an interesting case of a patient in which circadian disruption, impaired sleep and exacerbated persistent pain co-ocur within OA.

      "title": "The Role of AD Bio-Phyto-Dynamic Modulators in Treatment of Degenerative and Self-Immune Diseases of Locomotion System",
      "abstract": "The diseases of the locomotion system are the most frequent ones that generate long convalescence periods because of pain, sometimes associated with functional impotence. The effects of bio-phyto-dynamic modulators are fast, especially in the situations when the treatment includes all the suggestions, persisting in time, having a much faster implication at the beginning of the disease. The Universe is an energetic space in which the human being is influenced by pulsing magnetic-electrical fields permanently, because they intersect and influence the individual regularly. The human body is a masterpiece of nature, scheduled to live about 100-120 years, but it disappears before, as a result of the deterioration of its energetic structure beyond the toleration limits. Once the problems of physical body diseases occur, the organism is already in an advanced stage of disorders, rarely and only partially reversible. The factors that lead to the appearance of these types of energetic disturbances can be endo-genetic, exo-genetic or, in the most situations, mixed. Their impact on the energetic system can be brutal (acute) or insidious (chronic). The alterations of this system develop in a particular way and manifest depending on the aggression factors and on the initial state of the body. Referring to the initial state of human energy, as concerns the oriental medicine, the disease is not equivalent to the invasion (microbial, viral), but the body weakness that brings in the invasion . In other words as long as the energetic system of the human body is unaffected, the aggressions which belong to our usual environment will not be capable to lead to disease appearance. The deficiency of the energetic system can be a hereditary heritage or, most frequently, gained. The gained susceptibility for disease often refers to a fissure placed in the immune energetic system of the organism, a system in which the access of the external energies to the internal side of human body is more possible and aggressive. Many situations show that the gained susceptibility is an apparent deterioration of many points of the energetic network, most frequently as a result of a non-balanced alimentation, of the inadequate breathing, of body exposure to the external energies (the lack of sun exposure, prolonged staying in a cold or wet environment, in the electromagnetic area of mobile phones or of performance technology etc) or of non-respecting the biological stages. The possibility of quantification of the energetic system reserves for every individual by electro- acupuncture or the non-linear analyse and the public access to these top technologies as an energetic diagnose represent a superior stage of energetic medicine. At the same time these miraculous instruments help us infinitely to evaluate the patient and",

It affects 35% of the general population, according to the 1984 report of the National Institutes of Mental Health (1). Insomnia is not defined by total sleep time but by the inability to obtain sleep of sufficient length or quality to produce refreshment the following morning. For example, a person who needs only 4 hours of sleep does not have insomnia if he or she is refreshed in the morning after having 4 hours of sleep, whereas someone who needs 10 hours of sleep may have insomnia if he or she does not feel refreshed even after 8 hours of sleep. Contrary to popular lore, psychiatric or psychological factors are not the most frequent causes of insomnia. Insomnias can be divided into two major categories: the primary insomnias and the secondary insomnias. As discussed elsewhere in this volume, primary insomnias are conditions in which the insomnia is the main pathophysiological process, whereas secondary insomnias are conditions where the insomnia is a symptom of another disorder.",

      "abstract": "Sensory deprivation speeds up the degenerative changes normally associated with aging and enhances the loss of functional cells in the central nervous system. Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

      "title": "Exercise Intervention in Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "Physical exercise offers a unique, non-pharmacological, non-invasive yet habit-strengthening, intervention that integrates different schedules/branches, whether of an endurance or resistance type, that may be ‘taylored’ for both individuals who have suffered brain trauma or healthy individuals. In any case, it presents a critical requirement for an “empowered” lifestyle. The necessity of individuals’ activity regime is linked to the assurance of normal, healthy developmental trajectories for structure and function over the complete lifespan of individuals, as evidenced from global public health physical activity guidelines. It restores the healthy homeostatic regulation of stress, cognitive-emotional affective status and the balance of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis together the amelioration or reversal of performance deficits observed in neurocognitive tasks under conditions of neurologic or psychiatric disorder. Under conditions mechanical infliction, exercise protects against vascular risk factors that include hypertension, diabetes, cellular inflammation and aortic rigidity through inducing direct changes to cerebrovasculature that involve beneficial changes in cerebral blood flow, angiogenesis and redemption from vascular disease which imply optimal brain plasticity. Essentially, physical exercise, maintained regularly even daily, may underpin the scaffolding constructions of the brain’s adaptive process by facilitating the reinforcement and reinstatement of existing networks, circuits and pathways that, although damaged, provide the substrate for reconstruction following injury [1]. For rehabilitationary measures following injuries to the brain exercise has proven useful although caution must be maintained since premature initiation of a program may aggravate symptoms and retrogress outcome [2]. A single section of exercise, independent of intensity, was found to induce a positive outcome for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, by (i) increasing positive feelings and (ii) reducing negative feelings [3]. Physical activity/exercise may ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal loss, reduce neuroinflammation, and facilitate recovery after brain injury. Brain trauma, whether mild, moderate or severe, depending on cause and severity, may be accompanied by headache, of varying intensity, dizziness, loss of consciousness, blurred vision, hearing impediment, confusion, memory loss, seizure activity, paralysis and coma as the first-noticed symptoms, with expectation of damage to blood-brain-barrier integrity, accelerated apoptosis and excitotoxicity. All of these signs and symptoms in various combinations, intensities, locations and stages will determine the extent of short-term and long-term destruction of physical, motor, cognitive, behavioral and emotional domains. Analyses of individual diagnoses from 57 studies meeting the inclusion criteria indicated that individuals presenting previous TBI showed higher odds (risk) of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, depression, mixed affective disorders, and bipolar disorder compared with to those individuals without TBI [4]. TBI may be presented as primary and secondary injury responses; the former represents immediate mechanical damge that appears at the moment of impact, and involves brain contusion, laceration, haemorrhage, axon transection and diffuse axonal injury whereas the latter, which progresses over hours, days and months, represents glutamate excitotoxicity, ionic gradient disturbances, metabolic disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species formation, neuroinflammation and hypoxic-ischenic damage [5,6]. The secondary responses naturally exacerbate the primary responses [7,8]. Physical exercise exerts multiple interventional effects upon the destructive effects of TBI that extend from anti-apoptotic effects through reinstatement of cerebrovascular integrity to augmentation of neuroplasticity at cellular, circuit, regional and behavioral levels with greater dividends arising from the proactive implementation over the reactive initiation [9]. In this regard, delaying the initiation of exercise schedules ought to be avoided since complete rest exceeding three days is less advantageous to patient recovery, gradual resumption of pre-injury activities",

      "abstract": "Insomnia complaints increase with age and are frequently made by elderly people. Recently non-pharmacological treatments have been proposed more often, among which stimulus control. One of the stimulus control instructions is the advice not to nap in the daytime, based on the assumption that napping affects sleep quality the following night, due to a decrease of sleep need. This article discusses the function of napping and the impact of napping on sleep. The decline of sleep duration during aging is not due to a disturbance of the endogenous circadian rhythm but rather to a decrease of the physiological sleep need. Naps do not have the function to compensate for the decreased sleep duration but to meet an increased psychological sleep need. During daytime elderly people are physiologically less sleepy than young adults, who, nevertheless, sleep on average longer. Napping does not negatively affect sleep. Consequently, the assumption on which the advice against napping is based is wrong.",

      "title": "Role of Biomarkers in Early Detection of Heterotopic Ossification following Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) is a partial or total disruption of the structural or functional integrity of the spinal cord following non-traumatic or traumatic cause leads to temporary or permanent impairment of motor, sensory and/or autonomic functions. \r\nThe spinal cord functions mainly in the transmission of neural signals between the brain and the target organs in the body but also contains neural circuits that can independently control numerous reflexes and central pattern generators. The disruption of these neurohumoral functions following spinal cord injury results in various acute and chronic secondary complications. There is a wide range of short and long term complications like Heterotopic Ossifications, spasticity, deep venous thrombosis, osteoporosis etc. \r\nHeterotopic ossification (HO) is defined as ‘formation of mature, lamellar bone in non-osseous tissue, usually between the muscle and the joint capsule’. This happens as a consequence of various conditions and trauma. These include neurological injuries like spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, post surgical intervention at the particular joint and direct injury to the muscle. \r\nThe exact cause of HO is not clear till date though the research has been well advanced in this field. The widely accepted concept is transformation of primitive mesenchymal cells which are present in the connective tissue into bone forming cells called osteoblasts when exposed to certain inducing agents(1). The exact sequence of events that lead to ectopic bone formation, the proper etiology and predisposing factors are still under exploration. \r\nEarly identification of this particular condition has always been a challenge. As the condition develops over a period of time with non specific complaints at the local site and occasionally mild constitutional symptoms; clinical suspicion needs to be tailored with proper investigation to achieve diagnosis at the earliest. It is well established that the medical treatment is most effective only when the patient receives it before the radiological evidence of bone formation. There are various laboratory biomarkers like alkaline phosphatase(ALP), creatine phosphokinase, osteocalcin and radiological tools including the use of ultra sound examination in early detection of HO have been reported in the literature. Three phase bone scan is widely accepted as Gold standard(2–4). \r\nCurrently pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for HO. Disodium Etidronate (Didronel), a non nitrogenous bisphosphonate was the drug of choice for both prophylaxis and treatment as it can slow down the mineralization process(5). Didronel is expected to be effective in early stage of the disease(3). Other medications like NSAIDs, Warfarin(6,7), glucocorticoids are also in use. Indomethacin is used most commonly which is shown to be effective in the prevention of HO especially when the patient receives during the first two months after the spinal cord injury even before the clinical features appear(8–10). Low field irradiation showed some response when used as the primary treatment once first clinical signs were observed(11–13). The surgical intervention is the last resort available when the HO becomes fully mature. The complication rate is high for the surgical resection which includes increased bleeding and recurrence. \r\nAIM OF THE STUDY: \r\nEarly detection of heterotopic ossification in spinal cord injury patients through biomarkers. \r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\n1. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of CPK in early detection of heterotopic ossification in spinal cord injury patients. \r\n2. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of osteocalcin in early detection of heterotopic ossification in spinal cord injury patients. \r\n3. To compare serum CPK, osteocalcin levels in early detection of heterotopic ossification following spinal cord injury. \r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nStudy design:\r\nProspective, diagnostic pilot study in a spinal cord injury patients’ cohort group. \r\nSetting for the study: \r\nThe study was done in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) of Christian Medical College Hospital (CMCH), Vellore. CMCH Vellore is a tertiary care centre located in Tamil Nadu, India. This centre has an inpatient capacity of about 2,700 beds. The number of patients attending OPD each day is approximately 5000. The PM&R department of CMCH, Vellore has approximately 130 beds and its outpatient department serves around 100 patients every day. Nearly 300 patients with spinal cord injury are rehabilitated in a year. Around 20-40% of these admissions are diagnosed to have heterotopic ossification. \r\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics committee of Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore. \r\nParticipants:\r\nIndividuals with paraplegia and quadriplegia secondary to traumatic spinal cord injury classified as ASIA-A, ASIA-B, ASIA-C and ASIA-D from January 2013 to June 2014were involved in the study. \r\nInclusion criteria: \r\n18-60yr old male and female patients after 3 weeks of spinal cord injury attending outpatient and inpatient sections of Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Emergency Department and Department of Spinal disorders of Christian Medical College Hospital, Vellore were included in this study after informed consent. \r\nExclusion criteria: \r\n1. Patients with recent history (one week) of medical/surgical conditions which tend to raise the serum levels of ALP or CPK such as rhabdomyolysis, muscular dystrophy, myoscitis, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, hypothyroidism, severe orthopedic trauma, disorders of bile duct obstruction, celiac disease, muscle hematomas, or organ tear were excluded from the study. \r\n2. Patients with existing ossification around hip joints/ bone pathology at the time of initial screening by pelvis X- ray were not included. \r\n3. Individuals who have had hip fracture after the recruitment which is radiologically proven were excluded from the study. \r\n4. Children and pregnant women were also excluded. \r\nMethodology:\r\nALP, CPK and Osteocalcin were measured at around 3rd, 7th, 11th and 16th week of the injury. Osteocalcin samples are stored under -70°C to prevent the wastage of the reagent kit till the end of the study. Base line hip x-ray was checked for every patient at the time of recruitment. All the blood samples were tested as per the standard operating procedures mentioned in the annexure. We interpreted the biomarker values as per the reference ranges established in CMCH Vellore Laboratory. The images of the reference standard i.e. Triple phase Technetium-99m bone scan were interpreted by nuclear medicine physician. The test results were not interpreted using clinical data from participants. \r\nStatistical Analysis:\r\nThe final results were compared and analyzed with two sided Fisher Exact test using SPSS software. We found there is no significant correlation of CPK values at different weeks with the later developing heterotopic ossification in the four patients and ALP values at different weeks showed there is no specific co relation with the HO that was noticed after 16weeks. \r\nCONCLUSIONS;\r\n1. CPK may not be a good early biochemical marker for diagnosing the HO in spinal cord injury patients. The rising trend may not be observed in all patients who develop HO implying its poor quality to assess the HO maturity. \r\n2. ALP can be serially monitored to check the osteoblastic activity only in the context of absence of bone injury. Interpretation of ALP values in first four months of the injury should be done carefully. \r\n3. Osteocalcin in spinal cord injury patients is not a good tool in predicting the future developing HO.",

      "abstract": "Le syndrome douloureux régional complexe de type 1 (SDRC 1) est caractérisé par des douleurs chroniques associées à des troubles vasomoteurs et/ou trophiques et/ou sudomoteurs témoignant d’une hyperactivité sympathique. Les formes pédiatriques de SDRC 1 se distinguent des formes adultes : les douleurs sont majoritairement localisées aux membres inférieurs (cheville, pied) et surviennent après un traumatisme mineur. Les enfants se présentent le plus souvent avec une forme froide d’emblée. Les douleurs entraînent une impotence fonctionnelle majeure et prolongée, ce qui contraste avec l’absence ou la banalité de la lésion sous-jacente. Les retentissements sont rapidement importants et concernent tous les domaines de la vie de l’enfant : perte d’autonomie, troubles du sommeil, anxiété, dépression, altération des liens sociaux et familiaux, absentéisme scolaire…Le diagnostic reste clinique, sur la base des critères de Budapest, même s’ils n’ont pas été validés en pédiatrie. Le traitement repose sur une réhabilitation fonctionnelle grâce à la physiothérapie associée à une prise en charge psychothérapeutique. L’objectif est de remobiliser le membre douloureux de manière progressive et adaptée, sans attendre la sédation complète de la douleur, et de limiter les retentissements de la douleur au quotidien. Les antalgiques peuvent parfois être utiles, mais doivent être surveillés de manière étroite. Cette prise en charge est ambulatoire initialement, mais lorsque les douleurs sont trop intenses et entraînent des retentissements importants, une hospitalisation doit être proposée. Enfin, l’évolution semble meilleure que chez les adultes même si environ 20 % des enfants rechutent dans les six premiers mois le plus souvent.",

Properly monitored and managed, the stress response contributes to a state of optimum health and well being. When improperly managed, the stress response may lead to a variety of medical, psychological and behavioral health problems. These problems range from cigarette smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, violence, and family conflict to insomnia, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and ulcers. However, there are several stressful activities, including aerobic exercise, weight training, and flexibility training, which contribute to a number of health benefits. There are some individual differences in personality dimensions, sex, etc., which moderate the stress-health relationship.",

      "abstract": "Frequently disrupted and restricted sleep is a widespread problem in our modern around-theclock society. In the long run, insufficient sleep may have serious repercussions for health and well-being. Indeed, sleep complaints and restricted sleep have been identified as risk factors for various diseases including, for example, mood disorders such as depression. One pathway along which restricted sleep might affect the sensitivity to disease is by altering central and neuroendocrine stress systems. The stress systems in our brain and body play a critical role in adapting to a continuously changing and challenging environment. Stress hormones not only support metabolic processes and physical activity under acute stress but also affect brain function, cognition and mood. Therefore, effects of sleep loss on these stress systems may have direct functional consequences for the way we perform and deal with everyday challenges. The present study in rats examined the effect of chronic partial sleep deprivation on the sensitivity of the serotonin-1A (5HT-1A) receptor system and the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor system. Both of these systems play an important role in coordinating stress responses, which includes regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis, one of the main neuroendocrine stress systems. Also, alterations in both the serotonergic and CRH system have been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression.",

Sleep disturbances include hypersomnia and hyposomnia, sleep fragmentation, difficulty falling asleep, and altered electroencephalograms. TBI results in inflammation and altered hemodynamics, such as changes in blood brain barrier permeability and cerebral blood flow. Both inflammation and altered hemodynamics, which are known sleep regulators, contribute to sleep impairments post-TBI. TBIs are heterogenous in cause and biomechanics, which leads to different molecular and symptomatic outcomes. Animal models of TBI have been developed to model the heterogeneity of TBIs observed in the clinic. This review discusses the intricate relationship between sleep, inflammation, and hemodynamics in pre-clinical rodent models of TBI.",

      "title": "Human consciousness and sleep/waking rhythms: A review and some neuropsychological considerations",
      "abstract": "Abstract The relevance of sleep/waking rhythms to issues of human consciousness is reviewed from data in the literature and from personal studies. Consciousness is often considered to be markedly attenuated or absent in sleep. There is, however, much evidence for a rich subjective experience during sleep, much of which is not recalled later. This implies that William James' \"stream of consciousness\" persists continuously throughout sleep as well as wakefulness, but that problems of memory recall interfere with its being reported as such. Sleeping subjects show selective awareness of external stimuli, with significant stimuli generally leading to awakening and relatively nonsignificant stimuli, at least at times, being incorporated into the ongoing mental activity of REM or NREM sleep. Mentation throughout sleep is characterized by a high degree of autonomy and little willful control. Creative insight and problem solving of a very high order may occur in sleep and involve either dreaming or thought-like mentation. Parameters of waking consciousness show possibly sleep-related rhythmic fluctuations at both circadian (24 hr sleep/ waking) and ultradian (90–120 min, NREM/REM sleep) rates. Moreover, waking consciousness is markedly influenced by the quality of temporal stability of preceding sleep. A substantial number of so-called \"altered states of consciousness\" is found to involve primarily or exclusively dysfunction of sleep/waking mechanisms. Cerebral lesions can produce selective impairment of aspects of sleep mentation. It is concluded that further analysis of subjective awareness in sleep or in partial sleep states is very relevant and indeed vital to a more comprehensive understanding of human consciousness.",

It results from an excessive stimulation of eccrine sweat glands in the skin by the sympathetic nervous system. Hyperhidrosis may be primary or secondary to an underlying cause. Nocturnal hyperhidrosis is associated with different sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement during sleep and narcolepsy. The major cause of the hyperhidrosis is sympathetic overactivity and, in the case of narcolepsy type 1, orexin deficiency may also contribute. In this narrative review, we will provide an outline of the possible mechanisms underlying sudomotor dysfunction and the resulting nocturnal hyperhidrosis in these different sleep disorders and explore its clinical relevance.",

      "abstract": "Background: Overactive bladder syndrome is a urinary disorder that occurs more frequently in women andolder people and is characterized by feeling an urge to urinate (sudden urge to urinate, with the feeling thatyou cannot get to the bathroom in time), doing it many times throughout the day (more than six) or havingepisodes of urinary incontinence (involuntary loss of urine) and nocturia (waking up several times duringthe night to urinate). In addition, other secondary symptoms may also occur, such as headache, dry mouth orblurred vision, among others. It is a problem that has a clear impact on the quality of life of those who sufferit and that can lead them to significantly reduce their social activity and negatively condition their work.Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence,nocturia, and/or frequency in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology. Sacral neuromodulation is anewer surgical therapy for refractory OAB.Aim of Study: Is to assess the sacral neuromodulation (SN) safety and efficacy in refractory overactivebladder patients.Patients and Methods: In the period from November 2015 to May 2017. the unit of neurogenic bladderand neuromodulation in (Gazi Al_Harriry) surgical specialty hospital, medical city complex 27 patient agedfrom (17—55) year old were complaining from refractory overactive bladder. All the 27 patients underwentstage1 &amp; stage2 SNS devices implantation.Results: Patients of urgency incontinence (group1) demonstrated that the number of leak was significantlyreduced (p=0.01) after implantation of SN, (11.6_2.7) leak/day pre&amp; post SN, numbers of pads (6.9 _ 0.8)pad/day pre&amp;post SN. Patients with urgency frequency (group 2), numbers of voids/day pre &amp; post SNimplantation decreased significantly (p=0.01) (14.7 _ 6) voids /day. The voided volume increased significantly(p=0.02) from (136.4 _ 371.8) ml/void. The urgency episodes were decreased significantly (p=0.01) from(6.4 _ 2.1) episode/day. The complications occurred in 5 patients (18.5%). Two patients (7.4%) developedpain after trauma to the back, lead migration, lack of efficacy of device, treated by reprogramming thedevice, one patient (3.7%) get infection at the site of device implantation, SN was removed , there was onefemale patient (3.7%) got pregnancy and devise was deactivated. One patient (3.7%) complaining from painand discomfort at the device site was treated conservatively.Conclusion: Sacral neuromodulation is FDA approved as option for treatment of refractory OAB. There isexpanding of utilizing of SN in the past two decades. According to multiple studies in addition to our studyresults. The sacral neuromodulation is safe and efficacious treatment option for refractory OAB.",

People suffering of mood disorders (e.g., depression) show delays in the onset of sleep, awakenings during sleep, or sleepiness at daytime. Inversely, people experiencing circadian misalignment (e.g., jet lag, shift work) exhibit mood-related symptoms, emphasizing the reciprocal connection between affective and circadian disorders. Moreover, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments that improve daily rhythms have important benefit effects in emotional states, indicating that the circadian system is a good entrance for the successful treatment of mood disorders. Thereby, to understand the physiological mechanisms underlying mood alterations induced by disruptions of daily physiology, it is important to develop and use valid animal models that simulate human circadian activity.",

Exposure to high levels of negatively affects several organ systems in human body and thus causes nervousness, sleep disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cognitive impairment in children. The effect of on human auditory system is especially important because of the irreversibility of created changes. Noise-induced hearing loss is the most common preventable cause of hearing loss. Also, this is the most prevalent occupational disease in the United States of America. Pathophysiologically, the cause of noise-induced hearing loss is damage of the cochlear hair cells. Such damage can be caused by an exposure to one brief, very intense sound (acoustic trauma) or by chronic exposure to elevated levels of noise. Acute effect of on hearing is clinically presented with transient tinnitus, the sensation of ear fullness and muffled sounds, but chronic damage is not accompanied by overt symptoms like pain or bleeding and there is no easily noticeable deformation. Hearing impairments caused by are diagnosed by pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and otoacoustic emissions. Characteristic finding for noise-induced hearing loss is a noise notch at a frequency of 4 kHz on a pure tone audiogram. Therapeutic approach in noise-induced hearing loss is based on non-pharmaceutical measures of improving patient's quality of life, for instance, with hearing aids. Drugs, gene therapy, and stem cell therapy are intensely researched as potential methods for hair cell regeneration or hair cell death prevention. The only effective way to combat this condition is prevention. Main methods of prevention are education, law regulations, and use of personal hearing protection devices.",

Nurses on twelve-hour shifts worked much harder, were more tired after work and suffered from sleep disorders. Rotation of shifts was of no significance for development of fatigue and insomnia. Occupational stress resulted first of all in greater fatigue, and next in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Energetic aspect is common for both work fatigue and emotional exhaustion.

Daytime sleepiness is a typical complaint of sleep apnea patients and has generally been thought to result from the repeated arousals during nighttime sleep that are necessary to breathe, i.e., nighttime sleep of apneic patients is fragmented and not refreshing. Although the daytime sleepiness can occur at any time of the day, it most commonly occurs during the afternoon or early evening. The observation that naps do not usually provide relief from feelings of daytime sleepiness suggests that factors other than nighttime sleep fragmentation may be involved. In this chapter, we ﬁrst brieﬂy review data indicating that cytokines are involved in sleep regulation. We then present evidence that some effects of sleep apnea may include alterations in cytokine proﬁles. Finally, we conclude by speculating that alterations in cytokine concentrations/proﬁles may be one of several causal factors of the daytime sleepiness typically associated with sleep apnea.",

      "abstract": "Intoxication is the deterioration of body functions due to different toxic substances. Poisoning by drugs constitutes an important part of all poisonings. Symptoms such as altered consciousness, tachycardia/bradycardia, or hypertension/hypotension may be seen because the cardiovascular system is affected. Changes in clinical findings and ECG may be revealed according to the degree of heart involvement. Rapid recognition and effective intervention by the emergency physician are of great importance. This review considers the use of ECG in the management of poisoned patients. Systematic evaluation of the ECG in a patient followed up with poisoning is essential for details that may be overlooked. Velocity, rhythm, intervals, and segments, QRS, wave morphologies, durations, ischemic changes should be followed carefully.&#x0D; When performing rhythm analysis, clues to drug cardiotoxicity should be sought in unstable patients. Are there ectopic beats on the EKG? The answer to this question may carry important clues. Automaticity caused by sympathomimetics may underlie ectopic beats. This may be the first sign of a problem caused by acute coronary syndrome or electrolyte disturbances. Is the rhythm supraventricular? or ventricular? Is bradycardia with AV block? Or without AV block? Is tachycardia narrow complex? Or is it a large complex? Answers to questions such as: For life-threatening rhythms, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and complete AV-block, the guidelines developed should be followed, and first intervention should be made. Agents that can cause tachycardia; are sympathomimetics (methamphetamine), anticholinergics (antidepressants, antipsychotics), class 1A and 1C antidysrhythmics, and TCA. Agents that can cause bradycardia; calcium channel / beta blockers / digoxin (AV block), opioids / ethanol, organophosphates, lithium. Prolonging the PR interval may indicate beta-adrenergic antagonism, calcium channel antagonism, or digoxin poisoning. Typical ECG of TCA poisoning shows sinus tachycardia with first-degree AV block, wide QRS complexes, and positive R' wave in aVR. The ECG should be taken and evaluated in patients presenting with poisoning within the first 10 minutes. Suppose the poisoning agent is an agent that influences the cardiovascular system. In that case, it should be kept in mind that continuous cardiac monitoring and control ECG evaluation should be performed in addition to the application of ECG.",

      "title": "1183 Chasing Sleep: Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder - Free-Running Type",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, free-running type (CRSD-FRT) is a disorder caused by a circadian pacemaker that is out of sync with the 24-hour light-dark cycle. CRSD-FRT is rare in sighted persons but prevalent in totally blind individuals. In sighted people, CRSD-FRT can be associated with psychiatric conditions such as depression, but the etiology remains unknown. It is postulated that sighted persons may have reduced light sensitivity for phase-resetting effects. Symptoms of CRSD-FRT include insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and functional impairment. Here we present a unique case of CRSD-FRT in a sighted female with a history of depression. Report of case(s) A 27-year-old sighted female with history of depression previously treated with an SSRI presented to the sleep clinic with a chief complaint of chronic insomnia. Historically, she went to bed at 3 A.M. and awoke at 2 P.M. Sleep onset latency was normal. Estimated total sleep time was 10 hours. She denied history of any other sleep disorders. She experienced a similar delayed sleep routine as a teenager and assumed it was due to late-night gaming. She tried multiple sleep aids including trazodone, melatonin, and diphenhydramine, unsuccessfully. She described a “normal” sleeping schedule once per month, but then her sleep schedule began to move later and later, until it was normal again. She worked from home and was self-employed, giving her flexibility over her schedule. Her Epworth Sleepiness Score was 13 at the initial visit. Interestingly, her sibling had a similar sleeping pattern. Actigraphy was done which confirmed patient’s diagnosis of CRSD-FRT. She was advised to start Tasimelteon. Conclusion The patient was previously misdiagnosed with insomnia. CRSD-FRT is rare in sighted persons and may be underdiagnosed. Our patient’s CRSD-FRT may be linked to her history of depression and SSRI use. According to one study, a clinical dose of SSRI resulted in 47% increase in melatonin suppression, which increases the human circadian system’s responsiveness to light. Her flexible work from home schedule may also be a contributing factor. When changing or eliminating social time cues could precipitate the development of CRSD-FRT due to variations in the length of circadian rhythm. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Abstract Complaints about sleep are common in elderly adults. While changes in sleep architecture occur with normal aging, complaints about sleep are often related to pathological and treatable sleep disturbances. Primary sleep disturbances occurring in older adults include circadian rhythm disturbances, insomnia, sleep disordered breathing, rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and periodic limb movements in sleep. Particularly in older adults, sleep disturbances are likely to represent a multifactorial syndrome in which medical illness, psychiatric illness, and medications play a role. Sleep complaints necessitate the attention of the clinician as they are associated with poor outcomes. Because treatment strategies differ depending on the etiology of the sleep disturbance, a careful and systematic approach to diagnosis is crucial. This chapter reviews the normal changes in sleep that occur with age and sleep disorders frequently seen in older adults including in those with major neurocognitive disorders/dementia. Diagnosis and treatment strategies are discussed.",

      "title": "From Acute to Chronic Pain: Peripheral and Central Mechanisms",
      "abstract": "I. INTRODUCTION Perhaps the most significant advance in the field of pain research has been the realization that pain is not a single sensory experience and that the different forms of pain are mediated by different neurological mechanisms. Some years ago we proposed a conceptual framework and a series of models that addressed the mechanisms of both acute and chronic pain and the interrelation between different pain states (1). We argued that the neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for all of the various pain states are different and that normal (nociceptive) and abnormal (neuropathic) pain represent the endpoints of a sequence of possible changes that can occur in the nervous system. Normally, a steady state is maintained in which there is a close correlation between injury and pain. However, changes or oscillations induced by nociceptive input or by changes in the environment can result in variations in the quality and quantity of pain sensation produced by a particular noxious stimulus. Such changes would be temporary, unless there was further noxious input, as the system would always tend to restore the normal balance between injury and pain. However, long-lasting or very intense nociceptive input or the removal of a portion of the normal input would distort the nociceptive system to such an extent that the close correlation between injury and pain would be lost.",

Gemeint sind Veränderungen im Sozialverhalten, die in der Partnerschaft, der Familie, dem Freundeskreis und in der Arbeit als „störend“ oder als „befremdlich“ empfunden werden. Die Betroffenen halten sich zum Beispiel nicht mehr wie zuvor an die Regeln und Gepflogenheiten der sozialen Gemeinschaft. Solche Veränderungen werden häufig nicht als Symptom einer Erkrankung oder Verletzung erkannt. Die Folgen einer Frontalhirnschädigung beinhalten äußerst vielfältige klinische Erscheinungsformen, die die Diagnostik und Therapie erschweren. Denn es gibt kaum standardisierte Tests oder Untersuchungsverfahren, mit denen das Sozialverhalten eines Menschen „objektiv“ gemessen werden könnte. In einem stark vereinfachten Modell der Verhaltenssteuerung zeigt der Artikel, wie es zu den unterschiedlichen Symptomen bei Frontalhirnschädigung kommen kann.",

      "abstract": "This is a narrative review of sleep disorders, especially chronic insomnia, as a primary diagnosis or as a comorbid diagnosis associated with different psychiatric and organic diseases. The epidemiological evidence is reviewed, the diagnostic criteria most frequently used in clinical practice are examined, and a series of therapeutic recommendations for the correct treatment of this pathology is presented. Sleep disorders are very prevalent in the general population (one-third experiences difficulty with sleep initiation/maintenance at least once a week, and about 6-15% meet the criteria for insomnia disorders), but remain relatively poorly understood and frequently overlooked by healthcare professionals. Prevalence estimates of insomnia disorder vary between 5% and 20%. Sleep disorders co-exist with psychiatric and medical conditions with an interactive and bidirectional relationship. About 70-80% of psychiatric patients show some sleep disturbance and there is a correlation between the severity of the sleep disturbance and the severity of the psychopathology. Untreated sleep disorders increase the risk of cardiovascular events, cognitive impairment, motor vehicle accidents, obesity, diabetes, and efficiency and safety at work, leading to increased all-cause healthcare utilization and being a strong predictor of sick leave or disability pension and poor quality of life. Sleep disorders can cause drowsiness or excessive daytime sleepiness, which can lead to functional impairment in 15% of the general adult population. Sleep quality should be a routine target in the evaluation of patients with psychiatric and non-psychiatric diseases to ensure sleep health based on early diagnosis and adequate therapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Burnout is a highly researched syndrome resulting from job stress. It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

There are three factors namely; mental breakdown, mental disturbances, and mental illness impair the mental health of employees. Stress is an unavoidable aspect of life. Workplace stress derives specifically from conditions in their workplace. This condition may either cause stress initially or aggravate the stress already present from other sources. Studies have pointed to the growth in non-standard work and other changing work patterns as contributing to a recent sharp increase in stress leads in the workplace. In organizations the ergonomic the concern is work stress, which in any action from an external source that affects the body. This creates a strain in the body resulting in some physiological response to the stress. Work stress due to unusual posture or improper postural adjustment to the work results in back pain, headaches, nervousness, aching muscles, excessive perspiration and depressions. The most serious result of work stress is serious traumatic injuries, accumulative injuries or death. Psychological factors that may cause stress are excessive heat, improper furniture (chairs, tables etc.), poor workplace, long work hours or any other type of situation in which individual performs his or her work in unusual situation or in a continuous manner. Ill health results in high rate of absenteeism and turnover, industrial discontent and indiscipline, poor performance and low productivity and more accidents. Besides, employee’s health also provides other benefits such as improved morale of employees, increased productivity of employees and also longer working period of an employee which, of course cannot be easily measured.",

Sleep abnormalities in depression are mainly characterized by increased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduced slow wave sleep. Among the mechanisms of sleep disturbances in depression are hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, CLOCK gene polymorphism and primary sleep disorders. The habenula is a structure regulating the activities of monoaminergic neurons in the brain. The hyperactivation of the habenula has also been implicated, together with sleep disturbances, in depression. The presence of depression in primary sleep disorders is common.

The notion of confusional arousals in children has received less attention overall compared with that concerning adults. The impression gained in adults is that, especially in response to forced awakenings, the behavioral disturbance in adult episodes is more forceful, vigorous and resistive, sometimes leading to violent behavior. Childhood confusional arousals do not usually require treatment, only advice to parents that they can be considered to be a passing phase. The same cannot necessarily be said of confusional arousals in adult life when they have more of a tendency to persist, depending on their etiology and relationship to other sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Despite its common comorbidity, sleep disturbance is often underrecognized and undertreated in individuals with anxiety disorders. Compared to mood disorders, sleep disturbance in this population is less well studied except for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Some evidence suggests a bidirectional link between anxiety disorders and sleep disturbance. Polysomnography findings point to some commonalities across anxiety disorders, including longer sleep onset latency, reduced total sleep time, and reduced sleep efficiency. The underlying biological mechanisms linking anxiety disorders and sleep disturbance are still unclear. However, there is limited evidence suggesting a connection between impaired executive functioning due to sleep problems and failure to inhibit anxiety related thoughts and feelings. Cortisol irregularities and disruption in the serotonergic system may also play a role. Evidence suggests that anxiety sensitivity is a transdiagnostic factor that contributes to both anxiety disorders and sleep disturbance. Further research is warranted to elucidate common biological and psychological factors underlying sleep disturbances and anxiety disorders. There is an imminent need to systematically assess the impact of sleep disturbance on symptom severity and treatment outcomes in anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and related disorders. Limited evidence is available for medications and targeted psychotherapeutic interventions for management of sleep disturbance thus warranting the development of robust sleep interventions to achieve optimal clinical outcomes in this patient population.",

      "abstract": "While insomnia can be a symptom of numerous mental and physical illnesses, it is frequently diagnosed as a sleep disorder in its own right, caused mainly by stressful life events or by non-synchronization of individuals' biological sleep-wake cycle with the one they choose to practice. Because of irregular work schedules, late-night entertainment, or rapid crossing of several time zones, individuals might retire to bed earlier or later than their biological bedtime, experiencing difficulties in falling asleep. The present paper develops a simple economic model of the bedtime decision, viewing the individual as a rational decision-maker who determines her insomnia level through consciously weighing the cost and benefit of deviating from her biological bedtime. The model is then used to examine the individual's response to stress, yielding a prediction which is consistent with observed behavior, although not with sleep therapists' recommendations. Finally, the model is applied to the case of transmeridian flights, explaining jet lag as a rational adjustment to a misalignment between the individual's slow-to-adapt internal clock and her external environment.",

      "title": "Sleep in Older Adults",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although the requirements for sleep do not appear to decline with aging, the ability to sleep and achieve consolidated sleep may decrease in some older adults. Approximately 50% of older adults complain of sleep disturbance. Older adults often take longer to fall asleep, have lower sleep efficiencies, and have more nighttime awakenings. They are also sleepier during the day than younger adults. Compared to elderly men, women are better able to maintain satisfactory sleep with aging. Aging is associated with changes in sleep architecture (Box 14–1). Greater nighttime sleep disturbance may lead to daytime sleepiness and more frequent daytime napping. Significant disturbances may occur during sleep with aging (Table 14–1). Although some of the observed changes can be attributed to normal aging itself (eg, age-related alterations in circadian rhythms), most are due to comorbid medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and primary sleep disorders.",

      "title": "The Renin–Angiotensin System Modulates Dopaminergic Neurotransmission: A New Player on the Scene",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an extrapyramidal disorder characterized by neuronal degeneration in several regions of the peripheral and central nervous systems. It is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's. It has become a major health problem, affecting 1% of the world population over 60 years old and 3% of people beyond 80 years. The main histological findings are intracellular Lewy bodies composed of misfolded α-synuclein protein aggregates and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system. Neuroinflammation, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered calcium homeostasis, abnormal protein degradation, and synaptic pathobiology have been put forward as mechanisms leading to cell death, α-synuclein deposition, or both. A progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra late in the neurodegeneration leads to developing motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is involved in regulating blood pressure and body fluid balance, also plays other important functions in the brain. The RAS is involved in the autocrine and paracrine regulation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic synapses. Dopamine depletion, as in PD, increases angiotensin II expression, which stimulates or inhibits dopamine synthesis and is released via AT1 or AT2 receptors. Furthermore, angiotensin II AT1 receptors inhibit D1 receptor activation allosterically. Therefore, the RAS may have an important modulating role in the flow of information from the brain cortex to the basal ganglia. High angiotensin II levels might even aggravate neurodegeneration, activating the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex, which leads to increased reactive oxygen species production.",

      "abstract": "Reports of sleep disturbances and delayed sleep timing in attentiondeficit/\r\nhyperactivity-disorder (ADHD) are common however the aetiology of such\r\nfeatures is poorly understood. There is substantial evidence pointing to dysfunction\r\nof the circadian timing system in ADHD, and individual differences in human\r\nchronotype and diurnal preference have been linked with impulsivity and attention\r\nproblems in adults. In the work presented here we examined associations between a\r\nlater circadian phase of entrainment, impaired sleep quality, and circadian\r\nmisalignment and how they relate to core symptoms of ADHD distributed among\r\nthe general population. We report novel evidence which suggests that ‘social jetlag’ –\r\nan index of circadian misalignment arising from discordance between endogenous\r\ncircadian timing and the timing of the social clock – is a consistent predictor of\r\npoorer ADHD-like symptom outcomes. Furthermore, objective assessment of the\r\nrest-activity rhythm and sleep intervals of subjects show that a failure to precisely\r\nentrain to the 24 h circadian period is associated with ADHD-like symptom severity\r\nwhich was in turn predicted by delayed circadian phase/sleep phase, sleep quality,\r\nand duration. Candidate gene approaches did not replicate previous findings linking\r\nsymptoms of impulsivity, inattention, and later chronotype with elements of the core\r\nmolecular clock. However, we did find differential susceptibility to the previously\r\nidentified risk factors; poor sleep quality and social jetlag which were both modified\r\nby genotype. Preliminary data from an exploratory study examining the\r\nneurophysiological correlates of response inhibition and selective attention revealed\r\ninteresting patters of ERP elicitation in individuals with high levels of social jetlag.\r\nThe current findings highlight how examination of sleep and circadian rhythm\r\ndisturbances associated with ADHD may inform our understanding of the disorder\r\nrisk and might in the future be factored into interventions designed for better\r\nsymptom management.",

      "abstract": "The main clinical distinction between hypochondria and psychosomatic states is that in the former a flooding and intense anxiety regarding the body is frequently present, while in the latter, such anxiety is usually absent. Since the hypochondriac's flooding, but unsymbolized, anxiety is so prevalent, hypochondria has been historically classified as one of the types of actual neurosis, a term used by Freud to include intense physical and emotional states. The intricate relation between hypochondriac anxiety and excessive daydreaming has important implications for our clinical work. Even in otherwise relatively well functioning personalities, the hypochondriac involvement with the body might become so extensive that, at its extremity. It can induce autistic-like withdrawals into a world of hypertrophied attention to one's sensations, where daydreaming disease and deterioration and the ensuing flooding anxiety become densely intermingled, creating a very painful and detached existence.",

      "title": "The biological basis of injury and neuroprotection in the fetal and neonatal brain",
      "abstract": "Abstract A compromised intrauterine environment that delivers low levels of oxygen and/or nutrients, or is infected or inflammatory, can result in fetal brain injury, abnormal brain development and in cases of chronic compromise, intrauterine growth restriction. Preterm birth can also be associated with injury to the developing brain and affect the normal trajectory of brain growth. This review will focus on the effects that episodes of perinatal hypoxia (acute, chronic, associated with inflammation or as an antecedent of preterm birth) can have on the developing brain. In animal models of these conditions we have found that relatively brief (acute) periods of fetal hypoxemia can have significant effects on the fetal brain, for example death of susceptible neuronal populations (cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex) and cerebral white matter damage. Chronic placental insufficiency which includes fetal hypoxemia, nutrient restriction and altered endocrine status can result in fetal growth restriction and long‐term deficits in neural connectivity in addition to altered postnatal function, for example in the auditory and visual systems. Maternal/fetal inflammation can result in fetal brain damage, particularly but not exclusively in the white matter; injury is more pronounced when associated with fetal hypoxemia. In the baboon, in which the normal trajectory of growth is affected by preterm birth, there is a direct correlation between a higher flux in oxygen saturation and a greater extent of neuropathological damage. Currently, the only established therapy for neonatal encephalopathy in full term neonates is moderate hypothermia although this only offers some protection to moderately but not severely affected brains. There is no accepted therapy for injured preterm brains. Consequently the search for more efficacious treatments continues; we discuss neuroprotective agents (erythropoietin, N‐acetyl cysteine, melatonin, creatine, neurosteroids) which we have trialed in appropriate animal models. The possibility of combining hypothermia with such agents or growth factors is now being considered. A deeper understanding of causal pathways in brain injury is essential for the development of efficacious strategies for neuroprotection.",

      "title": "Diagnostic Tools for Insomnia",
      "abstract": "In a general sense, insomnia suggests inadequate sleep quality or quantity when one has an adequate opportunity to sleep. When defined as a sleep disorder, insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep, which may represent problems with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening despite attempts to be sleeping. Sleep disorder nosologies also may include a complaint of nonrefreshing sleep as an insomnia complaint. For a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder to be made, daytime consequences or functional impairment also should be present. These may include fatigue, inability to concentrate, or irritability. Insomnia may be characterized as primary or comorbid (1). Primary insomnia occurs independently while comorbid insomnia presumably is associated with a sleep disturbance related to another disorder. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the general population at least occasionally and is a severe or chronic problem for about 10% of the population. Patients with co-occurring conditions have significantly increased risk for insomnia (2). People suffering with insomnia have increased healthcare costs and utilize health resources to a greater extent. They also have worse scores on quality-of-life measures. Persistent insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for the development or exacerbation of certain psychiatric and medical conditions. Overall, insomnia represents a significant socioeconomic burden both for individuals and for society. This chapter will provide an overview of current perspectives on the causes, consequences, and associations of insomnia.ETIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND PATHOGENESIS",

      "abstract": "Abstract Social jetlag (SJ) occurs when sleep-timing irregularities from social or occupational demands conflict with endogenous sleep–wake rhythms. SJ is associated with evening chronotype and poor mental health, but mechanisms supporting this link remain unknown. Impaired ability to retrieve extinction memory is an emotion regulatory deficit observed in some psychiatric illnesses. Thus, SJ-dependent extinction memory deficits may provide a mechanism for poor mental health. To test this, healthy male college students completed 7–9 nights of actigraphy, sleep questionnaires, and a fear conditioning and extinction protocol. As expected, greater SJ, but not total sleep time discrepancy, was associated with poorer extinction memory. Unexpectedly, greater SJ was associated with a tendency toward morning rather than evening chronotype. These findings suggest that deficient extinction memory represents a potential mechanism linking SJ to psychopathology and that SJ is particularly problematic for college students with a greater tendency toward a morning chronotype.",

      "abstract": "Functional somatic syndromes are increasingly diagnosed in chronically ill patients presenting with an array of symptoms not attributed to physical ailments. Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome are common disorders that belong in this broad category. Such syndromes are characterised by the presence of one or multiple chronic symptoms including widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and abdominal pain, amongst other issues. Symptoms are believed to relate to a complex interaction of biological and psychosocial factors, where a definite aetiology has not been established. Theories suggest causative pathways between the immune and nervous systems of affected individuals with several risk factors identified in patients presenting with one or more functional syndromes. Risk factors including stress and childhood trauma are now recognised as important contributors to chronic pain conditions. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse during childhood is considered a severe stressor having a high prevalence in functional somatic syndrome suffers. Such trauma permanently alters the biological stress response of the suffers leading to neuroexcitatory and other nerve issues associated with chronic pain in adults. Traumatic and chronic stress results in epigenetic changes in stress response genes, which ultimately leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system manifesting in a broad array of symptoms. Importantly, these systems are known to be dysregulated in patients suffering from functional somatic syndrome. Functional somatic syndromes are also highly prevalent co-morbidities of psychiatric conditions, mood disorders, and anxiety. Consequently, this review aims to provide insight into the role of the nervous system and immune system in chronic pain disorders associated with the musculoskeletal system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.",

      "title": "A rare yet treatable case of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Dear Sir, Paroxysmal dyskinesias are movement disorders that manifest with recurrent abnormal involuntary movements that are episodic. The movements can be chorea, athetosis, ballism, dystonia, or a combination of all.[1] Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is the most common type of movement disorder, and it can be primary or secondary to some illnesses and is precipitated by sudden voluntary actions.[2] The secondary causes implicated are trauma; stroke; neurosyphilis; encephalitis; multiple sclerosis; and metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, hypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and kernicterus.[3] Here, we describe a case of secondary PKD. A 32-year-old man with normal birth and developmental milestones presented with multiple episodes of dystonic posturing in the left upper and lower limbs precipitated by walking or activity for 10 years. The frequency of the episodes was 4–5 per day. There was no preceding aura, sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, tongue bite, or urinary incontinence in any of the episodes. In addition, the patient denied any premonitory urge before the attacks, and they were not suppressible. Each episode lasted 25–40 seconds and used to occur soon after patient started walking and would subside spontaneously. There was no history of gait imbalance, cognitive impairment, or cranial nerve involvement. His family history was negative for similar complaints. He was treated with multiple antiseizure medications in the past with no relief in symptoms. On examination, the mini-mental state examination score was 30/30. His general physical examination was normal. His speech, cranial nerves, power, reflexes, and sensory and cerebellar examination were normal, and he was noted to have positive Trousseau sign. He underwent video electroencephalography recording with the possibility of seizures versus movement disorder. No epileptiform discharges were detected in both ictal and interictal electroencephalography. Routine investigations, including hemogram and renal and liver function tests, were within normal limits. The corrected serum calcium level was 5.1 mg/dL (8.6–10.2 mg/dL) and phosphorus level was 5.3 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL). Serum ionized calcium measured during the dystonic attack was 0.8 mmol/L (1.16–1.3 mmol/L). Serum ceruloplasmin, peripheral blood film for acanthocytes, and thyroid function were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram revealed prolonged QTc interval. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) head revealed calcifications in the bilateral caudate, putamen, thalami [Figure 1], and cerebellum. Subsequently, the intact parathyroid hormone level was 1.56 pg/mL (normal, 15–65 pg/mL) and vitamin D level was 40 ng/mL (11–42 ng/mL). He was managed with acetazolamide and high-dose calcium supplementation, following which the attacks remarkably diminished in duration and frequency at his 1-month follow up.Figure 1:: Non-contrast computed tomography head showing calcification of the bilateral basal ganglia structures and thalamiThis case is noteworthy as it remained a diagnostic dilemma for approximately 10 years. Simple investigations such as serum calcium and NCCT head clinched the diagnosis. A multitude of clinical features are reported in hypoparathyroidism such as seizures, tetany, depression, psychosis, and extrapyramidal manifestations.[4,5] However, case reports of hypoparathyroidism presenting as PKD are scarce.[6-9] The involuntary movements are due to low serum calcium levels; hypocalcemia renders the neuronal membrane hyperexcitable and leads to paroxysmal dyskinesia, but why the symptoms are paroxysmal is enigmatic. The symptoms usually respond to high-dose calcium supplementation. In addition, the dystonic movements can occur in the setting of normal serum calcium levels when there are extensive calcium deposits in the basal ganglia. Perfusion abnormalities have been noted in the basal ganglia of patients with PKD. The cause of hypoparathyroidism in this patient is highly likely to be idiopathic; we did not perform any genetic testing due to financial constraints. In conclusion, we report an uncommon but easily treatable secondary cause of PKD. Investigations such as serum calcium and NCCT head helped in the diagnosis, and the patient responded well to treatment.

Sleep disorder is also a risk factor for prolonged, persistent post-concussive symptoms. Individuals who have a sleep disorder following concussion are more susceptible to developing prolonged post-concussive symptoms unless the sleep disorder is properly managed. Sleep disorders are divided into primary sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, and secondary sleep disorders that may result from other conditions such as pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. The particular type of sleep disorder must be diagnosed, and will guide both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies, as warranted.",

In fact, adolescent sleep problems commonly co-occur with depression and anxiety, and likely share complex bidirectional relationships over time. Evidence indicates that sleep problems, particularly insomnia, often precede the emergence of the onset of depression in adolescents, and may mediate the sequential comorbidity between anxiety and depression. An important future direction is to explore sleep improvement interventions tailored to the unique developmental needs of adolescents, which may represent a novel approach to prevent adolescent onset mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Up to 50–65% of patients with cirrhosis exhibit interrupted night sleep, delayed sleep habits and excessive daytime sleepiness. These have been variously attributed to disease complications (i.e. ascites, pruritus), hepatic encephalopathy or impaired hepatic melatonin metabolism, but the understanding of their pathophysiology remains limited and their treatment problematic. In addition, use of common hypnotics is contraindicated in these patients because of impaired hepatic disposition and increased cerebral sensitivity to psychoactive medication. Sleep is regulated by the interaction of a homeostatic and a circadian process. The homeostatic process determines sleep propensity in relation to sleep history, so that the need to sleep increases in parallel with the duration of the wake period. The circadian process, which is marked by the 24-h rhythm of the hormone melatonin, is responsible for the alternation of high/low sleep propensity in relation to dark/light cues. Circadian sleep regulation has been studied in some depth in patients with cirrhosis, who show considerable delays in the 24-h melatonin rhythm, mostly in relation to impaired sensitivity to light cues. However, while circadian abnormalities are associated with delayed sleep habits, they do not offer a comprehensive explanation to the sleep–wake changes exhibited by these patients. Limited data are available on homeostatic sleep control in patients with cirrhosis, which is worthy of further study.",

In this study, caregivers of 60 patients with probable/possible AD were asked to indicate the typical temporal pattern of occurrence of any of seven disruptive behaviors over the 24-hour day. Patterns of disruptive behavior were defined as sundowning (afternoon, evening, or nocturnal exacerbation), morning exacerbation, and as a nontemporally specific pattern of behavioral disruption. About 28 % of the patients were reported to sundown whereas 20% showed a pattern of morning exacerbation. Sundowning was unrelated to total score on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), however, sundowning was related to a faster rate of decline over time in selected mental functions on the MMSE. Specifically, declines in ideo-kinetic praxis abilities were related to sundowning.",

      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

According to this concept, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is functionally deficient in depression and increases feelings of helplessness and hopelessness instead of restoring mood and search activity. Thus, REM sleep deprivation, either selective or not, is beneficial by breaking a vicious circle: depression in wakefulness…giving up (helplessness) in dream scenario…increased depression in the subsequent wakefulness. In addition, sleep deprivation is an important challenge for the depressed patient. The ability to confront this challenge and maintain wakefulness has a positive outcome on depression, especially when wakefulness is accompanied by active behavior.",

Le traumatisme craniocerebral (TCC) implique un coup plus ou moins violent a la tete et il peut se produire a divers moments et dans divers lieux : accident de la route ou au travail ou encore lors d'une activite de loisir ou d'une activite sportive. Il y a trois niveaux : le TCC leger, modere et grave. Les deux dernieres categories (TCC modere et grave) impliquent un coma plus ou moins long et le reveil est souvent compare a une deuxieme naissance ou l'on doit tout reapprendre. Souvent, le TCC est caracterise par des sequelles persistantes qui ont la particularite d'etre invisibles. Ainsi, les proches et les ami(e)s et aussi les autres personnes rencontrees peuvent avoir de la difficulte a saisir les changements causes par le TCC ; ceci peut laisser place a de la stigmatisation. Nous avons fait des entretiens semi-diriges avec des personnes ayant survecu a un TCC modere ou grave pour pouvoir les questionner sur leur experience de vie a leur retour a la vie « normale ». Le handicap est le theme central de notre recherche, et a l'aide du modele du Processus de production du handicap (PPH) propose par Fougeyrollas et al. (1998), nous avons observe l'importance du role des facteurs personnels (sequelles) et surtout de l'impact des facteurs environnementaux (famille, ami(e)s, organismes et institutions, etc.) sur la reduction ou l'augmentation des habitudes de vie (situation de handicap). Pour faire la demonstration que la personne ayant survecu a un TCC n'est pas un acteur passif face a sa situation de handicap, nous avons utilise le concept « d'agir » propose par Hurtubise et Roy (2007). Cela a permis d'illustrer les diverses strategies qu'utilise une personne vivant avec un TCC pour faire face aux differents obstacles. Nous avons identifie cinq types d'actions : l'evitement, la paralysie, la contrainte, le bricolage et la tactique. Toutes les personnes de notre recherche n'ont pas fait un retour a leur vie d'avant l'accident mais ils ont tous trouve de nouvelles habitudes de vie adaptees a leur situation ; plusieurs doivent et devront faire face a des obstacles en lien avec le TCC.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : traumatisme crânien, handicap invisible, liminalite, agir, stigmatisation",

The problem maybe finding it hard to get to sleep, waking up through the night or not being able to return to sleep after waking up. Poor sleep can result in feeling slowed mentally and physically, being less able to enjoy things, feeling irritable or low in mood and people often say that their pain is often harder to cope with during these days.",

The neuroanatomy remains poorly defined but three levels seem likely: a) a cortical level; b) a bulbar, or effector, level; and 3) a synkinetic, or integrative, level probably at or near the hypothalamus. Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions. What brings these together is their clinical similarity and probable disinhibition at higher brainstem levels.",

Socioeconomic factors are important determinants of disability, although this aspect of disability in chronic pain disorders is often ignored. Lower socioeconomic status has been shown to be associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of disability, and the rate of progression to disability in patients with chronic pain. Work disability in lower socioeconomic groups is associated with issues of physical work demands and work flexibility (ie, the ability to control the pace of work, take unscheduled breaks or engage in modified work). Workplace interventions, particularly in the subacute phase, that are geared to workers′ limitations offer the best opportunity to reduce the current burden of disability. Where such work modifications are not available, disability will be problematic.",

      "abstract": "Overloading of the functional - competent structures sets in motion psychohormonal stress mechanisms, which result not only in an increased proportion of catecholamine in the blood stream, but also in the region of the limbus system, which approaches a key position as a stress stimulator for emotional excitation and transmission. In this situation individually programmed learning as well as personality structure plays a decisive role for stress sensitivity and handling. Dangerous situations arising in traffic lead firstly therefore to a psycho-reactive abnormal behaviour, when a person is affected who is already suffering from a chronic stress condition. At the centre of the problem is a disturbance on an affective basis, which on the one hand leads to a reaction of a different kind regarding the environment, and on the other hand supplies the basis for vegetative decompensation. These functional disturbances do not lead to alterations in the heart-blood circulation system, but they are the bases for primitive reactions and/or sudden irrational actions. /TRRL/",

Patients with EDS have often been misdiagnosed with depression due to their complaints of lack of energy and poor concentration. Also, they have even been diagnosed erroneously with a psychotic disorder in case of coexistence with hypnagogic hallucination. EDS can seriously affect the person's quality of life by causing decreased academic achievement or work performance, low self esteem, and social withdrawal. EDS is also frequently associated with various medical and psychiatric conditions, and often fatal traffic or on-the-job accidents. The causes of EDS range from insufficient sleep to central nervous system-originated hypersomnia. The conditions that can lead to EDS include circadian rhythm disorders, primary disorders of alertness such as narcolepsy, sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, sleep-related movement disorders such as periodic limb movement disorder and restless legs syndrome, chronic medical conditions such as cancer, and medications causing sleepiness. Treatment options should be tailored according to the underlying condition and include sufficient sleep time, light therapy, sleep scheduling, wakefulness-promoting medications, or mechanical airway managements such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).",

Circadian (~24 h) rhythms indicate the rhythmic change of different physiological activities in relation to the environmental light-dark cycle. Shift work, light exposure at night, and chronic and acute jet lag affect circadian rhythm that have a negative impact on psychological functions, and behaviors. Additionally, professional stress, mental instability, and social disintegration influence psychiatric disorders. PubMed/MEDLINE, Springer Nature, Science Direct (Elsevier), Wiley Online, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar databases were searched to collect relevant articles. Circadian rhythm disruption causes impaired neurotransmitter release, impaired melatonin and cortisol rhythm, metabolic dysfunctions, neuroinflammation, and neural apoptosis; collectively these factors influence the development of psychiatric disorders. Circadian dysfunction also alters the expression of several clock control genes in the mesolimbic areas that are associated with pathologies of psychiatric disorders. Additionally, chronotherapy and applications of anti-psychotic medicine can improve psychiatric diseases. This review focuses on the effects of circadian clock dysfunction on the vulnerability of psychiatric disorders and the implications of chronotherapy.",

Frequently, no specific primary cause is found, although any disease or condition that increases the contents in the carpal canal may result in compression of the nerve against the transverse carpal ligament. Thus, tenosynovitis or edema of the tenosynovium from any cause, may produce secondary compression of the nerve. The symptom complex resulting from this compression, commonly known as the carpal tunnel syndrome, consists of unilateral or bilateral episodic paresthesias, involving part or all of the distribution of the median nerve in the hand. These are intensified several hours after retirement, and nocturnal pain is a feature. The pain may awaken the patient from sleep, and often is relieved by shaking the extremity or maintaining it in a dependent position. Symptoms decrease with morning activities, although they may be aggravated by overexertion.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders have reached epidemic rates in the modern world. It is important to note that they can affect children as well as adults. Sleep is of the utmost importance for the maintenance of body homeostasis. Many disease processes affecting sleep have been associated with numerous symptoms, including cognitive impairment, fatigue as well as a wide range of behavioral, hormonal and metabolic derangements. Sleep disorders in childhood can be classified by age of incidence (in infants, toddlers, school-age children or adolescents) and by the exact nature of the symptoms. They are classified in insomnias, hypersomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm disorders and respiratory disorders which affect sleep. Parasomnias are the most common sleep disorders in toddlers, with night terrors, nightmares and sleepwalking being the most common. Respiratory disorders are the most important in older children, especially obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. All sleep disorders are clinically manifested with symptoms of sleep deprivation. Their management always involves improvement of sleep hygiene, though in some cases (such as obstructive sleep apnea) specific medical treatment is also available and warranted. A three-way relationship of trust, compassion and cooperation between child, family and healthcare professional is a prerequisite for the effective management of childhood sleep disorders. Nursing staff are the main factor cultivating that relationship in the context of inpatient care.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "title": "Systems Biology of Oscillatory Processes in Sleep and Mental Disorders",
      "abstract": "From a biological point of view, mental disorders can be characterized as disturbances of complex oscillatory processes manifesting themselves on different organizational levels of the brain. One clinical example is the cyclic nature of bipolar disorders, sometimes with ultrarapid fluctuations. Regarding neurophysiology and brain electric activity, another example are certain EEG patterns indicating different modes of synchronization of neural activity. In this respect, reduced gamma activity has been found in prefrontal areas in schizophrenia. Since sleep disorders appear to be inherent in virtually all mental disorders, they are of particular interest and in the focus of studies of oscillatory processes. Onset, depth, duration, frequency, and duration of different sleep phases etc. are significantly altered in depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, delirium tremens, and a wide spectrum of other disorders. Cortisol profiles and other biological parameters contribute to irregular temporal patterns in case of mental illnesses. Several replicated findings indicate that circadian and infradian rhythms of neurotransmitters as well as the endocrine system play a crucial role in this respect. A dynamic imbalance between norepinephrinergic, cholinergic and serotonergic transmission perturbs neuronal signaling, but it is unclear which of the components predominates. Reduced reactivity of feedback loops, slow on- or offset of activity of different neurotransmitter components are candidate to evoke dysfunctions in more global, higher circuits and connections, which may cause the complex symptomatology of depressive and manic states.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) could be defined as an insult to the brain caused by an external force producing altered states of consciousness that result in impaired cognitive or physical functions. TBI, especially if severe, can produce structural and functional modifications of the brain, which in turn can result in a highly variable and complex interaction of symptoms depending on the motor, sensory, cognitive, emotional, behavioural, and autonomic spheres. The brain during traumatic collision is prone to insults due to a complex combination of acceleration and deceleration and translation and rotation forces causing contusions, diffuse axonal injuries (DAI), and haemorrhages. Moreover, damages to neurons may occur as a consequence of biochemical modifications as a consequence of a drop in the levels of oxygen and glucose, and, finally, because of blood hypotension or increased intracranial pressure. This complex combination of and interaction among insults tends to produce a heterogeneous association of diffused and focalized damages that affect every possible area of the brain: cortical, subcortical, and midbrain. In addition, mild TBI can produce cerebral damage whose severity is directly correlated with the length of loss of consciousness and of post-traumatic amnesia",

The rising prevalence of depression underscores the need to investigate its relationship with circadian rhythm, which could enhance current treatment approaches, such as light therapy and melatonin supplementation. Many individuals with depression experience insomnia, delayed sleep phase, and fragmented sleep, which is related to circadian dysfunction. Circadian rhythm is typically controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other external clues, such as light or meal timing. An impact on genetic bases or external factors could disrupt circadian rhythm. Epidemiological, clinical, and animal studies have revealed the bidirectional relationship between circadian disruption and depression with supporting evidence. This essay focuses on the bidirectional relationship between depression and circadian rhythm. Furthermore, this essay will discuss how clock genes, neurotransmitters, the HPA axis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction induce depression and circadian disruption.",

An outsized and mounting body of discovery shed light on the fact that internal health is interrelated to risk factors for heart complaint before an opinion of an internal health complaint and through treatment. These things can arise both directly, through natural pathways, and laterally, through parlous health actions. People who are passing through clinical depression, anxiety disorders, common and general stress syndromes, and indeed post-traumatic stress disorder commonly known as PTSD over an absolute period of your occasion may observe definite physiological alterations in the body, similarly, as a highly enlarged cardiac reactivity such as augmented vital signs and elevated blood pressure, deducted or condensed blood inflow directly to the center, and heightened or highly raised amount of an organic chemical compound called cortisol. Over time, these physiologic processes may generate calcium particle depositions or buildup within the normal organic pathways. It may also manifest events of body metabolic dysfunction as well as cardiac conduction problems. Substantiation shows that many physiological and psychiatric/psychological diseases -similar to chronic clinical depression, psychological stress, and PTSD can appear after any cardiac event regardless of its severity. Objective: The focal objective of this article is to identify psychological stress, its influence on cardiac problems such as cardiac arrhythmia, and its symptomatic manifestations on an electrocardiogram. Apart from that, this paper also focuses on the area of how ECG changes due to psychological distress. Another objective of this paper is to provide vivid information about psychological stress and its link with acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Laymen should know the fact that the mind and the body are linked with each other and if the mind is distressed for a long time will affect the health condition of the physical body also. Design/Methodology/Approach: To build the paper, mostly secondary information has been used from various sources such as clinical literature, journals, websites, etc. Primary information has also been used to increase the accuracy and reliability of the paper. Primary data have been taken from neuropsychologists, cardiologists, clinical psychopathologists, and behavioral medicine specialists. Based on all these databases, systematic and scientific clinical analysis of information has been done to avoid any mistakes and errors. Findings/Result: In people with ICDs, stress and physical exercise might cause ventricular rhythm abnormalities. Future studies into medicines that prevent these stimuli' responses might reduce ventricular arrhythmias and upsets in some of these patients. People with type A personalities should try to control or adjust their innate personality and character to reduce the vulnerability to develop any kind of cardiac arrhythmia or any other cardiac pathologies. All ECG variations and arrhythmias are not related to psychological stress rather it needs differential diagnosis to rule out any other underlying problems. A thorough differential investigation is suggested to rule out whether the cardiac problem is due to psychological stress or not. Originality and value: A comprehensive analysis and interpretation have been made to cover the concerned topic of study and make information more reliable and valid. A new initiative is taken to provide information about the mind and heart link. Paper Type: Secondary clinical report analysis/interpretive paper",

Epilepsy is defined as at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart or one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years [5]. The most important diagnostic tool is the history. The examination is very often normal unless the patient has a structural brain lesion. The history should include the following information:• The presence or absence of an aura, which is a recurrent stereotypic abnormal sensation or experience. The aura is a simple partial seizure or focal seizure without impairment of consciousness or awareness according to the newly proposed classification of seizures and epilepsies [6].",

Stress is either short term or long term. short term stress may lasts for few hours but long term lasts for few months. long term stress causes many health problems like respiratory infections, lack of sleep, poor diet etc. Many hormones involve in the stress response like cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, gonadotropins. Immune system also affected with stress. Stress weakened the immune system. Stress causes an increase in the white blood cells (WBC) in the blood. This review discusses the effect of stress on hormones and on immune system. Chronic or long-term stress can suppress the pathological and protective immune responses While short-term stress can increase the expression of pathological and protective immune responses.",

      "abstract": "Rhythmical changes in terrain susceptibility and trigger occurrence can induce periodic temporal patterns in headache patients, with readily foreseeable frequency cycles of attacks. The impaired ability of biological functions to adjust to cyclic environmental changes represents the minus, the handicap, the increased risk of clinical symptomatology (headache); attacks occur when the precarious systems of these patients are forced by cyclical environmental stimuli towards phase shiftings or to cope with new levels of performance. A dyschronic hypothesis of primary headache must be based upon observations demonstrating that along with dysfunctions of the pain control systems there is also a vulnerability of the rhythmic physiological organization of CNS. On sait que les fluctuations de la “susceptibilité du terrain” et la succession rythmique d'évènements trigger différents sont à même de conditionner des profils céphalalgiques périodiques, tout à fait prévisibles dans leur caractère séquentiel. La perte de la capacité des fonctions biologiques de s'adapter aux oscillations ambiantes de nature cyclique représente le “minus”, le “handicap”, le risque accru d'une véritable symptomatologie (céphalée); les crises se manifestent au moment où les stimuli ambients périodiques contraignent les systèmes neuronals précaires de ces patients à un glissement de phase ou à faire face à de nouveaux niveaux critiques d'activité. Une hypothèse dyschronique des céphalées primaires doit se fonder sur des observations démontrant qu'il existe aussi, dans ces patients, à côté du trouble des systèmes préposés au contrôle et à la perception des stimuli nociceptifs, une vulnérabilité de l'organisation physiologique rythmique du SNC. E’ di rilievo comune come fluttuazioni della “suscettibilità di terreno” ed il succedersi ritmico di vari eventi trigger siano in grado di condizionare profili cefalalgici periodici, ampiamente prevedibili nella loro sequenzialità. La perdita della capacità delle funzioni biologiche di adattarsi alle oscillazioni ambientali di natura ciclica costituisce il “minus”, l’ “handicap”, l'aumentato rischio di sintomatologia vera e propria (cefalea); le crisi si manifestano nel momento in cui stimoli ambientali periodici sollecitano i precari sistemi neuronali di questi pazienti a slittare di fase o far fronte a nuovi livelli critici di attività. Un'ipotesi discronica delle cefalee primarie deve fondarsi su osservazioni che dimostrino come in questi pazienti, a lato della disfunzione dei sistemi preposti al controllo ed alla percezione degli stimoli nocicettivi, una vulnerabilità anche esista della fisiologica organizazione ritmica del SNC.",

The clinical spectrum of parasomnias encompasses abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming and autonomic nervous system activation. Parasomnia behaviors are to be considered as automatisms, motor acts unconscious and uncontrolled by volition. Parasomnias disrupt sleep and may have adverse health and psychosocial effects. Pathophysiologically these sleep disorders may be explained as dissociations between the three primary states of wakefulness, NREM sleep and REM sleep. In the ICSD-2 many categories of parasomnias are reported. We will describe the main parasomnias arising from NREM as well as REM sleep.",

      "title": "Depression: some proposals for future research.",
      "abstract": "The argument has been advanced that pathological states of anxiety and mania are both characterized by a failure on the part of the patient to attach appropriate levels of significance to changes occurring in the immediate environment. There is, it is suggested, a tendency for environmental features to be regarded as important even though, viewed objectively, they may have little relevance to the patient and his needs. Depression, it is further proposed, may be viewed as an extreme defense reaction to the intense anxiety which results from attaching too much significance to environmental events. In depressive state, patients are often characterised by their lowered responsiveness to stimulation and their lack of interest in, or concern about, their surroundings: it may be that, in such state, information processing has been blocked or reduced. The daytime drowsiness of the depressed patients, as well as his night-time sleep disturbance and the frequently observed recurrent or cyclic nature of certain kinds of depressed state, suggest that this blocking of sensory processing may be brought about by the involuntary intervention of mechanisms responsible, under normal circumstances, for sleep induction. This view of the nature of depression has been recast into the form of five potentially testable hypotheses. Speculation is always easy; providing convincing demonstrations that those speculations are reasonable is less easy. It is in the nature of psychological investigation that laboratory-based studies distort and may even destroy the phenomena about which information is sought, and many a perfectly reasonable theory has foundered upon the rocks of translation into experimental terms. In those areas of psychology which have implications for psychiatry and the conceptualisation of psychopathological states, this danger is particularly evident: psychiatric syndromes are complex, variable, and have social referrents, but laboratory experiments are limited in their capacity to reflect all these attributes, and consequently they may never provide really adequate tests of a theory about a psychiatric state. We have to try to come to terms with this apparent impasse--in the first place by being circumspect in translating psychiatric concepts into experimental terms, and secondly by exercising caution in interpreting the results to which the experiments give rise. More importantly, however, we have to accept the essential inadequacy of the majority of experimental paradigms in psychiatric research and to regard theorizing--even when it is not linked to explicitly testable hypotheses--as having inherent value.",

Een grote groep mensen krijgt regelmatig niet genoeg slaap vanwege bijvoorbeeld werkdruk, stress, of slaapstoornissen. Omdat slaap een belangrijke rol speelt bij herstel, onderhoud en plasticiteit van zenuwcellen kan onvoldoende slaap ernstige gevolgen hebben voor het functioneren van de hersenen en voor de gezondheid in zijn algemeenheid. Talloze studies hebben aangetoond dat slecht of weinig slapen geassocieerd is met een verhoogd risico op allerlei ziektes, met name ook psychiatrische aandoeningen. Vooral de associatie tussen verstoorde slaap en depressie is erg sterk. Alhoewel verstoorde slaap nog vaak gezien wordt als een symptoom en gevolg van depressie zijn er steeds meer aanwijzingen dat verstoorde slaap bij veel patienten juist een causale factor zou kunnen zijn die bijdraagt aan het ontstaan en in stand houden van depressie en bovendien de efficientie van behandelingen verminderd. Ook laten gecontroleerde experimenten met proefdieren zien dat chronisch verstoorde slaap geleidelijk aan kan leiden tot veranderingen in het brein zoals die ook voorkomen bij depressieve patienten. Dit artikel geeft een overzicht van verschillende studies aan mensen en proefdieren die suggereren dat verstoorde slaap kan bijdragen aan depressie en bespreekt mogelijke onderliggende neurobiologische mechanismes.",

      "abstract": "Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord that may result in the loss of mobility. Frequent causes of damage are trauma (motor vehicle accident, falls, etc.) or disease (polio, spina bifida, Friedreich's Ataxia, etc.). However, abnormality in circadian rhythm has been observed in SCI. Melatonin is the primary hormone of the pineal gland and acts to regulate the body's circadian rhythm. Normally, melatonin levels begin to rise in the mid-to-late evening, remains high for most of the night, and then decreases in the early morning hours. Patients with SCI have a lower melatonin secretion during the hours of darkness than in healthy subjects. This may contribute to impaired sleep at night, fatigue during the day and affect pain perception. Disturbed level of melatonin has also been reported in SCI patients that are associated with disturbances in circadian rhythm. Therefore, circadian rhythm can be important in the pathophysiology and treatment of SCI patients and it is important to know the time and the level of melatonin in order to prescribe the appropriate treatment regimen. The expanding science of circadian rhythm biology and a growing interest in human clinical research on circadian rhythm in patients with spinal cord injuries inspired this review.

During NREM sleep, arousal-related phasic events tend to aggregate into the ordered sequences of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), which keeps the sleeping brain under control and provides a continuous balance between the programming centers (order) and the contingent psychological, organic and environmental factors (chaos). Due to its functional properties, CAP translates a condition of criticality and undergoes specific alterations in most sleep pathologies. The clinical applications of CAP are explored in sleep apnea syndrome, insomnia, narcolepsy, epilepsy, NREM and REM sleep parasomnias, as well as the involvement of CAP in cognitive processes and in critical care settings. During NREM sleep, the locus coeruleus (LC) exhibits infra-slow oscillatory activity with a periodicity that partially overlaps with that of CAP, suggesting a functional interaction between LC-driven noradrenergic rhythms and CAP dynamics. Through the structured collection of phasic events, CAP regulates sleep continuity, modulates responsiveness to internal and external stimuli and plays a coordinated activity in NREM sleep oscillations.",

      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia) is one of the clinically important, but inadequately studied symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). It manifests as constant excessive sleepiness during the day and/or short unexpected (unintentional) naps. Hypersomnia negatively affects quality of life in patients; it is potentially dangerous in the situations requiring greater attention. The paper presents current approaches to diagnosing hypersomnia in PD. It discusses the multifactorial nature of its pathophysiology in patients with PD. The present-day ideas about the relationship of hypersomnia to degeneration of the brain structures involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness, to nocturnal sleep disorders and dopaminergic therapy are described. The paper gives the results of experimental and clinical studies confirming the role of circadian mechanisms in the manifestation of insomnia and hypersomnia in PD patients. It describes a clinical case of a patient with moderate motor and cognitive impairments, in whom hypersomnia is a leading factor in deteriorating daily life. The possible role of circadian disturbances in the development of hypersomnia and related mild manifestations of insomnia and parasomnia is discussed. A clinically significant effect in treating sleep and wakefulness disorders has been achieved in the prolonged use of melatonin and cognitive-behavioral therapy.",

      "title": "BRUXISMO DO SONO",
      "abstract": "Introducao: O bruxismo do sono e caracterizado pelo ranger ou apertar dos dentes durante o sono e que, geralmente, esta associada com despertares curtos com duracao de 3 a 15 segundos, conhecidos como microdespertares e se diferencia do bruxismo diurno por envolver: distintos estados de consciencia, isto e, sono e vigilia; e diferentes estados fisiologicos com diferentes influencias na excitabilidade oral motora. O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

Sleep influences the expression of epileptic seizures and the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges, typically during nonrapid eye movement sleep. Conversely, epilepsy and its treatment alter sleep regulation, provoke sleep disruption, and affect daytime alertness, and may contribute to, or improve sleep disorders. Effective treatment of a coexisting sleep disorder may improve seizure control, daytime alertness, and health-related quality of life. Understanding the relationship between sleep and epilepsy may lead to improved knowledge for optimizing management of the epilepsy patient.",

Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

      "title": "[Hypothyroidism--clinical findings, diagnosis, therapy. Thyroid tests should be performed on broad indications].",
      "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is a clinical entity resulting from deficiency of thyroid hormones or, more rarely, from their impaired activity at tissue level. It is a common condition, with a prevalence of 1.9 per cent in women, and the prevalence increases with age. Hypothyroidism may be congenital or acquired, primary or secondary, chronic or transient. Primary hypothyroidism is caused by disease or treatment which destroys the thyroid gland or interferes with thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Autoimmune thyroiditis is the predominant cause of primary hypothyroidism in countries such as Sweden where severe iodine deficiency is non-existent. Another cause of primary hypothyroidism, chronic or transient, is previous radio-iodine or surgical treatment of hypothyroidism. In secondary or central hypothyroidism, which is very rare, there is a lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or TSH activity, due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause. The clinical features of hypothyroidism are dependent on the patient's age, the presence of other disease, and the rate at which hypothyroidism develops. As thyroid hormones are universal determinants of organ function, there may be a multiplicity of symptoms. Particularly in the elderly, the clinical features may be atypical, and the diagnosis easily missed. First line tests for hypothyroidism are analyses of the concentrations of free thyroxine (T4) and TSH in serum. In primary hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH high. In central hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH generally low or normal, though slightly increased levels of biologically inactive TSH may also occur. Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterised by a normal serum level of T4, an increased level of TSH, and the absence of clinical symptoms. When a diagnosis of chronic hypothyroidism is confirmed, treatment with laevothyroxine is started, the initial dose being adjusted to the age and general condition of the patient, and the duration and severity of hypothyroidism. As a rule, full thyroxine replacement therapy should bring the serum TSH level into the normal range. In central hypothyroidism, laevothyroxine treatment is similar, but pituitary function must be evaluated and, if necessary, corticosteroid replacement be instituted before laevothyroxine treatment is started.",

Clinicians should also be aware of conditions that commonly occur in conjunction with this illness, including sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, depressive and anxiety disorders, and chronic fatigue. The primary goal of treatment for SWD is to reduce the rate of circadian misalignment by fostering better sleep when it is desired and improved alertness and functioning when appropriate. Nonpharmacologic strategies (eg, melatonin and light therapy) should be tried before considering medications to promote sleep and/or alertness.",

      "abstract": "Vertigo, instability, oscillopsia and concomitant autonomic disorders are classical and well-known symptoms of vestibular disorders. At the same time, recent studies suggest that there are more complicated vestibular dysfunctions caused by the cortical projections of the vestibular system. The central vestibular system includes parietal temporal cortex and insular, anterior intraparietal sulcus, posterior parietal and medial parts of the superior temporal gyrus, singular gyrus retrosplenial cortex, hippocampus and parahippocampal area. The central part of the vestibular system closely interacts with other afferent systems forming a multisensory structure of higher brain functions. Dysfunctions of higher vestibular function play an important role in the development of clinical syndromes including pusher syndrome, room tilt illusion, unilateral spatial neglect syndrome, impairment of spatial memory and navigation. These syndromes can develop due to the direct damage of the cortical vestibular system or as a result of disconnection between the vestibular cortex and other parts of the sensory cortex.Классическими и хорошо известными проявлениями вестибулярных нарушений являются головокружение, неустойчивость, осциллопсия и зачастую сопутствующие им вегетативные расстройства. В то же время исследования последних лет свидетельствуют о существовании более сложных проявлений вестибулярной дисфункции, обусловленных вовлечением корковых проекций вестибулярной системы. Центральное представительство вестибулярной системы включает кору височно-теменной области и островка, передних отделов внутритеменной борозды, задних отделов теменной и медиальных отделов верхней височной извилины, поясной извилины, ретроспленальную кору, гиппокамп и парагиппокампальную область. Центральный отдел вестибулярной системы тесно взаимодействует с другими афферентными системами, формируя мультисенсорную структуру высших мозговых функций. Примерами клинических синдромов, в развитии которых важную роль играет дисфункция высших вестибулярных структур, служат синдром отталкивания, иллюзия наклона пространства, одностороннее пространственное игнорирование и нарушения пространственной памяти и навигации. Эти синдромы могут развиваться вследствие прямого повреждения коркового представительства вестибулярной системы или в результате нарушения взаимодействия между вестибулярной корой и другими отделами сенсорной коры.",

      "abstract": "A epilepsia do lobo temporal mesial (ELTM) e uma condicao cronica caracterizada pela ocorrencia de crises espontâneas e recorrentes (CREs) decorrentes de atividade neuronal excessiva em regioes limbicas do cerebro. Na maioria dos casos, o estabelecimento da epilepsia esta associado a mudancas estruturais e fisiologicas que ocorrem progressivamente no cerebro a partir de um insulto epileptogenico, tal como o Status epilepticus (SE). O periodo de conversao de um cerebro normal em um epileptico – denominado de epileptogenese – e variavel (meses ha anos) e envolve um amplo espectro de processos biologicos, incluindo neurodegeneracao, neurogenese, inflamacao, plasticidade sinaptica, migracao celular dentre outros. Curiosamente, ao final deste periodo, o individuo apresenta crises que, embora imprevisiveis, cursam com um padrao temporal de oscilacao (circadiano e ultradiano). O ritmo de recorrencia e mantido mesmo em condicao de livre curso no escuro, o que tem despertado o interesse do envolvimento do sistema endogeno do relogio na modulacao do limiar de susceptibilidade a crises. Recentemente, observamos que os genes do relogio tem sua expressao modulada pelo processo epileptogenico induzido em modelo experimental, fornecendo evidencias moleculares sobre o efeito da epileptogenese na ritmicidade circadiana. Neste estudo, investigamos a hipotese de que alteracoes no ritmo circadiano interferem no processo epileptogenico e no perfil das crises espontâneas. O modelo experimental utilizado foi o de inducao de SE por meio da injecao de litio-pilocarpina. Ratos Wistar foram exposto ao claroconstante (grupo experimental) ou claro-escuro (grupo controle) durante todo o periodo de experimentacao. Os animais foram video-monitorados de forma continua por um periodo de 55 dias contados a partir da inducao do SE. Avaliamos a frequencia e gravidade das crises epilepticas e a ritmicidade da atividade locomotora espontânea (ALE) antes da inducao do SE e durante a fase cronica da epileptogenese. A gravidade das crises foi avaliada usando a escala de Racine e a ALE foi analisada pelo software Acrophase e El Temps. A proporcao de animais\r\nque desenvolveram crises espontâneas foi maior no grupo mantido em regime de claro constante indicando que a interferencia no ritmo facilitou a epileptogenese. Os animais submetidos a luz constante tiveram o ritmo da atividade locomotora alterado, embora apenas 46% perderam completamente o ritmo ao fim do periodo de experimentacao. Interessantemente, apenas esse subgrupo apresentou uma maior frequencia e gravidade nas crises epilepticas e espontâneas quando comparados com os animais que nao perderam o ritmo provenientes dos grupos claro constante ou claro-escuro. Desse modo, nosso estudo sugere que a exposicao a luz constante pode facilitar a epileptogenese e que o desacoplamento do ritmo da atividade locomotora pode aumentar a gravidade e frequencia das CREs.",

Sleep consists of non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep states. Circadian sleep rhythm is one of the several body rhythms modulated by hypothalamus. Many drugs prescribed for the treatment of depression suppress REM sleep. Sleep deprivation is evaluated in terms of the tasks impaired and the average duration. In the majority of sleep measurements and studies electroencephalography (EEG) has been used in combination with a variety of other physiological parameters. After the EEGs are recorded, to analyze and monitor sleep disorders the main stage is detection of the waveforms corresponding to different stages of sleep. EEG provides important and unique information about the sleeping brain. The polysomnography monitors many body functions including brain, eye movements, muscle activity or skeletal muscle activation and heart rhythm during sleep.",

They may also characterize some frontal or temporal nocturnal seizures of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, or be considered as part of NREM parasomnias, especially sleepwalking, sexsomnia or sleep-related eating disorder, or REM-related behaviors such as REM behavior disorder or complex movements associated with pediatric narcolepsy type I. In most cases rhythmic movements, especially when complex and long in duration, are related to different levels of arousal from sleep with recurrence of ancestral motor sequences promoted by central pattern generators in the brainstem, generally activated by the arousal process. A differential diagnosis between physiological events and pathological movement disorders, and between the latter and sleep-related epilepsy is critical to provide optimal treatment and an accurate prognosis. Specific treatment options for the aforementioned disorders are beyond the scope of this article.",

      "title": "Nocturia. A rarely recognized symptom of sleep apnea and other occult sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "Nocturia, awakening from sleep to urinate, is a common symptom in a variety of medical disorders and in the elderly. Awakening from sleep as a result of nocturia is thought to be secondary to a sensation of urinary urgency resulting from an overextended bladder. Nocturia-related awakenings cause significant sleep disruption and fatigue in elderly patients and are correlated with an increased number of falls at night. Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea are also common in the elderly and are frequently the source of awakenings from sleep. The high incidence of both nocturia and sleep disorders in the elderly and other groups of patients suggests that sleep disorders may be the source of some awakenings from sleep usually attributed by patients to nocturia. Nocturia secondary to sleep disorders would be causatively different from nocturia secondary to pressure to urinate in common medical disorders and would require different diagnostic procedures and treatment.To determine the frequency of nocturia as a symptom of primary sleep disorders.Eighty consecutive patients, 27 women and 53 men with a mean (+/-SD) age of 58.7+/-14.1 years, undergoing polysomnography (sleep study or PSG) for the evaluation of a suspected sleep disorder and who met the sole criteria of awakening from sleep at least once and urinating voluntarily. Each patient had either a standard PSG recording or a PSG with administration of nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Immediately after each episode of nocturia during the PSG, patients were questioned about the reason they believed they had awakened. The PSG record immediately before awakening from sleep was then reviewed for potential causes of awakening. Patients were also asked on final morning awakening to fill in a questionnaire regarding their awakenings during the prior night. Patient reports were compared with the PSG to determine the accuracy of subjective reports.Patients awakened from sleep and voluntarily urinated a mean (+/- of 1.5+/-0.75 times per night for a total of 121 awakenings for the group. The majority (79.3%) of these awakenings from sleep were found to be directly secondary to sleep apnea, snoring or periodic leg movements in sleep. Patients correctly identified the source of their awakening from sleep on only five(4.9%) occasions and only once was sleep apnea correctly cited by a patient as a source of awakening during the night.Most awakenings from sleep attributed by our patients to pressure to urinate were instead a result of sleep disorders, particularly sleep apnea. The fact that patients do urinate once awake likely contributed to faulty post hoc reasoning and might have limited further inquiry by patients and their physicians in clinical settings into the actual sources of awakening from sleep. Even in those patients with well-known medical reasons for noctruria, Sleep disorders were still found to be the source of almost all awakenings from sleep. Patients were extremely poor judges of the reasons they awoke from sleep. The diagnosis of a sleep disorder should be seriously considered whenever a patient reports frequent awakenings from sleep to urinate.",

Here, we describe clinical picture of sleep disorders in AD and the relation between sleep disorders and both cognitive impairment and poor prognosis of the disease. There are difficulties of the diagnosis of sleep disorders based on sleep questionnaires, polysomnography or actigraphy in the AD patients. Typical disturbances of the neurophysiological sleep architecture in the course of the AD include deep sleep and paradoxical sleep deprivation. Among sleep disorders occurring in patients with AD, the most frequent disorders are sleep breathing disorders – mainly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome and restless legs syndrome/periodic legs movements' syndrome. Sleep disorders may influence circadian fluctuations of the concentrations of amyloid-β in the interstitial brain fluid and in the cerebrovascular fluid related to the glymphatic brain system and production of the amyloid-β. There is accumulating evidence suggesting that disordered sleep contributes to cognitive decline and the development of AD pathology. In this mini-review, we highlight and discuss the association between sleep disorders and AD.",

The exploration of the neurobiological basis of dreaming therefore constitutes not only an aspect of mind-body interaction but also a model approach to the study of mental illness. An obvious problem is that the unconfirmable nature of all subjective experience is compounded by difficult access to the mind in sleep.

      "abstract": "Insomnia impairs daytime functioning or causes clinically significant daytime distress. The consequences of insomnia, if left untreated, may contribute to the risks of developing additional serious conditions, such as psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic issues. Furthermore, some comorbidities associated with insomnia may be bidirectional in their causality because psychiatric and other medical problems can increase the risk for insomnia. Regardless of the serious consequences of inadequately treated insomnia, clinicians often do not inquire into their patients' sleep habits, and patients, in turn, are not forthcoming with details of their sleep difficulties. The continuing education of physicians and patients with regard to insomnia and currently available therapies for the treatment of insomnia is, therefore, essential. Insomnia may present as either a difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking too early without being able to return to sleep. Furthermore, these symptoms often change over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, when considering a sleep medication, one with efficacy for the treatment of multiple insomnia symptoms is recommended. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release, has been approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by both difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Here, we review studies supporting the use of zolpidem extended-release in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties.",

Predisposing factors include arousal-prone personality, elevated baseline physiologic arousal, rigid circadian system, and other individual characteristics that make one vulnerable to or set the stage for the development of insomnia. Precipitating factors are the events or conditions that trigger the insomnia. Common examples include life stressors and change of sleep-wake schedule. The perpetuating factors, such conditioning of bedtime cues with arousal, maladaptive sleep-wake habits and worries over sleeplessness, then should become the focus of the treatment. Pharmacologic and non-pharmacological methods of treatment are used in the management of insomnia. In the case of the diagnosis of transient or short-term insomnia, a basic method of treatment is usually administrating the right hypnotics and information on the sleep hygiene. In chronic insomnia, a basic treatment is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which can help pharmacologically by regular use of sedative and hypnotic antidepressant medication in the evening only as needed taking hypnotics drugs (no more than 2-3 times a week).",

The abnormal behavior could be caused by the developmental stage itself, not by the general other reasons. Some of the developmental changes and characteristics in late adulthood are as follows: deterioration of sensory/perceptual and intellectual abilities, changes of personality characteristics, the negative effects of compulsory retirement and loss of social roles, and death of one`s spouse. In addition to those developmental events, learned helplessness and the ineffective functioning of personality system in the aged are discussed. With those of specific changes and events in old age, the psychopathology-especially, depression-is analyzed in detail.",

      "abstract": "The effects of the psilocybin, a psychomimetic substance, on mental junctioning were investigated in normal volunteers as well as in schizophrenics. The disturbances induced constitute a psychoneurotoxic syndrome--\"a state of drunkenness\"--of about four hours duration which develops in three distinct phases. The basic mental symptoms of this syndrome consist of disturbances of the apperception, sensory perception and emotion. A moderate impairment of egofunctioning or reality appraisal and an inability to integrate different mental processes are observed. The psychomotor behavior is mainly harmonized to the prevailing emotional state and to the experiences caused by perceptual alterations, in a lesser degree. These changes, according to our observations, are more severe and more \"psychotic-like\" in schizophrenics rather than in normals. Psychopathological analysis of these changes proves that the whole syndrome cannot be considered as related to the spontaneously triggered functional psychoses or to the organic ones and, therefore, the term \"model-psychosis\" according to our opinion, is unsatisfactory.",

Se asocia a mayor morbilidad cardiovascular, neurocognitiva y metabólica, riesgo de accidentes, mala calidad de vida y mortalidad aumentada. Afecta al 5% de la población adulta y al 2% de niños entre 4 y 5 años. Tiene tratamiento eficaz y rentable, por lo cual es imperativo su diagnóstico y tratamiento. Se caracteriza por episodios repetidos de obstrucción parcial o completa de la faringe durante el sueño, que provocan hipoxia seguida de re-oxigenación y despertares transitorios, responsable de las alteraciones fisiopatológicas y síntomas, que aunque inespecíficos, son muy sugerentes. El paciente tipo de SAHOS, es un hombre obeso, de cuello corto, roncador de larga data, que acusa somnolencia diurna, sueño poco reparador, cansancio, nocturia y leve deterioro cognitivo. Su pareja observa la aparición progresiva de pausas respiratorias. Sin embargo, la presentación es heterogénea y se distinguen diferentes fenotipos clínicos. El diagnóstico se basa en la sospecha y la evaluación conjunta del cuadro clínico con estudios nocturnos confirmatorios adecuados, siguiendo algoritmos propuestos, usando desde PSG convencional hasta equipos simplificados. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) is a common chronic and progressive disorder. It has cardiovascular, neurocognitive and metabolic consequences. Also has increased risk of accident, poor quality of life and higher mortality. About 5% of adult population and 2% of children aged 4 to 5 year are affected. OSAS therapy is efficient and cost effective, so early diagnosis and treatment are important. The hallmark feature is the recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep, which is associated with hypopxia-reoxygenation and microarousal which contributes to the pathophysiology and symptoms which are not specific but quite suggestive of the disease. The typical presentation of OSAS is represented by an overweight, gross neck male patient complaining of loud snoring, nocturia, excessive daytime sleepiness and mild cognitive impairment, with a history of witnessed apnoeas during sleep. Obstructive apnoea has a quite heterogeneous presentation form and different clinical phenotypes have been recognized. OSAS diagnosis is based on a high level of disease suspicion, complete clinical assessment and the adequate sleep study by using diagnostic algorithms.",

The true extent of the problem is not known, but it seems certain that these syndromes are much more common than was generally assumed five years ago. Every clinician should be aware of the signs and symptoms of sleep apnea because of the rapid and prompt response to therapeutic measures. Sleep apnea syndromes, whether obstructive or central, can result in systemic or pulmonary hypertension, arterial blood gas abnormalities, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, chronic respiratory failure, sleep disturbances, narcolepsy, excessive daytime somnolence, sexual dysfunction, and the suspicion of mental retardation. The immediate and dramatic improvement produced by tracheostomy in the obstructive type of sleep apnea, or nocturnal ventilatory support in the central type, can not only enhance the quality of life for these patients, but return them to functional and productive lives.",

Reports from psychophysical studies indicate that the most common declines with ageing are in vision and audition and, to a lesser degree, olfaction and gustation. Findings for the somatosensory system (mechanoreception, warming and cooling thermoreception and pain) are less conclusive. Factors that contribute to individual differences in sensory ratings beyond chronological ageing include stimulus factors including stimulus type and body location, response measures and instructions, systemic disease that may affect the peripheral or central nervous system and environmental factors that may affect the skin integrity.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

Typical sleep duration has reportedly declined over the past half-century or so, probably due to the myriad changes in work and lifestyle that have emerged with our increased reliance on electronic technology. This is problematic, as sleep is critical to so many of our cognitive functions and health. Sleep facilitates memory consolidation, emotional regulation, decision-making and judgment and maintains normal levels of alertness and focus throughout the day. In addition to its effects on cognitive functions, sleep is important for many aspects of physical health and brain repair. During sleep, the brain rids itself of neurotoxins increases the number of brain repairing oligodendrocytes and replenishes depleted energy reserves. Without adequate sleep, people are prone to a host of health related problems, including inflammation, weight gain, and high blood pressure. But while it is easy to point out the problems associated with disrupted or curtailed sleep, it is much less clear how to intervene to improve people’s sleep-wake cycles. Can anything be done to get us back on track?",

The pathogenesis is predominantly due to environmental variables, especially to the child-parent interaction. Besides somatic diseases, as Sleep Related Breathing Disorders, Restless legs syndrome and nocturnal seizures play an etiologic role. Psychological and somatic factors in the development of sleep disorders have in common that they exercise a serious negative impact on cognitive daytime functioning and behavior. In this paper the interdependence of somatic and psychological factors and the relations between disturbed nighttime sleep and impaired daytime functioning will be discussed. Especially in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder these relations can be demonstrated. Conclusions are drawn for a specific, stepwise diagnostic approach in children's sleep disorders.",

Stariji covjek može se smatrati toliko zdravim koliko za svoju svakodnevnicu ima dovoljno snage da se suprotstavi pojavama koje donosi starost, nedacama i svakodnevnim situacijama. Tjelesna istrosenost je relativna i ne ide usporedno sa smanjivanjem dusevnih snaga, a dusevne snage se trebaju pobuditi onda kad je potrebno svladati pojave koje donosi starenje, posebno negativan utjecaj bolesti i vanjskih faktora.\nZdravstveno stanje nije samo posljedica starosne dobi, ali svakako se starenjem povecava mogucnost da se ono narusi i sve brže mijenja. Najcesca stanja koja pogađaju stariju dobnu skupinu su povezana sa srcem i krvožilnim sustavom: hipertenzija i ateroskleroza, u gorim slucajevima infarkt; zatim, veliki je problem dijabetes, promjene u lokomotornom sustavu i sklonost padovima i frakturama. Nerijetko se događa da se uslijed nekih promjena na mozgu pojavi demencija ili druga stanja neuroloske ili psihijatrijske prirode.\nZbog svih navedenih razloga, te pomanjkanja mobilnosti i refleksa, smatra se da stariji vozaci predstavljaju određeni rizik u prometu. Nužan uvjet za ocuvanje sigurnosti na prometnicama su zdravstveni pregledi koji ce prevenirati da zdravstveno i psiholoski nesposoban vozac i dalje upravlja motornim vozilom i dovodi ostale sudionike u prometu u opasnost.\nKako bi utvrdili utjece li promjena zdravstvenog stanja uslijed starenja na vozacke sposobnosti, nasumicno je odabrano 25 ispitanika, vozaca starijih od 65 godina, to jest obrađeni su podaci iz medicinske dokumentacije nakon obavljenog zdravstvenog pregleda kod specijalista medicine rada u Domu zdravlja PGŽ. Rezultati pokazuju da su najcesca stanja i bolesti iz anamneze ispitanika hipertenzija (20%), bolesti krvožilja (14%,) i dijabetes (8%), a cak vise od polovice ispitanika je pretrpjelo frakture ili bilo hospitalizirano. 88% ispitanika je proglaseno ograniceno sposobnima, jedan ispitanik je proglasen sposobnim, a dvoje su proglaseni nesposobnima. Najcesce su Uvjerenja izdana na rok važenja od 2 ili 5 godina Nisu svi istraživaci složni oko odgovora na pitanje jesu li stariji vozaci rizicni, ali statistike za Hrvatsku prema podacima MUP-a govore da stariji vozaci uzrokuju 2/3 nesreca u kojima sudjeluju. Ako uzmemo u obzir da svi stariji vozaci koji su registrirani da posjeduju vozacku dozvolu ne voze, te da voze na znatno kracim relacijama, ovaj postotak je poražavajuci.\nIpak, nakon vise promjena zakona koji regulira kriterije za zdravstveni pregled vozaca , sada je na snazi zakon prema kojem je zdravstveni pregled obavezan samo ako je to navedeno u Uvjerenju dobivenom prije osposobljavanja vozaca. U europskim zemljama zdravstveni pregled je obavezan za starije vozace (Spanjolska, Velika Britanija, Svedska, Norveska), a jedino u Njemackoj je odgovornost o zdravstvenoj sposobnosti povjerena odabranom lijecniku vozaca.

Somewhat confusingly, the term \"dystonia\" has been used to designate a specific type of abnormal movement or posture, a syndrome that occurs secondary to a number of underlying neurologic disorders, and a primary disorder known as \"idiopathic torsion dystonia.\" Dystonic movements can be either slow or rapid and are usually more stereotyped and patterned than movements in chorea (random and unpredictable), myoclonus (brief and shocklike), and tremor (rhythmical and not associated with alterations in posture). Dystonia is characterized by failure of normal reciprocal inhibition, which causes co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles accompanied by excessive contraction of other regional muscles. This chapter is limited to conditions characterized by continuous rather than intermittent dystonia and therefore does not include discussion of the paroxysmal dystonias. Psychogenic dystonia is discussed in Chapter 35 together with other functional movement disorders.",

Sie sind charakterisiert durch Symptome wie Oberbauchschmerzen, Vollegefuhl etc. sowie durch das Fehlen struktureller Lasionen oder biochemischer Abnormalitaten, die diese Symptome erklaren. Die funktionelle Dyspepsie mit auf den Oberbauch bezogenen chronischen oder chronisch rezidivierenden Symptomen ist dabei eine der wichtigsten Erkrankungen, die in der Klinik Anlass gibt fur endoskopische Untersuchungen.\r\nHinsichtlich der Pathogenese der Symptome wird heute angenommen, dass neben Motilitatsstorungen vor allem Veranderungen der gastrointestinalen Sensorik eine zentrale Rolle einnehmen. So sind bei Patienten im Vergleich zu gesunden Probanden die Schwellen fur die Wahrnehmung und das Auftreten von Beschwerden bei mechanischer Distension des Magens signifikant niedriger als bei gesunden Probanden . Neben Unterschieden hinsichtlich der Wahrnehmungsschwellen sind Patienten gekennzeichnet durch gestorte adaptive Veranderungen der Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation oder einer mukosalen Schleimhautschadigung durch nicht-steroidale Antirheumatika (NSAR). Ziel der vorliegenden Untersuchung war es, den Einfluss opioiderger Bahnen fur die Modulation viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen zu erfassen und die Effekte bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie und gesunden Probanden zu vergleichen. In Ubereinstimmung mit anderen fruheren Arbeiten findet sich bei Gesunden ein Anstieg viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation und Behandlung mit NSAR, wahrend die Schwellen bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie abnehmen. Die Gabe von Naloxon, einem unspezifischen Opioidantagonisten, bewirkt bei Gesunden einen signifikant starker ausgepragten Abfall viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen als bei Patienten.

      "title": "Idiopathic Central Sleep Apnea: The past, the present and the future",
      "abstract": "Abstract Idiopathic Central Sleep Apnea/Primary Central Sleep Apnea (ICSA) has been an officially recognized sleep disorder since the 2005 International Classification of Sleep Disorders 2nd edition (ICSD-2) and remains in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 3rd edition (ICSD-3). The literature supports the etiology as “high loop gain/increased controller gain,” along with central sleep apnea (CSA) associated with common diagnoses (e.g. heart failure). Available data place the adult population prevalence at about 0.05% (men) and 0.003% (women), while up to 11% of patients diagnosed with CSA may be classified as ICSA. Symptoms may include nocturnal choking, witnessed apneas, awakenings with the sensation of shortness of breath, restless sleep, insomnia, non-restorative sleep, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and variable degrees of snoring. Per the ICSD-3, ICSA may only be diagnosed if “The disorder [CSA] is not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurologic disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder.” However, a putative diagnosis of ICSA should prompt a comprehensive search for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction without heart failure, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery disease, ischemic central nervous system pathology, acromegaly, and licit or illicit respiratory depressant drug use, which could be a potential cause of CSA. Systematic studies are needed to determine the cost effectiveness of this approach. However, if present, ICSA is excluded and intervention can be initiated for the underlying diagnosis, which may resolve CSA and, importantly, improve outcomes specific to the causative disease. Treatment options for ICSA include devices such as adaptive servo-ventilation or transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation, medications such as acetazolamide, and sleep position training.",

      "title": "Sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders",
      "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness of sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders. Most of the sleep disturbances in neuromuscular disorders are secondary to sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is commonly associated with a slowly developing chronic respiratory failure, particularly in the advanced stages, but the condition often remains unrecognized and untreated. The most common sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is sleep-related hypoventilation which initially manifests during REM sleep and later as the disease advances, it is also noted during non-REM sleep and even during daytime. In addition to the hypoventilation, central and upper airway obstructive apneas as well as hypopneas occur. Hypoventilation during sleep gives rise to hypoxemia and hypercapnea causing chronic respiratory failure. The abnormal blood gases may later persist during the daytime. Some patients may, however, have sleep onset or maintenance insomnia as a result of associated pain, muscle immobility, contractures, joint pains and muscle cramps as well as anxiety and depression.The commonest complaint in patients with neuromuscular disorders associated with sleep-disordered breathing is excessive daytime somnolence as a result of repeated arousals and sleep fragmentation due to sleep hypoventilation and transient nocturnal hypoxemia. Sleep-disordered breathing causing sleep disturbance is well known in patients with poliomyelitis, postpolio syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease, primary muscle disorders including muscular dystrophies and myotonic dystrophy, congenital or acquired myopathies, neuromuscular junctional disorders and polyneuropathies. All of these conditions may cause weakness of the diaphragm, the intercostal and accessory muscles of respiration causing breathlessness and other respiratory dysrhythmias. As a result of the respiratory and upper airway muscle weakness, the normal sleep-related respiratory physiologic vulnerability becomes pathological in these patients with neuro-muscular disorders causing hypoventilation or central and upper airway obstructive apneas during sleep. Multiple factors are responsible for sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders causing sleep hypoventilation and other respiratory dysrhythmias, and these include: impaired chest bellows, increased work of breathing, hypo-responsive respiratory chemoreceptors, increased upper airway resistance, decreased minute and alveolar ventilation, REM-related marked hypotonia or atonia of the respiratory muscles except the diaphragm, respiratory muscle fatigue and kyphoscoliosis secondary to neuromuscular disorders causing extrapulmonary restriction of the lungs. Nocturnal hypoventilation and chronic respiratory failure in neuromuscular disorders may present insidiously and initially may remain asymptomatic. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed. Clinical clues suggesting sleep-disordered breathing include daytime hypersomnolence, breathlessness, disturbed nocturnal sleep and unexplained leg edema. If the clinical clues strongly suggest sleep-disordered breathing, a physical examination must be directed to uncover bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness. Patients with neuromuscular disorders showing these clinical features must be investigated to uncover nocturnal hypoventilation to prevent serious consequences of chronic.",

Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) share clinical and genetic components that have long been recognized. The two disorders co-occur more frequently than would be predicted by their respective prevalence, suggesting that a complex, multifactor association is involved. However, DSM-5 maintains the distinction between ASD, with core social and communication impairments, and SSD, including schizophrenia (SCZ), with hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder as essential features. ASD and SSD have common biological underpinnings that may emerge early in development and unfold over time. One of the hypotheses supporting the similarities in the social and cognitive disturbances of ASD and SSD relates to abnormalities in the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory cortical activity (E/I imbalance). E/I imbalance in neurodevelopmental disorders could be the consequence of abnormalities in genes coding for glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors or synaptic proteins followed by system derangements. SSD and ASD have been characterized as polygenic disorders in which to the onset and progression of disease is triggered by interactions among multiple genes. Mammalian target of rapamycin signaling is under intense investigation as a convergent altered pathway in the two spectrum disorders. Current understanding of shared and divergent patterns between ASD and SSD from molecular to clinical aspects is still incomplete and may be implemented by the research domain criteria approach.",

In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child9s period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

We recommend a primary survey followed by a secondary survey with special attention to immediate life-threatening reversible causes. We then recommend a systems-based approach searching for any other life-threatening or reversible causes.

Other definitions exist, and there is no clear consensus in this matter. The core elements of insomnia are an inadequate quantity or quality of sleep, with both nocturnal and daytime consequences. Traditionally, insomnia has been subgrouped into sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintaining insomnia, and insomnia with early morning awakening; however, there is extensive overlap, and most insomniacs fit into more than one subgroup. Sleep disorders, particularly in the elderly, are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality, significant limitations in activities of daily living, and impaired quality of life. Aside from the obvious complications of daytime fatigue and somnolence, insomniacs have an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, increased use of over-the-counter medications and alcohol, and a higher incidence of accidents and unemployment. Chronic sleep loss has multisystem consequences and may represent a risk factor for obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. However, the brunt of negative effects of sleep deprivation is borne by the brain. Chronic insomnia independently predicts incident cognitive decline in older men, but it also has been suggested that some degree of apparent age-related cognitive decline may be due to treatable insomnia.",

This study aims to explore patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences of these symptoms. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using narrative semi-structured interviews with 25 narcolepsy patients, guided by a structure approved by a multidisciplinary expert board. The interviews, conducted at the patients’ homes or hospitals, were transcribed, inductively analyzed to develop a codebook, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The onset and manifestation were key themes for each symptom. EDS was often described as “microsleeps” or “shutting off,” causing embarrassment when occurring publicly and influenced by factors such as the weather, seasons, or menstruation. Cataplexy was commonly triggered by positive emotions or situations, including sexual intercourse, with patients often suppressing emotions to prevent episodes, leading to misinterpretations by others as drunkenness. Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including vivid dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, led to negative emotional experiences. Overall, narcolepsy symptoms significantly impacted patients’ emotional well-being. Conclusion The burden of narcolepsy is deeply tied to patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences, significantly affecting their quality of life, yet few studies have used qualitative approaches to explore their perspectives.",

      "title": "Parasomnias and Movement Disorders of Sleep",
      "abstract": "Neurologists are often enlisted to help diagnose, evaluate, and manage a spectrum of abnormal spells during the night ranging from parasomnias to motor disturbance that span the sleep-wake cycle. Parasomnias are undesirable emotional or physical events that accompany sleep. These events typically occur during entry into sleep from wakefulness, or during arousals from sleep, and are often augmented by the sleep state. Some parasomnias, such as the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder may be extremely undesirable, while others such as somniloquy are often of little concern. The parasomnias include a spectrum of abnormal emotions, movements, behaviors, sensory perceptions, dream mentation, and autonomic activity. Basic physiologic drives, such as sex, hunger, and aggression, may manifest as sleep-related eating, sleep-related sexual behaviors, and sleep-related violence. Parasomnias have a very bizarre nature, but are readily explainable, diagnosable, and treatable. They are hypothesized to be due to changes in brain organization across multiple states of being, and are particularly apt to occur during the incomplete transition or oscillation from one sleep state to another. Parasomnias are often explained on the basis that wakefulness and sleep are not mutually exclusive states, and abnormal intrusion of wakefulness into non-REM (NREM) sleep produces arousal disorders, and intrusion of wakefulness into REM sleep produces REM sleep parasomnias and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), two closely related conditions that often result in disturbed sleep onset and sleep maintenance, are also reviewed in this article. Although the mechanisms that underlie idiopathic RLS or PLMD are not fully understood, there is currently substantial evidence that dopaminergic dysfunction is likely involved in both conditions. The discussion will conclude with the \"other parasomnias\" and sleep-related movement disorders of clinical interest to the neurologist.",

      "abstract": "A stressor above a threshold magnitude, or multiple stressors applied simultaneously, cause an organism to alter its behaviour and physiology, with the aim of maintaining homeostasis. The adaptive changes that occur are coordinated and mediated by the stress system in the central nervous system (which includes corticotrophin-releasing hormone and noradrenergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem, respectively), and its peripheral limbs, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic (sympathetic) system. Controlled or self-driven challenges to homeostasis and a normally functioning stress system are crucial for normal development and preservation of self and species. In childhood and adolescence, appropriately functioning neuroendocrine responses to stressors are necessary to allow growth and psychosexual maturation to progress normally. Maladaptive neuroendocrine responses, i.e. dysregulation of the stress system, may lead to disturbances in growth and development and cause psychiatric, endocrine/metabolic and/or autoimmune diseases or vulnerability to such diseases, not only during childhood and adolescence, but also in adulthood.",

Dyssomnia is a primary psychogenic condition in which the main disturbance is the amount, quality or timing of sleep caused by emotional issues, for example: insomnia, hypersomnia, disturbed sleep-wake schedule. In Indonesia, the prevalence rate of insomnia is around 67%. Meanwhile, 55.8% had mild insomnia and 23.3% had moderate insomnia. The use of mindfulness-based therapies for insomnia, which are based on mindfulness mediation, guided imagery, and biofeedback, can also be incorporated into treatment. By doing yoga, especially breathing techniques or pranayama, it can make a person more focused, calm the mind, reduce stress levels, give a feeling of calm and comfort to the body, so it is hoped that it can overcome insomnia.

Dystonic movements are typically patterned, associated with twisting of body parts, and may have tremulousness. Dystonia is usually initiated or worsened by voluntary action and associated with overflow muscle activation. Cervical dystonia (CD) is the most prevalent form of dystonia. CD is a condition characterized by cranial muscle overactivity leading to abnormal intermittent or continuous posturing of the head. Non-motor symptoms are comorbidity of dystonia, which significantly hampers the quality of life among these patients. The symptoms can be as a result of the dystonia itself. However, studies have highlighted the involvement of cortical-striatal-thalamocortical circuits in primary dystonia that could be the pathophysiological basis for the non-motor symptoms. The non-motor symptoms that are commonly associated with dystonia are anxiety, depression, restless leg syndrome, excessive daytime sleepiness, cognitive disturbances, and poor sleep. This review attempts to summarize the literature on non-motor symptoms in patients with CD.",

Fragmentation and repetitive arousals/awakenings characterize the sleep of persons with dementia. Confusion, agitation, and wandering can occur at night (“sun downing”), further contributing to sleep disruption (Box 10–1). Sleep complaints may be due primarily to the underlying dementia or to related sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements of sleep, or secondary depression. Reversal of the sleep-wake rhythms can be seen with patients complaining of nocturnal insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography may demonstrate decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and REM density. Sleep efficiency is reduced. Management includes proper sleep hygiene practices (eg, avoiding caffeine, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and eliminating daytime naps), and treatment of concurrent depression and medical disorders, including pain syndromes, that might contribute to sleep disturbance. Short-term use of hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, or eszopiclone, may be tried for insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Neurologic disorders impact the ability of the brain to regulate sleep, wake, and circadian functions, including state generation, components of state (such as rapid eye movement sleep muscle atonia, state transitions) and electroencephalographic microarchitecture. At its most extreme, extensive brain damage may even prevent differentiation of sleep stages from wakefulness (eg, status dissociatus). Given that comorbid sleep-wake-circadian disorders are common and can adversely impact the occurrence, evolution, and management of underlying neurologic conditions, new technologies for long-term monitoring of neurologic patients may potentially usher in new diagnostic strategies and optimization of clinical management.",

In bipolar disorders, both depressive and manic episodes occur sequentially. A manic episode is characterised as an abnormally excited mood that is experienced by a patient for a distinct period (at least a week). Diagnosis of mania requires that a patient’s work and social life be significantly affected, or that the patient needs hospitalisation. Diagnosis also requires the presence of three or more of the following symptoms: inflated self-esteem or grandiosity; decreased need for sleep; increased talkativeness; racing thoughts/ideas; distraction; increased goal-directed activity; excessive involvement in pleasurable activities [1].",

      "title": "Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",
      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

      "title": "Depressão puerperal e seu difícil diagnóstico",
      "abstract": "Introdução: O parto é um processo difícil e exaustivo, e no puerpério, a mulher passa por um período de grande vulnerabilidade, associado a intensas alterações físicas e emocionais. A depressão pós-parto ocorre mais comumente 6 semanas após o parto, em cerca de 6,5% a 20% das mulheres. Embora as mulheres que sofrem de tristeza pós-parto tendem a se recuperar rapidamente, a depressão puerperal tende a durar mais tempo e afeta gravemente a capacidade das mulheres de retornar às funções normais. Por ser definida como um transtorno depressivo maior, exigem critérios de diagnóstico, como sintomas de humor deprimido ou a perda de interesse ou prazer nas atividades presentes por pelo menos duas semanas. Além disso, podem estar presentes distúrbios do sono, distúrbios do apetite, perda de energia, sentimentos de inutilidade ou culpa, diminuição da concentração e pensamentos suicidas. O diagnóstico e o tratamento da depressão pós-parto são desafiadores, isso porque as alterações nos padrões de sono e no apetite, além da fadiga excessiva, são rotina para as mulheres após o parto, e nem todo tratamento trará benefícios à paciente. Objetivo: O presente trabalho tem como objetivo evidenciar a importância e o diagnóstico da depressão puerperal. Métodos: Para a confecção desta revisão de literatura, foi realizada pesquisa nas bases de dados Medical Literature Analysis and Retrievel System Online (MEDLINE), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) e Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS), além de documentos oficiais do Ministério da Saúde. Na busca, foram utilizadas as palavras-chave “depressão puerperal”, “gestação” e “transtornos psiquiátricos”. Foram aplicados os filtros “revisão bibliografica” e “relato de caso”. A amostra de estudo foi composta por textos em português e inglês com publicação no intervalo entre os anos de 2020 e 2024. Aplicando-se esses critérios, 20 artigos foram pesquisados, dos quais 8 deles foram selecionados. Resultados: Os resultados destacam a prevalência significativa da depressão puerperal em todo o mundo, bem como fatores de risco conhecidos, como história prévia de transtornos mentais, falta de apoio social, eventos estressantes durante a gestação e parto complicado. Além disso, as abordagens de triagem e diagnóstico; intervenções terapêuticas, incluindo psicoterapia e farmacoterapia; e medidas preventivas para reduzir o impacto da depressão puerperal na saúde materna e infantil ainda são controversas e precisam ser individualizadas de acordo com cada paciente. Conclusões: A depressão puerperal é uma condição que tem se tornado cada vez mais comum e que requer atenção cuidadosa por parte dos profissionais de saúde. Estratégias de triagem eficazes, intervenções terapêuticas baseadas em evidências e apoio contínuo são fundamentais para identificar e tratar adequadamente mulheres afetadas por essa condição. Além disso, políticas de saúde pública que promovam o acesso equitativo a cuidados de saúde mental perinatais são essenciais para mitigar os efeitos adversos da depressão puerperal na saúde materna e infantil.",

Se caracteriza por presentar síntomas vestibulares y/o auditivos inducidos por ruidos intensos o cambios de presión, lo que afecta la calidad de vida de quienes la sufren. Este síndrome se explicaría por un fenómeno de “tercera ventana” móvil entre el canal semicircular superior desprovisto de su cubierta ósea (por causas congénitas y/o secundarias) y la duramadre adyacente, permitiendo una nueva vía de descompresión a los estímulos acústicos, los cuales se disipan parcialmente a la cóclea y al laberinto vestibular, generando los síntomas de la enfermedad. El diagnóstico es clínico, siendo fundamental la anamnesis dirigida, apoyado por exámenes funcionales cócleo-vestibulares sugerentes del efecto biomecánico de la dehiscencia, y corroborado con estudio de imágenes (TC de oído, RM de cerebro). Ante el diagnóstico comprobado de un SDCSS es importante dar a conocer la situación al paciente y los eventuales tratamientos: conservador, consistente en medidas generales que eviten los estímulos desencadenantes de la sintomatología, y quirúrgico, cuando los síntomas son invalidantes. Los accesos más frecuentes son por fosa media y transmastoideo, siendo el primero el más utilizado en Neurocirugía. Describimos aquí el caso de una paciente con un SDCSS bilateral que afectaba enormemente su calidad de vida. Fue tratada quirúrgicamente a través de la fosa media, logrando una remisión casi completa de sus síntomas.

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "title": "The circadian organization of the cardiovascular system in health and disease.",
      "abstract": "In normal conditions, the temporal organization of blood pressure (BP) is mainly controlled by neuroendocrine mechanisms. Above all, the monoaminergic systems (including variations in activity of the autonomous nervous system, and in secretion of biogenic amines) appear to integrate the major driving factors of temporal variability, but evidence is available also for a role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid, opioid, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, and endothelial systems, as well as other vasoactive peptides. Many hormones with established actions on the cardiovascular system (arginine vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, melatonin, somatotropin, insulin, steroids, serotonin, CRF, ACTH, TRH, endogenous opioids, and prostaglandin E2) are also involved in sleep induction or arousal, which in turn affects BP regulation. Hence, physical, mental, and pathological stimuli which may drive activation or inhibition of these neuroendocrine effectors of biological rhythmicity, may also interfere with the temporal BP structure. On the other hand, the immediate adaptation of the exogenous components of BP rhythms to the demands of the environment are modulated by the circadian-time-dependent responsiveness of the biological oscillators and their neuroendocrine effectors. These notions may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology and therapeutics of hypertension, myocardial ischemia and infarction, cardiac arrhythmias and all kind of acute cardiovascular accidents. For instance, the normal temporal balance between external stimuli and neurohumoral influences with endogenous rhythmicity is preserved in uncomplicated, essential hypertension, whereas it is frequently lost in complicated and secondary forms of hypertension where gross alterations are found in the circadian profile of BP. When all the gates of the critical physiologic functions are aligned at the same time, the susceptibility, and thus risk, of adverse events becomes extremely high, even in the presence of minor environmental stimuli that could be usually harmless, and circadian rhythms of cardiovascular events are observed. This implies that one cannot afford to miss what happens during day but also night. Moreover, the requirement for preventive and therapeutic interventions varies predictably during the 24 h, suggesting that the delivery of protective or preventive medications should be synchronized in time in proportion to need, as determined by established rhythmic patterns in cardiovascular function as well as risk, in a manner that will avert or minimize their undesired side effects.",

Cramps and improper breathing appear during speech. Stuttering is accompanied by physical symptoms that appear in stressful communication with the child. Stuttering is widespread in the world, and it originates from ancient times. First, it occurs between the second and third years of life, when speech develops intensively, but it may occur later. The cause of stuttering is explained by three theories: constitutional, developmental and environmental. The speech-language development of children is increasingly influenced by the media, which have become an important part of everyday life. There are more division of stuttering. The first division is on physiological, primary, secondary and acute / abrupt stuttering, while the other is psychogenic and neurogenic, which appear later in life. There are five stages of stuttering development, of which three stages appear during preschool age (developmental speech failure, border stinging, initial stuttering), stage during school age (transient stuttering) and stage during adolescence and further (advanced stuttering). Speech therapy is performed with the child - indirect and direct, before which diagnostic procedures are required. The child has fear of speaking and situations that require speaking, which affect his psychological state and selfconfidence. It is therefore important to provide support and encourage it in progress. A research was carried out to find out how often preschool teachers have interactions with a child who has a speech disorder and in cooperation with a therapist carries out speech excerises, how often do they cooperate with the child's parents and in which way those children included in working with other children. The results show that most preschool teachers do not consider themselves competent to work with children with a speech disorder, but they have cooperated with parents in every possible way. These children were daily involved in the work of the group that contributes to their further growth and development.",

      "abstract": "Стресорні чинники викликають у різних людей і навіть в однієї людини відмінні й навіть протилежні реакції. Вплив різноманітних чинників на організм можливо розподілити за силою дії на підпорогові, порогові, стресові (надзвичайні) та руйнівні. При виникненні стресових ситуацій в організмі людини активуються резерви адаптації. Тривала дія сильних стресорів з різко негативною емоційною оцінкою і можливими небажаними згубними наслідками для здоров’я спричиняє формування «дистресу» — прояву найбільш руйнівного стресорного ефекту. Дистрес — стан, при якому людина не в змозі повністю адаптуватися до стресових ситуацій та спричинених ними наслідків. Для нього характерні втома, дратівливість, втрата сексуального потягу до партнера і ряд індивідуальних особливостей. Дистрес може виявлятися у 2 формах — гострій та хронічній. При гострій формі надмірно сильний стресор викликає значний викид катехоламінів і глюкокортикоїдів, підвищення кров’яного тиску і різке пригнічення імунітету. При хронічному дистресі сильний стресор призводить до виснаження резервів цих гормонів. Це створює тло для формування важкої депресії. Дистрес при тривалому перебігу може призводити до неврозів та психозів. Дані багатьох досліджень свідчать, що у хворих на цукровий діабет (ЦД) часто зустрічається низка психологічних проблем і психічних розладів. Для ЦД характерна гіперактивація симпатоадреналової та гіпоталамо-гіпофізарної системи, що сприяє виділенню стресових гормонів і підвищенню нервово-психічної напруги на тлі хронічного стресу. Відзначається двонапрямна взаємодія між ЦД та стресом — з одного боку, стрес сприяє розвитку захворювання, а з іншого боку, при ЦД посилюється стресорна реакція і створюються передумови формування дистресу. Психологічний дистрес є однією з причин зниження фізичної активності людини внаслідок депресивних настроїв, які можуть виникати на тлі ЦД, внаслідок чого перебіг захворювання ускладнюється. Дистрес посилює страждання хворих і впливає на результативність лікування. У хворих на ЦД дистрес виявляється у 2 рази частіше, ніж у людей без ЦД. Дистрес потребує відповідних засобів для його вивчення. Поєднання таких чинників, як наявність ЦД, перенесене захворювання на COVID-19, а також страждань, викликаних війною, можуть сприяти обтяженню розвитку діабетичного дистресу. У публікації розглянуті питання підходів для дослідження дистресу і його особливостей у хворих на ЦД, зокрема, у постковідному періоді та в умовах війни.",

      "title": "Long‐Term Effects of Pilocarpine in Rats: Structural Damage of the Brain Triggers Kindling and Spontaneous I Recurrent Seizures",
      "abstract": "Structural damage of the human brain (perinatal damage, cerebral trauma, head injury, cerebrovascular and degenerative diseases, intracranial tumor, metabolic diseases, toxins, drug-induced seizures) may lead to chronic epilepsy in survivors. Epidemiologic analyses show that a considerable time-delay occurs between the exposure of the brain to injury and the appearance of seizures. Such seizures are usually partial or mixed, may develop at any age, and are difficult to treat. In rats subjected to structural damage of the brain induced by sustained convulsions triggered by systemic administration of the cholinergic agent pilocarpine, spontaneous seizures may develop after a mean latency of 14-15 days. The mean frequency of spontaneous recurrent convulsions remains constant for several months. Evolution of these convulsions proceeds through several electrographic and behavioral stages resembling kindling. Kindling may be otherwise induced in rodents by repeated systemic administration of convulsants or by repeated electrical stimulation of sensitive brain regions. These observations demonstrate that structural damage of the brain may lead to spontaneously recurrent convulsions (chronic epilepsy) in rats and that kindling may be involved in the evolution of such a condition. This finding suggests that kindling mechanisms underlie the development of epileptic foci from structural brain lesions. Such mechanisms may be involved in the etiology of some forms of epilepsy in humans.",

      "abstract": "There is often a lack of identified causal biological mechanisms or biological differences of structure or process for many psychiatric diagnostic constructs. There is a lack of useful biomarkers common to all people who meet criteria for a psychiatric diagnostic construct that differentiates them from the healthy population. This can also be the case for general medical conditions for both aetiology and differences in structure or process and sometimes lack of useful biomarkers but this occurs to a lesser extent. There are also occasions when medical conditions cause mental health problems directly. For this reason doctors will always be involved in mental health to some degree and will use diagnostic constructs to describe these conditions as they are familiar with diagnosis in their medical practice. There are examples of clear biological abnormalities that are often detected accidentally that do not require treatment. Medically unexplained or functional symptoms/syndromes are commonly seen in general medicine, although the term ‘medically unexplained’ is contentious. Many diagnostic constructs—medical or psychiatric—involve complex polygenetic interactions with the environment.",

      "abstract": "No es un secreto que estudiar medicina se caracteriza por tener altas cargas académicas, estar expuesto al sufrimiento de los pacientes y, en algunos casos, a sus muertes, lo que puede generar estrés y ansiedad. No obstante, existen algunos vacíos de conocimiento en relación con esta problemática. Por ejemplo, aún no está del todo claro, por la poca evidencia disponible, cómo se relacionan el estrés académico y los hábitos de estudio inadecuados o la ansiedad y la somnolencia diurna en un ambiente educativo con estas características. Si estas asociaciones se demuestran, o se llegan a entender mejor, se podría concluir entonces que estudiar medicina (en particular) o una carrera universitaria con demandas académicas y emocionales similares (en general), tendría un nexo causal con los problemas de salud vinculados con la ansiedad, las alteraciones del sueño y los altos índices de estrés. Estos problemas incluyen, por ejemplo, las enfermedades mentales, como la depresión, o las alteraciones cardiovasculares, como la hipertensión arterial. Adicionalmente, vivir una experiencia de aprendizaje con este tipo de tensiones puede desencadenar dificultades para la concentración y la memoria, procesos que son fundamentales para el éxito académico.",

The usual environmental and psychological factors that influence maturation are modified by the attitudes of other persons toward the disabled one and by his own attitudes toward his defects and the limitations which they impose upon him. During the first few formative years, the normal child develops increasing physical independence as his motility and equilibrium patterns mature, enabling him to erect himself against gravity and to locomote independently. This growing capability is paralleled by the ego development and the appreciation of body image concept. The development of speech is a major step in communication and greatly facilitates the child's contact with his environment. The alteration of these patterns of maturation by central or peripheral neuromuscular disorders may influence profoundly the individual's personality. This results from the anxiety",

      "abstract": "While insomnia is the second most common mental disorder, progress in our understanding of underlying neurobiological mechanisms has been limited. The present review addresses the definition and prevalence of insomnia and explores its subjective and objective characteristics across the 24-hour day. Subsequently, the review extensively addresses how the vulnerability to develop insomnia is affected by genetic variants, early life stress, major life events, and brain structure and function. Further supported by the clear mental health risks conveyed by insomnia, the integrated findings suggest that the vulnerability to develop insomnia could rather be found in brain circuits regulating emotion and arousal than in circuits involved in circadian and homeostatic sleep regulation. Finally, a testable model is presented. The model proposes that in people with a vulnerability to develop insomnia, the locus coeruleus is more sensitive to-or receives more input from-the salience network and related circuits, even during rapid eye movement sleep, when it should normally be sound asleep. This vulnerability may ignite a downward spiral of insufficient overnight adaptation to distress, resulting in accumulating hyperarousal, which, in turn, impedes restful sleep and moreover increases the risk of other mental health adversity. Sensitized brain circuits are likely to be subjectively experienced as \"sleeping with one eye open\". The proposed model opens up the possibility for novel intervention studies and animal studies, thus accelerating the ignition of a neuroscience of insomnia, which is direly needed for better treatment.",

      "title": "The condition of insomnia: Etiopathogenetic considerations and their impact on treatment practices",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.",

      "abstract": "Parmi les problématiques psychiques susceptibles d’entraver ou de soutenir le traitement des conflits engagés par l’expérience du vieillissement et/ou du handicap, la question des identifications sexuelles se révèle nodale. En effet, outre la question identitaire, des assises narcissiques et de la différenciation moi/non moi, la question des identifications secondaires mobilisées par les différences des sexes et des générations se révèle être une dynamique majeure du rapport que toute personne peut entretenir avec son corps. Le vécu des limitations liées à l’expérience du handicap, et de celles, plus communes, liées à la traversée du vieillissement et de la vieillesse – qu’elles soient brutales ou insidieuses, aiguës ou chroniques –, entretient des rapports complexes avec les fantasmes de castration et de passivité. L’expérience de psychothérapies analytiques d’hommes qui, pour cause accidentelle traumatique (chute, accident de la voie publique), ou pour cause de fragilité somatique (accident vasculaire cérébral), se retrouvent en situation de handicap (avec des séquelles plus ou moins invalidantes) et vieillissent ainsi, permet de discerner combien la question des identifications féminines joue un rôle capital dans l’élaboration des conflits psychiques inhérents à cette rencontre entre vieillissement et handicap. L’auteur propose d’illustrer cette question clinique par l’exposé des grandes étapes de la psychothérapie d’un homme de 75 ans qui permet de saisir comment la rigidité puis la souplesse des identifications sexuelles, de la revendication de la puissance à la possibilité d’y renoncer au profit de l’acceptation d’une certaine passivité-jouissance, organisent, gênent ou élaborent le conflit psychique et, partant, les relations aux proches, aux enfants, aux femmes et aux hommes.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

Approximately 10% of the general population and 20% of primary care attendees suffer from severe insomnia. Clinical hallmarks of sleeplessness are the patients' complaints about insufficient and non-restorative sleep, severe daytime consequences without any tendency to fall asleep and presence of symptoms on three days per week for more than one month. Insomniacs tend to suffer from psycho-physiologic hyperarousal that prevents physical and mental relaxation. They are more susceptible to stress and seem to have a high sympathetic drive. Insomnia therefore has been compared to chronic caffeine intoxication. It must he pointed out that insomnia is probably more a qualitative rather than a quantitative disorder of sleep. Neither doctors nor patients routinely talk about disturbed sleep during consultations which might he one reason why insomnia very often goes undiagnosed. Consequently, physicians should routinely inquire afoul their patients' sleep and sleeping habits and take, if appropriate, a full sleep history on the basis of which further investigational and therapeutic steps can be planned: well-established tools of proved efficacy are available to treat both primary and secondary insomnia. Acute or transient insomnia lasting less than four weeks can he treated with hypnotics. Chronic insomnia is the domain of nonpharmacological psychotherapy, which can be conducted in a single or group setting.",

      "abstract": "Cortical arousal from sleep is associated with autonomic activation and acute increases in heart rate. Arousals vary considerably in their frequency, intensity/duration, and physiological effects. Sleep and arousability impact health acutely (daytime cognitive function) and long-term (cardiovascular outcomes). Yet factors that modify the arousal intensity and autonomic activity remain enigmatic. In this study of healthy human adults, we examined whether reflex airway defense mechanisms, specifically swallowing or glottic adduction, influenced cardiac autonomic activity and cortical arousal from sleep. We found, in all subjects, that swallows trigger rapid, robust, and patterned tachycardia conserved across wake, sleep, and arousal states. Tachycardia onset was temporally matched to glottic adduction-the first phase of swallow motor program. Multiple swallows increase the magnitude of tachycardia via temporal summation, and blood pressure increases as a function of the degree of tachycardia. During sleep, swallows were overwhelmingly associated with arousal. Critically, swallows were causally linked to the intense, prolonged cortical arousals and marked tachycardia. Arousal duration and tachycardia increased in parallel as a function of swallow incidence. Our findings suggest that cortical feedback and tachycardia are integrated responses of the swallow motor program. Our work highlights the functional influence of episodic, involuntary airway defense reflexes on sleep and vigilance and cardiovascular function in healthy individuals.",

Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico.

Static asymmetry is additive with induced asymmetry and manifests itself as directional preponderance or as the direction-fixed or direction-changing feature of positional nystagmus.<i>Dynamic asymmetry</i>refers to abnormal asymmetry induced by normal head movements. For example, with unilateral hypo-function, a greater gain is observed with head movement toward the unaffected side, suggesting nonlinearity as specified by Ewald's second law. Visually induced<i>vestibular asymmetry</i>is a form of dynamic asymmetry generated by convergence of visual-vestibular information, and causing symptoms in certain \"motion-active\" visual environments.

Solitary confinement and prolonged sleep deprivation are just two examples of these psychological torture methods. Even psychological methods which do not amount to ill-treatment when considered in isolation, amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, when applied in conjunction with other techniques, cumulatively and/or over a long time. Often they are part and parcel of the whole torture process and constitute a “background environment” of harassment and duress. The “cumulation over time” factor must thus be considered as part of a system of psychological torture.",

      "title": "Epilepsy, sleep and neuropeptides. Future directions",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy and sleep are intimately linked; patients with epilepsy frequently present sleep disorders and alterations in sleep quality and architecture. This, in turn, leads to greater prevalence of psychiatric and cognitive comorbidities and poorer quality of life. Sleep is a physiological process regulated by the circadian rhythm. The sleep–wake cycle occurs as a result of the reciprocal activity of numerous regions and circuits in the brain, via neuromediators. The different stages of sleep also influence the propagation of interictal epileptiform discharges and epileptic seizures. Non-rapid eye movement sleep facilitates their propagation, whereas rapid eye movement sleep suppresses it. This connection is made even more evident by the existence of epileptic syndromes that occur only or mainly during specific stages of the sleep–wake cycle. Antiepileptic drugs also influence this cycle. Better sleep quality may have positive effects on seizure control, and vice versa. New therapeutic targets involve the sleep–wake cycle, with orexin receptor antagonists having been proposed as a potential antiepileptic treatment. However, more research and controlled clinical trials are needed to corroborate these findings. La epilepsia y el sueño están íntimamente relacionados y los pacientes con epilepsia (PCE) presentan con frecuencia trastornos de sueño, alteraciones en la calidad de sueño y de su arquitectura. Todo ello conlleva una mayor prevalencia de comorbilidades psiquiátricas, cognitivas y una peor calidad de vida. El sueño es un proceso fisiológico regulado por el ritmo circadiano. El ciclo sueño/vigilia tiene lugar mediante la actividad recíproca de diversas regiones y circuitos cerebrales a través de neuromediadores. Por otro lado, las distintas fases del sueño influyen en la propagación de descargas epileptiformes intercríticas (DEI) y de crisis epilépticas (CE). El sueño NREM facilita su propagación y el sueño REM la dificulta. Esta conexión se hace todavía más evidente debido a que hay síndromes epilépticos que ocurren sólo o principalmente durante determinadas fases del ciclo sueño/vigilia. Los diferentes tratamientos empleados en epilepsia también influyen en el sueño. Es posible que una mejora en la calidad de sueño tenga repercusiones positivas en el control de las crisis epilépticas y viceversa. se han explorado nuevas dianas terapéuticas implicadas en el ciclo sueño/vigilia proponiendo los antagonistas de la de orexina como potenciales agentes antiepilépticos. Sin embargo, se precisan más estudios y ensayos controlados para contrastar estos hallazgos.",

      "abstract": "Summary Sleep paralysis is a sensation of an inability to speak or move other muscles when falling asleep or awakening. Sleep paralysis by itself has been reported as occurring infrequently and many clinicians are uncertain of its significance. In contrast, sleep paralysis in conjunction with sleep attacks has been reported as a concomitant of narcolepsy. To further examine the incidence of sleep paralysis, the responses of 80 first-year medical students (69 men, 11 women) to a questionnaire were analyzed. Of the sample studied, 16.25% had experienced predormital, postdormital, or both types of sleep paralysis. These episodes occurred infrequently—only once or twice for most of these students. Reports of sleep paralysis were not associated with sleep attacks or cataplexy. These results support two previous studies which found that sleep paralysis alone occurs frequently among normals.",

      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is an umbrella term that defines a group of non-progressive, but often changing, syndromes of motor impairment secondary to lesions or anomalies of the brain arising in the early stages of its development.1 2 The characteristic clinical feature that is common to all CP syndromes is the presence of pyramidal or extrapyramidal signs. CP is neither a specific disease nor a pathological or aetiological entity, and importantly the term CP does not—and should not—necessarily imply or identify a specific cause. The prevalence of CP ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 per 1000 live births, with the risk highest among very preterm and low birthweight babies. However, the majority of children with CP are born at or near term gestation. Causes of CP include perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, intra- or periventricular haemorrhage, cerebral dysgenesis, and intracranial infection. The CP syndromes may be classified by the predominant type of motor disturbance, including, for example, diplegia, tetraplegia, hemiplegia, dyskinesia, and ataxia, although frequently the overall clinical picture is not always pure. Finally, the aetiologies for these different syndromes tend to be quite distinct.\n\nOnce a diagnosis of CP has been made on the basis of the child's symptoms and signs, each child should undergo appropriate evaluation and investigation to try and establish a cause and specifically to determine whether it is of prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal origin. Investigation is indicated even when there has been evidence of a preceding neurological event during the perinatal period or infancy, because some of these children may have an underlying neurological or metabolic disorder which may have made them more vulnerable to the stresses of delivery and extrauterine life. Finally, it is important that all children with a diagnosis of CP should be followed up, and when no obvious cause has been identified or there …",

      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia is the most common sleep disorder, affecting up to 10% of the global population, with more than one-third of the individuals worldwide reporting insufficient sleep as a common complaint. Due to its high prevalence, insomnia frequently co-exists with various somatic and psychiatric disorders, exhibiting a bidirectional relationship in which each condition influences the other. Depression, anxiety, cardiovascular diseases, and malignancies can serve as factors triggering insomnia complaints, according to the behavioral model for insomnia development. Moreover, chronic insomnia increases the risk of these diseases through several pathogenic mechanisms, including activated stress response, altered neurotransmitter signaling, and impaired emotion regulation. This interplay creates a vicious cycle of poor sleep, deteriorated health, and impaired quality of life. Recognizing the relationship between insomnia and overall well-being is essential for adopting optimal treatment methodology, as addressing insomnia can ameliorate associated mental and physical health issues. This review explores the bidirectional association of chronic insomnia with other somatic and mental diseases, illustrating how each can aggravate the other, and emphasizes the importance of effective insomnia management in improving overall health and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Pain is well known to be a common dominant symptom in people with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). Perhaps less well acknowledged by healthcare professionals are fatigue and sleep disturbances in these patients. Individually these symptoms are problematic but when combined their effect and impact on patients' lives is greatly amplified; often leaving people in a vicious cycle whereby being in pain results in poor sleep leading to fatigue the next day, which lowers patients' pain tolerance resulting in a poorer night\"s sleep, more fatigue and increased pain. Pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance greatly reduce quality of life for people with RMDs. Patients have to adapt their daily and leisure activities, or give them up altogether with negative psychological consequences such as anxiety and depression. Patients can end up feeling helpless and sometimes suicidal. Relationships with partners and friends are often altered affecting their sexual and social lives. Major life decisions, such as having a baby, can be put on hold or shelved. People with RMDs may also have to reduce their working hours or stop working, which has financial repercussions for them and their families. This can exacerbate stress, anxiety and depression leading to poorer health outcomes. It is therefore of great importance that healthcare professionals understand the extent to which pain, fatigue and sleep difficulties impact on patients' lives so that priority can be given to addressing these distressing symptoms as part of any management strategy. <h3>Disclosure of Interests:</h3> None declared",

Sleep-onset and maintenance insomnia is a characteristic feature of schizophrenic patients regardless of either their medication status (drug-naive or previously treated) or the phase of the clinical course (acute or chronic). Regarding sleep architecture, the majority of studies indicate that stage 4 sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) latency are reduced in schizophrenia, whereas REM sleep duration tends to remain unchanged. Insomnia in schizophrenic patients could be partly related to the presumed over-activity of the dopaminergic system. However, there is a possibility that the GABAergic system is also involved in sleep disturbance in schizophrenia. Since many signal transmission systems within the CNS can be implicated in the reduction of REM latency in schizophrenia, the characterization of the neurotransmitter systems involved remains a challenging dilemma.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

In the first part of this review, the relationship between sleep and anxiety is discussed in terms of adaptive response to stress. Recent studies suggested that the corticotropin-releasing hormone system and the locus ceruleus-autonomic nervous system may play major roles in the arousal response to stress. It has been suggested that these systems may be particularly vulnerable to prolonged or repeated stress, further leading to a dysfunctional arousal state and pathological anxiety states, Polysomnographic studies documented limited alteration of sleep in anxiety disorders. There is some indication for alteration in sleep maintenance in generalized anxiety disorder and for both sleep initiation and maintenance in panic disorder; no clear picture emerges for obsessive-compulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder. Finally, an unequivocal sleep architecture profile that could specifically relate to a particular anxiety disorder could not be evidenced; in contrast, conflicting results are often found for the same disorder. Discrepancies between studies could have been related to illness severity, diagnostic comorbidity, and duration of illness. A brief treatment approach for each anxiety disorder is also suggested with a special focus on sleep.",

Defects in cognition, sleep-waking cycles, and psychomotor behavior result.

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of parasomnias occurring in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.Disorders of arousal are characterized by dissociated sleep, with wake and sleep phenomena intermingling, and local sleep, in which different areas of the brain exist simultaneously in different states of wakefulness or sleep. The frequency of arousals from slow-wave sleep with delta or mixed-frequency activity has a high sensitivity but relatively low specificity for the diagnosis of arousal parasomnias.Disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals) are characterized by incomplete awakenings from slow-wave sleep, limited recall of imagery, and partial or complete amnesia. They occur most frequently in childhood. Management includes correction of precipitating factors, attention to safety, behavioral techniques, and medications. Sleep-related eating disorder is a variant of arousal disorders and may be associated with the use of short-acting hypnotics and restless legs syndrome. Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations can occur with visual loss, dementia with Lewy bodies, use of β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and anxiety. Exploding head syndrome occurs at wake-sleep transition or on waking during the night, is usually benign, and requires treatment only if significant sleep disruption occurs.",

Although affected patients may appear to have a neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis or epilepsy, no structural disease process is evident, nor are symptoms deliberately feigned. Instead, brain function is disordered; hence, current preference for the term “functional neurological disorder.” Conversion symptoms exist at the interface between neurology and psychiatry and remain a common cause of disability and distress. The conundrum of hysteria was essential to the development of Freudian psychoanalytic theory, which today is only one of many competing hypotheses to explain these intriguing symptoms.",

The obtained results show that the patients with apnea syndrome sleep very badly, and consequently, shortened sleep latency and frequent body movements, along with apneas, are regarded as the leading polysomnographic symptoms. Vigilance profile during sleep, that is, interchange and frequency of each of sleep stages (I, II, III, IV, REM) are similar in both tested groups. The suppression of restitutive stages of sleep (III, IV, REM) is considered to be a dominant characteristic of vigilance during sleep in obese persons and obese persons with manifest apnea syndrome. Relatively prolonged sleep latency in obese persons without manifest apnea syndrome indicates, however, restitutively higher quality of their nocturnal sleep. Contrary to the patients with apnea syndrome, they do not suffer from excessive evening somnolence, so that their daily alertness and sleep vigilance during night are of a better quality, although the lack of deep and REM sleep is observed in them as well.",

      "abstract": "Pain or sensory symptoms are a frequent complaint in Parkinson disease (PD), which reduce health-related quality of life (QOL) and interfere with patient's ability to participate in activities of daily living, thus contributing to sleep disturbance or major depression. The frequency of pain is thought to have a bimodal distribution. The initial peak seems to occur before, or at the onset of PD and a second peak occurs later in the disease course in conjunction with the development of motor fluctuations or dyskinesia. The spectrum of sensory symptoms is wide, and the most common sites that experience pain are the back, legs, and shoulders. In cases, pain occurs on the side that is more affected by parkinsonism; however unusual distributions, such as oral or genital pain syndrome, chest pain, and upper or lower abdominal discomfort may be observed. The etiological basis of PD-related pain is multifactorial, with varying degrees of contribution from peripheral and central sources. Central mechanisms include derangement of the intrinsic pain-modulating monoaminergic mechanism in addition to plastic central nervous system changes induced by chronic anti-parkinsonian medication. The importance of dopaminergic deficits as a causal factor in PD-related pain is supported by the normalization of these abnormalities after L-dopa administration, which suggests that the human striatum plays a central role in processing nociceptive information. Nevertheless, the lack of response to dopaminergic agents in some patients suggests the involvement of non-dopaminergic structures in PD. Abnormalities of noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways descending to the spinal cord are assumed to play a role in pain perception in PD. Some reports have highlighted the problem of delayed diagnosis in PD patients with an initial presentation of pain. Greater awareness of this possibility among physicians is important. Physicians also should bear in mind that psychological factors are major components of pain and that patient education and support are critical to successful treatment.",

However, infants with colds exhibit some sleep state specific alterations in sleep apnea. At 40, 44, and 48 weeks postconception, the number of respiratory pauses of 2 to 4.9 seconds and of 5 to 9.9 seconds duration per 100 minutes of state, during rapid eye movement, and indeterminate sleep are decreased in infants with colds. The absence of this phenomenon at 52 weeks suggests that it is modified by maturation. We hypothesize that the reduction in rapid eye movement and indeterminate sleep apnea is a manifestation of an adaptive response in normal infants, but for infants at risk for the sudden infant death syndrome, this response may be overwhelmed, resulting in increased apnea and, in some instances, sudden infant death.",

Onset is usually before age 30. The disorder manifests as a myriad of symptoms, including gastrointestinal complaints, various types of pain, cardiopulmonary symptoms, pseudoneurologic complaints, sexual problems and complaints related to the female reproductive system. Vigilance is necessary, because somatization disorder may mimic numerous physical and psychiatric ailments.",

      "abstract": "Ayurveda is based on three principles called Tri (Three) sutra .( 1). Hetu -Causes (cause of health and disease) (2). Linga-Symtoms (Symtoms of health & disease) (3). Aushadh -Medicines (In both roles as preventive & curative). Ayurveda considered sleep as one of the basic instincts of life, a very essential factor for all the living beings. Insomnia is called as Anidra / Nidranasha, an imbalance in Tarpaka Kapha, Sadhaka Pitta and Prana Vayu. Tarpak Kapha is a sub-dosha of Kapha that nourishes the brain cells and facilitates a good night's sleep. Imbalance of this dosha causes poor nourishment of brain cells, leading to Insomnia. Saadhak Pitta is a sub- dosha of Pitta and is located in the heart. It controls emotions, desires, decisiveness, and spirituality. Prana Vayu makes the nervous system sensitive, this sensitive nervous system coupled with an aggravated Prana Vayu lead to insomnia. Habitual sleeplessness or simply inability to sleep for a minimum period, which is necessary for a sound mental and physical health, is called Insomnia (Anidra). (1). Causes for Insomnia (Anidra) :-Vitiated Vata dosha or Pitta Dosha .(Vata-Pitta-Prakop), Mental stress. (Mansik Tanaava). Mental and physical trauma .(Shareerik va Maanashik Aaghaat). Dhatukshaya or Emaciation due to improper diet and diseases. (2). Symptoms of Insomnia (Anidra) :- Yawning, Body ache, Lassitude, Headache, Heaviness in the Head and Eyes , Inactivity, Exhaustion, Giddiness, Indigestion and Diseases caused by Vaata, Unpleasantness, Emaciation, Weakness, Impotency, Ignorance and finally culminating into death. (3). Treatment of Insomnia (Anidra ) :- Avoid caffeinated drinks, alcohol, and aerated drinks after dusk, Avoid watching television or working on the computer late at night, Have a body massage with sesame oil, followed by a bath, Pleasant smell and Sound, Listen to good music and News. Brahami Vati, Sarsatarista, Aswagandharista, Brahami Ghrita, Smritisagar Ras, Brahami Rasayan ,Cap. Brahami ,Tab. Mantate, Cap. Stesscom, Cap. Aswagandha. So it is a demand of time to study about Insomnia and be careful for health and life. By follow some rules to live healthy any one can get a pleasant and healthy life.",

      "abstract": "Chronic musculoskeletal pain is defined as chronic pain arising from musculoskeletal structures such as bones or joints. Although comprising the most prevalent set of chronic pain conditions, it was not represented appropriately in the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which was organized mainly according to anatomical sites, was strongly focused on musculoskeletal disease or local damage, and did not consider the underlying mechanisms of pain. The new ICD-11 classification introduces the concept of chronic primary and secondary musculoskeletal pain, and integrates the biomedical axis with the psychological and social axes that comprise the complex experience of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Chronic primary musculoskeletal pain is a condition in its own right, not better accounted for by a specific classified disease. Chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain is a symptom that arises from an underlying disease classified elsewhere. Such secondary musculoskeletal pain originates in persistent nociception in musculoskeletal structures from local or systemic etiologies, or it may be related to deep somatic lesions. It can be caused by inflammation, by structural changes, or by biomechanical consequences of diseases of the nervous system. It is intended that this new classification will facilitate access to patient-centered multimodal pain management and promote research through more accurate epidemiological analyses.",

The most common sleep disorders in schizophrenia are insomnia, restless leg syndrome (RLS), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), hypersomnia, parasomnia and circadian rhythm disorders. The relevance of insomnia should be emphasized, as it can be a prodromal signof schizophrenia, as well as an alarm sign of an incipient psychotic decompensation. Additionally, the clinical recovery of a psychotic process is usually correlated with sleep normalization. Multiple polysomnographic disturbances on sleep architecture have been found in patients with schizophrenia, including increased sleep latency, awakenings during sleep, sleep-wake cycle inversion, as well as poor sleep efficiency. These objective disturbances have been correlated to subjective poor sleep quality and other main clinical symptoms in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Mental trauma can be caused by single or multiple traumatic events during lifetime or by long-lasting psychological and/or psychosocial stress. Especially chronic stress is a major burden of modern life and poses a clear risk factor for a plethora of somatic and psychiatric disorders. A role of the immune system in the development of stress-associated somatic and psychiatric disorders is very likely, given that: i) both stress-associated somatic and mental disorders go along with a dysregulated and over-reacting immune system; ii) risk factors for mental disorders promote immune hyper-reactivity to psychosocial stress and iii) chronic psychosocial stress induces chronic low-grade inflammation in healthy individuals. Because bone and especially bone regeneration are highly influenced by osteoimmunological mechanisms, we hypothesized that chronic stress and mental health problems might be associated with disturbances in bone homeostasis and healing. We investigated that in various preclinical models for chronic psychosocial stress during pregnancy, childhood or during adulthood. We found that stress during pregnancy induced an osteopenic bone phenotype in male offspring only, while early life stress induced a mild osteocatabolic phenotype in female mice only. In contrast, chronic adult stress did not affect the bones of female mice, while male mice displayed reduced long bone length and disturbed endochondral ossification. Because endochondral ossification is also important for secondary fracture healing, we investigated the effects of chronic adult stress on bone regeneration in male mice. Indeed, we found a disturbed inflammatory response towards fracture with increased number of catecholamine-producing neutrophils in the fracture hematoma. This led to reduced endochondral ossification and thereby contributing to disturbed bone regeneration. In conclusion, we could show that chronic stress during various phases of life might affect bone health in a sex-dependent manner and might also interfere with bone regeneration. Molecular mechanisms might be a dysregulated immune system and thereby osteoimmunological crosstalks.",

Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

      "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by dream-enacting behaviors and unpleasant dreams, and presents a risk for self-injury and harm to others due to abnormal REM sleep during which control of muscle tonus is lacking (REM sleep without atonia) (Schenck et al., 1986; Schenck et al., 2002; American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2005). RBD is a heterogeneous disease entity consisting of a variety of manifestations (Schenck et al., 2002; Gagnon et al. 2006; Postuma et al., 2006, 2009; Maetzler et al., 2009). Idiopathic RBD (iRBD), which develops in middle age or later and progresses chronically, in particular is a common clinical manifestation of Lewy body-related syndrome and is regarded as a clinical entity from pathological aspects. For example (Table 1), it has been elucidated that iRBD is often accompanied by soft motor signs, olfactory and color identification deficits, decreased cardiovascular and respiratory changes between REM and Non-REM sleep, reduced cardiac 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) uptake, impairment of visual memory and visuo-spatial construction revealed by neuropsychological testing, EEG slowing during wakefulness or sleep, and decreased strial dopaminergic innervation and reduced pre-synaptic strial dopamine transporter binding on SPECT or positron emission topography (PET) scans, which are considered as non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Becker et al., 2002; Gagnon et al., 2006; Miyamoto et al., 2006; Miyamoto et al., 2008). Furthermore, despite the limited number of pathological reports on iRBD, the characteristics of iRBD have been supported to have a close relationship with Lewy body pathology (Boeve et al., 2007). Therefore, additional clinical features that could distinguish iRBD with Lewy body-related alpha-synucleinopathies from iRBD due to other causes would be helpful in clinical practice.",

Tal es el caso de la aparicion de periodos de somnolencia durante las jornadas laborales, lo cual se ha convertido en una causa importante de accidentes automovilisticos, industriales y medicos. La somnolencia es causada por el ritmo circadiano y la privacion del sueno, es un estado fisiologico donde el tiempo de respuesta es mas lento que los niveles normales, los principales sintomas de somnolencia son la falta de capacidad de concentracion, atencion, vigilancia y dificultades para mantenerse despierto (Abbood, et al., 2014). En esta tesis se presenta el desarrollo de un sistema de asistencia no intrusivo para la deteccion de somnolencia en tiempo real, que alerta al usuario si es necesario, con el objetivo de reducir el numero de accidentes causados por somnolencia. El dispositivo desarrollado esta basado en el monitoreo de ritmo cardiaco debido a que el sistema nervioso autonomo afecta el latido del corazon de una persona con somnolencia (Bader, 2002). En este proyecto se realizaron estudios aplicando la metodologia seis sigma para el desarrollo de productos, basandose en una muestra de 20 usuarios, monitoreando su ritmo cardiaco a lo largo de sus actividades diarias para determinar sus rangos de vigilia y sueno, posteriormente se realizaron pruebas con un simulador de manejo activando un sistema de asistencia cuando su estado de alerta disminuia drasticamente. Como sistema de asistencia se incorporo una alarma sonora para recuperar el estado de alerta del usuario, debido a los efectos del sonido en las primeras etapas del sueno. Se identificaron variaciones importantes en el ritmo cardiaco que pueden ser utilizadas para la estandarizacion del monitoreo de somnolencia, manteniendo la medicion del estado de alerta, sin importar los rangos de ritmo cardiaco de cada persona.",

Rather, these sleep complaints are often secondary to medical and psychiatric illness, the medications used to treat these illnesses, circadian rhythm changes, or other sleep disorders.

When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Disruptions of circadian and biological rhythms as well as general anesthesia can induce sleep disorders, resulting in an increase in sleepiness and drowsiness and a decrease in vigilance. It has been previously shown that circadian time can influence the pharmacologic sensitivity and the duration of action of general anesthetics. Studies on interactions between general anesthesia and circadian rhythms are few, but all of them suggest an important role of general anesthetics on circadian rhythms. General anesthesia is a particular wake-sleep state that could potentially alter circadian rhythms on the days following anesthesia. The aim of this review is to discuss the various effects of general anesthesia on animal and human circadian time structure. This topic is highly relevant to clinicians, especially those involved in that field of ambulatory practice responsible for post-operative patient care, including patient recovery and fatigue.",

This paper posits that physiologically, sleep bruxism is an autonomic self-regulatory response to nighttime occurrences of tachycardia stemming from the brain experiencing microarousals during sleep. Sleep bruxism by triggering the trigeminal cardiac reflex leads to bradycardia. Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity-sleep bruxism, thereby, serves to slow the heart rate when brain microarousals cause tachycardia.",

      "abstract": "Subjective sleepiness is defined as \"an elemental feeling state\" by which the subject, and only him/her knows whether he/she is alert or sleepy. Subjective sleepiness has little been used for the clinical evaluation of sleepiness. Objective sleepiness is defined as a consequence of the homeostatic need for sleep. In the absence of a measurable marker of the fulfillment of the function of sleep, the evaluation of objective sleepiness has to rely on a behavioral approach based on the postulate that the more you need sleep (i.e., the sleepier you are), the more likely you are to fall asleep. However, as for many other fundamental human behaviors (drinking, eating, sexual behavior), it is likely that the sleeping behavior serves other purposes than its primary objective, which distorts the relationship between the observed sleeping behavior and the actual need for sleep. The likelihood to fall asleep can be measured by the speed with which a sleep episode occurs under standardized laboratory conditions (multiple sleep latency test, maintenance of wakefulness test, OSLER test), or by the frequency of unwanted sleep episodes under the more naturalistic conditions of daily life (Epworth Sleepiness Scale). These various approaches have advantages and drawbacks, but none of them can be considered the \"gold standard\".",

It is easy to imagine that physical changes in brain state can produce psychosis, but also that the perfectly normal changes of sleep have very dramatic effects on our mental capacities. Psychosis is, by definition, a mental state characterised by hallucinations and/or delusions and dreaming is most like the organic mental illness delirium. Sleep loss is common in and contributes powerfully to the development of psychosis.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by dream enactment and complex motor behaviors during rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep atonia loss (rapid eye movement sleep without atonia) during polysomnography. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder may be idiopathic or symptomatic and in both settings is highly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegeneration, especially Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder frequently manifests years to decades prior to overt motor, cognitive, or autonomic impairments as the presenting manifestation of synucleinopathy, along with other subtler prodromal “soft” signs of hyposmia, constipation, and orthostatic hypotension. Between 35% and 91.9% of patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder at a sleep center later develop a defined neurodegenerative disease. Less is known about the long‐term prognosis of community‐dwelling younger patients, especially women, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder associated with antidepressant medications. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are frequently prone to sleep‐related injuries and should be treated to prevent injury with either melatonin 3‐12 mg or clonazepam 0.5‐2.0 mg to limit injury potential. Further evidence‐based studies about rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are greatly needed, both to enable accurate prognostic prediction of end synucleinopathy phenotypes for individual patients and to support the application of symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder as a prodromal synucleinopathy represents a defined time point at which neuroprotective therapies could potentially be applied for the prevention of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "The syndrome is generally defined as a group of symptoms or signs that regulary occur\r\n together. Cauda equina syndrome (CES) affetcs a group of root nerves called Cauda equina\r\n (lat. Pony tail). These nerves are located at the lower end of the spine in the lumbosacral part\r\n of the body. They send and also receive messages for pelvis, legs and feet. Trauma, excessive\r\n strains, violent injuries and some deseases and conditions ( hernation of the disc) can result\r\n with compression of the root of this nerve. There is severe pain in the lower part of the back,\r\n loss or change of sensation in the legs, buttocks and can also result with difficulty in\r\n urinating. Surgical treatment must be performed quickly to prevent permanent damage such\r\n as leg paralysis, bladder and bowel dysfuncion, sexual function or other problems.\r\n This syndrome has a significant effect on people – physically and emotionally, especially if it\r\n is chronic. Often, people with CES may no longer go to work because of the severe problems\r\n with pain, social problems, weaknes in motor and sensor skills that can be fully or partialy\r\n lost. Loss of bladder and bowel control can be extremly disturbing and has a very negative\r\n impact on social life, work and relationships. Nurse interventions should be geared towards\r\n providing supportive, emotional support with education about the syndrome and how to\r\n improve the quality of life, reduce pain; also in interventions they should oberve such patients\r\n and assist with the implementation of the activities.\r\n CES occurs more often in adults then in children. Men are more likely to be ill from this\r\n syndrome than women. Middle age is also a significant risk factor as this age population is\r\n more likely to develop problems with herniated disc.",

      "abstract": "In deze casusbeschrijving wordt het belang van goede slaap beschreven bij een jonge man met een stoornis in het autistisch spectrum die door vermoeidheid en concentratieproblemen meerdere mbo-opleidingen moest stoppen. Bij personen met een autismespectrumstoornis (ASS) zien we meer problemen met in- en doorslapen (insomnie) en meer circadiane ritmestoornissen dan onder de algemene bevolking. Beide slaapstoornissen zijn effectief te behandelen. De casus illustreert dat het bij mensen met een stoornis in het autistisch spectrum met slaap- en vermoeidheidsklachten belangrijk is om onderscheid te maken tussen verstoorde slaap en vermoeidheid. Vermoeidheid kan ontstaan zowel vanuit overprikkeling of slecht slapen als een combinatie zijn van beide. Het is dan ook belangrijk om beide punten in ogenschouw te nemen. Wat betreft de prikkelverwerking zijn voldoende rustmomenten overdag en het tot rust komen voor bedtijd door middel van het afbouwen van de dag van groot belang. Dit bereik je onder andere door het verminderen van prikkels anderhalf uur voor bedtijd. Valkuilen hierbij zijn bij jongvolwassenen dwangmatig gedrag, zoals gamen. Wat betreft het verbeteren van de slaapproblemen is het verder van belang om de tijd in bed te beperken tot de benodigde individuele slaapbehoefte. In de praktijk blijkt dat personen met ASS goed in staat zijn om de gedragsmatige adviezen om slaapkwaliteit te bevorderen toe te passen. Zij ondervinden er veel steun aan. Het merendeel van de adviezen (rust, reinheid en regelmaat) creeert een mate van voorspelbaarheid en hierdoor rust in de dag. Na behandeling van de slaapstoornissen neemt de vermoeidheid af waardoor symptomen van autisme (onder andere prikkelgevoeligheid) beter gehanteerd kunnen worden. Ook nemen concentratieproblemen af waardoor het algehele functioneren verbetert.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is a condition when a person has a sudden neurological deficit caused by a disruption in the blood vessels of the brain. About 21-77% of stroke patients have sleep disorders that occur after a stroke. The sleep cycle is regulated by the brain and strokes can cause sleep disturbances due to abnormalities that can occur in the brain structures that regulate sleep. Post Stroke Sleep Disoder (PSSD) is the most common symptom after stroke. Sleep disorders after stroke include Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disturbance, hypersomnia, parasomnia and sleep-related movement disorders. Sleep has many benefits, one of which is the restoration of physical and mental functions, the consolidation of memory and improving the learning ability of a person both motorically and sensitively. Other studies have also shown a correlation between electrographic sleep time and cognitive function of stroke patients during recovery. Another experimental study also indicated that sleep disorders can increase the expression of neurocans, which are genes that inhibit nerve growth. Sleep disorders in stroke patients can reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of stroke rehabilitation",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review This review aimed to comprehensively outline sleep and circadian rhythm abnormalities in hyperkinetic movement disorders beyond Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms, including tremor, dystonia, choreiform movements, tics, and ataxia disorders. Recent findings Insomnia, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are commonly reported in essential tremor, Wilson's disease, tics or Tourette's syndrome, and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) have been observed in Wilson's disease and SCA. A combination of REM and non-REM parasomnias, along with nocturnal stridor with the initiation of sleep and re-entering after awakening, are characterized by undifferentiated Non-REM and poorly structured N2 in anti-IgLON5 disease. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has been reported commonly in SCAs. Sleep-related dyskinesia has been reported in ADCY5-related disease and GNAO1-related movement disorder. Summary Sleep problems can manifest as a result of movement disorders, either through direct motor disturbances or secondary nonmotor symptoms. Medication effects must be considered, as certain medications for movement disorders can exacerbate or alleviate sleep disturbances. Distinguishing sleep problems in some diseases might involve pathognomonic symptoms and signs, aiding in the diagnosis of movement disorders.",

The physical challenges of living with a vascular malformation will affect the patient's psychological health, and psychological factors will affect the patient's experience of their physical health. Psychological difficulties are typically the result of a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors. As such, having a vascular malformation will not result in the same psychological outcomes for each young person. Having a new healthy baby is a known stressor that can precipitate a range of stress-related reactions in parents, including major mental health difficulties. When a child has physical health differences, the stress can increase as a result of uncertainty about the infant's health and development and the extra health care burden of hospital attendances and daily management at home.",

These symptoms include: cortical activation (though the activation of different cortical areas, mainly the limbic cortex), phasic periods of motor arousal (rapid eye movements, muscle contractions) and activation of the sympathetic nervous system leading to increased blood pressure and heart rate. Muscle atony and lack of consciousness are the main REM sleep manifestations, which distinguish PS from wakefulness. Regulation of particular components of REM sleep requires cooperation of different neurotransmitter systems and numerous brain structures, which all comprise the PS generating system.",

      "abstract": "Couvade is the common but poorly understood phenomenon whereby the expectant father experiences somatic symptoms during the pregnancy for which there is no recognized physiological basis. Symptoms commonly include indigestion, increased or decreased appetite, weight gain, diarrhea or constipation, headache, and toothache. Onset is usually during the third gestational month with a secondary rise in the late third trimester. Symptoms generally resolve with childbirth. Couvade has been seen as an expression of somatized anxiety, pseudo-sibling rivalry, identification with the fetus, ambivalence about fatherhood, a statement of paternity, or parturition envy. It is likely that the dynamics of couvade may vary between individuals and may be multidetermined.",

The two types of problems have been linked together and attributed to a general disturbance of infant regulation. Yet the infant behaviours involved present differently, at separate ages and times of day. To clarify causation, this study aims to assess whether prolonged crying at 5-6 weeks (the peak age for crying) predicts which infants are unsettled in the night at 12 weeks of age (when most infants become settled at night).",

The peak of cluster attack occurrence at the equinoxes in spring and autumn coincides with greater leaps in day length, leading to interfere with synchronization of endogenous pacemaker systems.

Most likely only the lighter sleep periods, just after falling asleep, or shortly before awakening, the restless sleep of sickness, are accompanied by vivid dream-fantasies. That such nervous fantasies are especially violent in feverish attacks is a matter of common knowledge. But, quite apart from health, even outer circumstances likely to disturb sleep may affect the child's dream-fantasy by producing terror; of this we have a very plain instance in Hilde.

The insidious, chronic course of most sleep disorders and lack of patient awareness of signs and symptoms during sleep can complicate the clinical evaluation. Typical chief complaints include snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and behaviors during sleep. Sleep disorders can be primary or secondary to medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is often desirable. Family members can be a critical source of information as they may have observed nocturnal or daytime symptoms unrecognized by the patient. Objective testing plays an important role in assessment for obstructive sleep apnea, parasomnias, and other specific sleep disorders, and can be used most effectively in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation. Nonsleep specialists should consider obtaining assistance from sleep clinicians for more challenging presentations or management of sleep disorders unfamiliar to them.",

There has been a lack of clarity regarding the definition of DNS, as many sleep-related symptoms and conditions disrupt sleep quality in narcolepsy (eg, hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, nightmares, restless legs syndrome/periodic leg movements, nocturnal eating, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety). In addition, the intrinsic sleep instability of narcolepsy results in frequent spontaneous wakings and sleep stage transitions, contributing to DNS. Sleep instability likely emerges in the setting of orexin insufficiency/deficiency, but its exact pathophysiology remains unknown. DNS impairs quality of life among people with narcolepsy, and more research is needed to determine its contributions to cardiovascular risk. Multimodal treatment is appropriate for DNS management, including behavioral therapies, counseling on sleep hygiene, and/or medication. There is strong evidence showing improvement in self-reported sleep quality and objective sleep stability measures with sodium oxybate, but rigorous clinical trials with other pharmacotherapies are needed. Treatment may be complicated by comorbidities, concomitant medications, and mood disorders.DNS is a common symptom of narcolepsy deserving consideration in clinical care and future research.Maski K, Mignot E, Plazzi G, Dauvilliers Y.

      "abstract": "Frecuentemente las personas economicamente activas se someten diariamente a un estres laboral, en especial las que prestan servicios asistenciales. Este estres puede provocar un conjunto de respuestas inadecuadas como agotamiento emocional y/o actitudes negativas hacia las personas con las que el individuo interacciona en su ambiente laboral. Cuando estos sintomas llegan a ser cronicos se presenta el denominado “Sindrome de Desgaste Profesional” (SDP); el cual se caracteriza por tres dimensiones interrelacionadas: cansancio emocional (AE), despersonalizacion (DP) y falta de realizacion personal (FRP). El estudio de este sindrome en el campo de la docencia juega un papel muy importante ya que los individuos que ejercen esta profesion constantemente, estan sometidos a una gran diversidad de factores estresantes que generan deficiencias en su calidad de vida e incluso puede llegar a repercutir en la calidad de la educacion en el pais.Por tal motivo el objetivo de esta investigacion fue establecer las diferencias y semejanzas del SDP en los profesores de dos escuelas a nivel universitario: El Instituto Tecnologico de Orizaba (I.T.O.) y la Escuela Nacional de Medicina y Homeopatia (E.N.M.yH.) en el ano 2008. Para el desarrollo de este trabajo se selecciono de manera aleatoria una muestra representativa de 40 docentes a los cuales se aplicaron dos herramientas: El “Maslach Burnout Inventory” (MBI), en su version validada al espanol y un cuestionario sociodemografico, los cuales detectan y determinan el grado de SDP ademas de identificar las principales variables o condiciones que favorecen el desarrollo de este sindrome. Es importante mencionar que las encuestas realizadas fueron contestadas anonimamente y que se colecto el 100% de ellas.\r\nEn base a los resultados el diagnostico global se muestra la existencia del SDP en un nivel bajo.Sin embargo, los profesores del I.T.O. son mas vulnerables a padecer SDP que los profesores que laboran en la E.N.M.yH.; en cuanto a las variables sociodemograficas que mas repercuten en los profesores de ambas instituciones son: el estar casado, la escolaridad y el contar con una base laboral.",

This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is a discomfort and a kind of fear feeling of which individuals do not know the reasons but feel against the events which they regard dangerous and threatening. The indicator of anxiety in behaviors is a switch from the state of excessive excitement and activeness to sluggishness. Fear, nervousness, excessive anger, disgust, tiredness, muscle aches and psychological complaints are the most common indicators of the anxiety. “State anxiety” is permanent emotional reactions which the individual shows to the permanent states of which the density changes according to the conditions. “The state anxiety” level is high in the conditions which the individual comprehends the stressing state as threatening and it is low in the conditions which the danger is not comprehended as threatening. “State Anxiety” affects the sportsman’s motivation, concentration, coordination, the ability to determine, self-confidence, kondisyonel and coordinative abilities, which may be determinative on his/her performance. “State Anxiety” , which is occurred before or during the events that are called dangerous, is generally based on logical reasons and can be understood by other people. Trait anxiety is the perceiving the situations causing stress as a dangerous or threatening and the increasing and gaining continuity of the frequency and the density of emotional reactions against these threats. Trait anxiety is common and continuous anxiety which does not depend on a certain event or situation.. As the aim in sports competitions is based on probability of winning and losing, desire to have a good performance to be able to win sometimes creates negative impacts, and increasing complex emotions bring about the bad performance. Sports psychologists have consensus that it is necessary for the athletes to have a certain anxiety level for high performance. Lower or higher level affects the performance negatively. High anxiety level for the athletes is generally attained as the athletes come close to the borders of performance capacity. In other words, while coming close to the borders of performance capacity, anxiety density is increasing. If the athletes’ emotions are on the level of enthusiasm, horror or anger, many mental functions particularly thinking and perceiving get weak, and it is not possible to carry out activities consciously. To reach psycho-physic balance condition that a sportsman has, it is necessary to abolish the emotions. On the other hand, it is a big mistake to go on keeping the player on the game and expect a result. The physiological reactions which are shown by the people coming into anxiety process show themselves in the situations as difficulty in breathing, arthralgia, fatigue, headache, angriness, insomnia, anorexia or belly, smoking and using alcohol more, shirking his/her duty, ambivalence, amnesia, impatience, imbalance, having nightmare, gastric, infarction risk.

      "abstract": "For this paper, psychophysiological relationships between stress and sleep are considered with reference to clinical psychiatric problems. Answers to the first question--how does sleep affect the tolerance of stress in the waking state?--are provided by sleep deprivation experiments. The latter show that total sleep deprivation has a great influence on stress. However gradual partial sleep deprivation to a sleep time of 5 hours seems well tolerated by most individuals. In some special cases we found subjects well adapted to the workaday world who could live with briefer sleeping periods. Because of experimental problems, the second question--how does stress affect sleep?--is more difficult to answer. Anxiety is one of the most important factors deteriorating sleep under conditions of stress. This reduced sleep is in turn stressful for waking behavior. Thus, the relationship between stress and sleep, two factors separated for scientific investigation, is essential and especially important in the problem of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "A 59-year-old man with temporomandibular joint pain/dysfunction syndrome presented with a long history of nocturnal bruxism. All-night polysomnographic recordings with video monitoring showed episodes of teeth grinding or clenching occurring exclusively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which were often associated with movements of the hands and fingers and/or brief vocalization. Throughout REM sleep, there was excessive phasic chin electromyographic twitching, without increased tone, and also excessive phasic electromyographic twitching in multiple muscle sites. The patient maintained a normal nonrapid eye movement-REM cycle, but showed increased REM density. Polysomnographic characteristics suggested that there may be a common pathophysiology in a certain type of sleep bruxism and the REM sleep behavior disorder. Sleep bruxism seen in this case is concluded to be a manifestation of subclinical REM sleep behavior disorder.",

      "abstract": "markdownabstractAcross the world, people continue to live longer, resulting in increasing numbers of older people. Age-related functional deficiencies, such as problems in gait and daily functioning, will therefore become a major issue for society. People with problems in gait and daily functioning are at high risk to lose independence, which will eventually lead to institutionalization. Furthermore, poor gait and daily functioning are strong risk factors of various morbidities, such as falling, and even death. \r\nHowever, little remains known on the underlying processes leading to problems in gait and daily functioning. Both gait and daily functioning are complex processes, requiring integration of input from various systems, such as the proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual system. The nervous system has a central role in this integration, with the peripheral nervous system conducting the information, which is subsequently processed by the brain. \r\nDeficiencies of the nervous system, particularly the brain, may therefore have a large impact on gait and daily functioning. With aging and various neurological diseases, such as dementia and Parkinson’s disease, pathology accumulates in the brain. Brain pathology may be visualized as structural brain changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and as microstructural brain changes with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Both structural and microstructural brain changes are known to strongly affect brain functioning, as measured by cognition. However, much less is known on how this loss of brain functioning affects gait and daily functioning.",

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

      "abstract": "Seizures and epilepsy commonly occur in patients with organ system failure, either as a consequence of trophic effects on cerebral function or of therapies used in such conditions. Acute organ failure results in an abrupt, but often reversible, lowering of seizure threshold, whereas chronic organ failure results in more pervasive and indolent cerebral compromise, often permanently altering both the seizure threshold and the physiologic responses to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Failure of an organ system is not typically a sudden, all-or-none phenomenon but occurs in stages with variable susceptibility to seizures as the condition worsens or remits. Although the principles of diagnosis and management of seizures in adult and pediatric patients with a specific organ dysfunction are similar, the underlying etiologies and influences of comorbid conditions differ between adults and children. Adult organ failure often involves multiple systems to different extents and is superimposed on other chronic diseases of adulthood. Pediatric organ failure is usually the result of inherited metabolic disorders, infections, and unique pediatric susceptibilities to metabolic effects of medications (Table 1).",

This endogenous clock naturally runs more slowly than the solar day and is entrained to a 24-h rhythm primarily by the alternation of light and darkness. Jet lag, shift-work sleep disorder, and some of the chronic insomnias are caused by a temporal discrepancy of the body clock relative to the surrounding environment and social network. The underlying mechanisms and general management are described. Both bright light and melatonin therapy have potential in the management of these disorders. Traditionally, bright light therapy has been used to alleviate the depression associated with seasonal affective disorder. Melatonin has received much ill-formed publicity, it being claimed that it is a panacea and an ‘antiageing’ treatment. Both of these treatment approaches are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of death in most developed countries and some developing countries including South Korea. It is well known that stroke has is related in some way with several sleep disorders. At first, the onset time of stroke varies according to circadian rhythm. Early morning is the most prevalent time and late evening the least. The changes of blood pressure, catecholamine level, plasminogen activity and aggregation of platelet during sleep have been suggested as possible mechanisms. Sleep apnea (SA), a representative disorder in the field of sleep medicine, is found in more than 70% of acute stroke patients compared to 2-5% of the general population. Various sleep related breathing disorders occur after stroke and snoring is a distinct risk factor for stroke. So the relationship between stroke and SA is obvious, but the cause and effect are still not clearly known. Also, stroke may cause many sleep related problems such as insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia and changes in sleep architecture. Patients, family members and even medical personnel often ignore stroke-related sleep problems, being concerned only about the stroke itself. The clinical impacts of sleep problems in stroke patients may be significant not only in terms of quality of life but also as a risk factor or prognostic factor for stroke. More attention should be paid to the sleep problems of stroke patients.",

A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

      "title": "Hipersonolência diurna e variáveis polissonográficas em doentes com síndroma de apneia do sono",
      "abstract": "A síndroma de apneia obstrutiva do sono (SAOS) caracteriza-se por episódios repetidos de obstrução da via aérea superior, hipoxemia nocturna e fragmentação do sono. A hipersonolência diurna constitui um sintoma frequente nos doentes com esta síndroma, embora possa estar ausente. A sua presença representa uma limitação significativa da qualidade de vida do indivíduo, bem como um aumento da morbilidade e mortalidade da SAOS, visto ser um importante factor de risco para acidentes de viação e laborais, podendo originar alterações cognitivo-comportamentais relevantes. O mecanismo desencadeante de hipersonolência diurna não é claro. Alguns autores relacionaram esta com a arquitectura anormal do sono, o que, no entanto, não foi confirmado por outros investigadores. Alguns estudos salientaram a relação entre a hipersonolência diurna e os níveis de dessaturação nocturna da oxi-hemoglobina, mas este facto não foi comprovado cientificamente. O objectivo do presente trabalho foi analisar quais os mecanismos responsáveis pela sonolência diurna nos doentes com SAOS. Assim, numerosas variáveis registadas no estudo polissonográfico foram compara das em dois grupos de indivíduos com esta patologia, apresentando um deles hipersonolência diurna inequívoca e o outro a total ausência da mesma. Foram avaliados 65 indivíduos seguidos no Departamento Respiratório do Hospital Universitário do Son Dureta (Palma de Maiorca) que possuíam no registo poligráfico nocturno um índice de apneia/hipopneia (IAH) > 20/h. A sonolência excessiva foi determinada utilizando a escala de sono de Epworth (ESE) e o teste de latência múltipla. A sua presença foi considerada sempre que o score de ESE > 10 e o score do teste de latência múltipla < 5 min. A ausência da mesma era determinada por um score de ESE < 10 e um teste de latência > 10 min. Cerca de 25 indivíduos foram excluídos devido a discrepância entre os resultados das referidas determinações. Dos 40 doentes restantes, 23 apresentavam hipersonolência diurna e 17 não. Nenhum dos indivíduos sofria de doença crónica, nomeadamente DPOC, cirrose hepática, disfunção tiroideia, artrite reumatóide, insuficiência renal crónica ou fazia qualquer tipo de medicação. O diagnóstico de SAOS foi estabelecido por polissonografia nocturna com registo de múltiplas variáveis, como sejam electroencefalograma (EEG), electromiograma (EMG) mentoniano, electrooculograma, fluxo oronasal, movimentos toracoabdominais e oximetria de fluxo. Apneia foi definida como a interrupção de fluxo oronasal > 10s e hipopneia como uma redução > 50% do fluxo por um período > 10s associado a uma descida > 4% da SaO2 ou despertar. O índice de apneia/hipopneia (IAH) consiste no somatório do número de apneias e hipopneias por hora de sono. Os estádios do sono foram classificados de acordo com os critérios de Rechtschoffen e Kales. A latência do sono foi definida como o período compreendido entre o acto de deitar e os primeiros 30s do estádio I e a eficiência do sono como a duração do sono nocturno expressa como percentagem do tempo total de permanência no leito. De acordo com os critérios da American Sleep Disorders Association Task Force, os despertares foram definidos como despertares de origem respiratória quando ocorriam 3 s após uma apneia, hipopneia ou ressonar, sabendo que existem outros tipos de despertares (espontâneos, relacionados com os movimentos periódicos dos membros e técnicos). O total de despertares foi determinado pela soma de cada tipo dos mesmos. A hipersonolência subjectiva foi avaliada utilizando a ESE constituída por 8 itens a que são atribuídos um score de 0 a 3. A avaliação objectiva é obtida através do teste de latência múltipla de acordo com as guidelines internacionais. Um score < 5 min traduz hipersonolência diurna e > 10 min a sua ausência. Foram estudados, no total, 23 indivíduos do sexo masculino com hipersonolência diurna (ESE: 17 ± 3; teste latência múltipla: 4 ± 1 min) e 17 sem sonolência excessiva (ESE: 5 ± 2 e teste latência: 16 ± 3 min). Ambos os grupos presentaram um IAH similar (62 ± 18/h versus 60 ± 20/h). Os doentes com hipersonolência possuíam um tempo de latência inferior (11 ± 16 versus 18 ± 18 min) e uma maior eficiência do sono (90 ± 7 versus 82 ± 13%) do que os indivíduos sem sonolência excessiva. Os primeiros apresentavam uma menor oxigenação (Sat O2 mínima 69 ± 12 versus 79 ± 8%; Sat O2 média 87 ± 6 versus 90 ± 5%). A distribuição dos estádios do sono e o índice de despertar não diferiu entre os grupos. Verificou-se, assim, que doentes com SAOS e sonolência diurna excessiva se caracterizavam por um tempo de latência do sono inferior, uma maior eficiência do sono e uma oxigenação nocturna pior em relação aos indivíduos sem hipersonolência diurna. A hipoxemia nocturna parece ser o factor determinante major da hipersonolência diurna dos doentes com SAOS.",

      "title": "Sleep Deprivation and Depression: A bi-directional association.",
      "abstract": "In this issue of SQUMJ, Al-Maddah et al. reported a significant association between sleep deprivation among medical trainees and depressive indices using the Beck Depression Inventory-2.1 Using a cross-sectional study design, the authors found that depressive symptoms were more profound with acute rather than chronic sleep deprivation. They attributed the emerging depressive symptoms among medical residents to the acute lack of sleep because of long working hours, but not to the number of on-call nights per week.1 However, there was no follow-up to ascertain the cause-and-effect relationship between chronic sleep deprivation and depressive indices.\r\n\r\nSleep occupies about a third of our lives and is vital to fulfil physiological needs, particularly in terms of cognitive function and mood. Disrupted sleep is very distressing for most individuals and may have a negative impact on their quality of life. Sleep deprivation has been shown to alter performance among medical professionals and shift workers, with several studies addressing its association with depressive symptoms.2–4 Residents and medical interns often suffer from reduced sleep which may lead to neurobehavioural impairment. Rosen et al. reported that medical interns with chronic sleep deprivation displayed high levels of depression and burnout over a period of one working year.5 In another study, Papp et al. found that chronic sleep loss had a negative impact on residents’ personal lives and their ability to perform their work.6 This supports the idea that chronic rather than acute sleep deprivation may result in depression, contrary to the findings of Al-Maddah et al.1\r\n\r\nNight shift work is a well-known cause of daytime sleepiness and mood disorders among workers. These results might also be attributable to chronic sleep loss and changes in circadian rhythm.7 However, one night of fragmented sleep was shown to cause normal subjects to feel sleepier during the day, impair subjective assessments of their mood and decrease mental flexibility and sustained attention.8 Therefore, clinical depression might result from the accumulative effect of chronic sleep fragmentation, deprivation and disturbance.8\r\n\r\nThere is a strong bi-directional relationship between sleep deprivation/disturbance and depression. Although disturbed sleep is associated with psychiatric disorders and is traditionally considered to be a symptom of depression,9 research suggests that the relationship between sleep changes and mood disorders may work in the other direction as well.10 In addition to being a symptom, disrupted or a lack of sleep may also be a causal factor that contributes to the development of mood disorders.10,11 Chronic insomnia was found to increase the odds ratio of developing depression in several longitudinal studies.9,12 Alterations in sleep patterns are associated with depression, a fact which has been reported in the literature for over three decades.11,12 Additionally, certain sleep breathing disorders have a strong association with depression. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is significantly associated with an impairment in cognitive function due to sleep disturbance and subsequent daytime sleepiness.13 Peppard et al. found a dose-response association between sleep-related breathing disorders and depression.14 This finding might be attributed to frequent awakening due to the sleep apnoea, in addition to repeated hypoxic stress to the brain as a result of desaturation.14\r\n\r\nContrarily, acute sleep deprivation has been long reported to be beneficial in treating depression. An early study revealed that a single night of sleep deprivation had an antidepressive effect.15 Therapeutic sleep deprivation was performed either as total sleep deprivation or with selective non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation.16,17 The efficacy of either method has not yet been well investigated, although the impression received suggests that total sleep deprivation is superior to the selective technique.15 Nonetheless, therapeutic sleep deprivation is not free of side-effects. Depressed individuals may experience increases in impulsiveness and drive.17 In addition, they would also suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness, which might be difficult to distinguish, especially in non-responders, with a worsening of the depressive symptoms.17\r\n\r\nTwo processes mainly regulate sleep. Firstly, the circadian process regulates the daily rhythms of the body and brain.18 The circadian pacemaker is found in a group of cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus.18,19 These cells provide an oscillatory pattern of activity that drives rhythms such as sleep-wake activity and endocrine secretions. They are markedly affected by light and darkness and, to some extent, by temperature.19 Bright light in the evening will delay the ‘clock’ and bright light in the morning is necessary to synchronise individuals to a 24-hour rhythm. All animals have a form of this process and the specific period and timing appear to be dependent on particular genes, which are similar in fruit flies and mammals.20\r\n\r\nThere is strong evidence to support the role of the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythm in the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders, particularly depression.18 Melatonin, a peptide synthesised by the pineal gland, has been shown to play a role in the modulation of the circadian rhythm.21 Disrupted melatonin secretion and abnormal circadian rhythms have been reported among depressed subjects and the elderly; this could be the cause of sleep-phase shifts and consequent daytime sleepiness among these groups.22,23 As part of the circadian clock, the drive to sleep in normal sleepers slowly begins to increase a few hours after sunset and gradually reaches a peak in the early morning. The timing of REM sleep is linked to the circadian rhythm, closely mirroring the core temperature of the body. Thus, the maximum propensity for REM sleep is usually in the second half of the night with the onset of slow-wave sleep at the beginning of the night.24,25 The occurrence of REM sleep during daytime naps indicates a pathological daytime sleepiness, as can be observed in cases of narcolepsy.24\r\n\r\nSecondly, the homeostatic process is the other important regulatory factor for sleep. It increases via sleep deprivation and peaks 16 hours after morning awakening and then decreases again during sleep. When there is a lack of sleep or the duration of sleep is shorter than usual, there is an increase in the homeostatic process. Consequently, this works to ensure that the sleep deprivation is made up for during the next sleep period, by accelerating the time before sleep and by possibly increasing sleep depth and duration.25\r\n\r\nIn animal models, chronic sleep restriction for more than a week was shown to lead to alterations in the neurotransmitter receptor systems (serotonin-1A receptor and corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor systems) and neuroendocrine stress systems (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis).26 These changes are similar to those reported for major depression. The link between sleep and depression occurs through the serotoninergic system, which is active during wakefulness and inactive during sleep. Serotonin release is very much inhibited during slow-wave and REM sleep.22 Endogenous depression is associated with the functional impairment of several neurotransmitter systems, particularly monaminergic neurotransmission. Likewise, evidence of decreased serotoninergic activity was observed in the brains of depressed patients.27\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, chronic sleep deprivation rather than acute sleep loss may lead to depression that is potentially attributable to the neurochemical changes that occur in the brain. On the other hand, depression may lead to disturbed sleep which could manifest as a symptom of a mood disorder. Short sleep duration has been shown to be increasing in prevalence worldwide with a concurrent increase in depressive symptoms, mainly among the younger population.28 Further epidemiological studies are required to ascertain the prevalence of such an association among the local population in Oman.",

      "title": "Acupuncture treatment for Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder that makes it difficult to fall asleep, stay asleep, or return to sleep after waking up too early. As a result, a person may wake up feeling unrefreshed and fatigued. This condition can lower the energy levels and impact ones mood. The amount of sleep needed varies for each person, but most adults require between 7 and 9 hours per night. Many adults experience short-term insomnia at some point, lasting for days or weeks. However, some individuals suffer from long-term insomnia, known as chronic insomnia. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), insomnia is more than just difficulty sleeping—it reflects an imbalance between Yin and Yang, the opposing forces that regulate the body's natural rhythms. Yin, which symbolizes coolness, nourishment, and rest, dominates the night, while Yang, linked to warmth, energy, and alertness, governs the day. When this balance is disrupted, the body has trouble shifting between wakefulness and rest, resulting in sleep disturbances. In this research paper is about eighteen years old girl who suffer from insomnia around 6 months. She is a high school student, and she goes to school in shifts. She uses melatonin as a therapy for this problem, and another health problem she has is an allergy to flowers and grass. When she came to our center for TCM, she slept for 3-5 hours and usually fell asleep in the early morning hours around 5-6 am. So far, he has had a total of 16 acupuncture treatments. The first 9 treatments were done more frequently, every second or third day, and then when the situation improved, she continued with the treatments once a week. After acupuncture treatments, the patient feels better, she sleeps 5-6 hours at night and also sleeps during the day. When she is on the second shift at school, she sleeps up to 8-9 hours at night. Acupuncture is often used as a treatment for insomnia and gives positive results.",

Its effects are mediated by a complex neurobiological system centering in the brain with effectors including autonomic nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammatory system, and gene expression. A stressor pushes the human physiological system away from its baseline state towards a lower utility state. The physiological system may return towards the original state but may be shifted to a lower utility state. While some physiological changes induced by stressors may benefit health, chronic stressors usually have negative effects on health. In contrast to this stressor effect is the system's resilience which influences its ability to return to the high utility attractor basin following a perturbation by increasing the likelihood and/or speed of returning to the baseline state following a stressor.",

      "title": "Gait disorders in adults and the elderly",
      "abstract": "Human gait depends on a complex interplay of major parts of the nervous, musculoskeletal and cardiorespiratory systems. The individual gait pattern is influenced by age, personality, mood and sociocultural factors. The preferred walking speed in older adults is a sensitive marker of general health and survival. Safe walking requires intact cognition and executive control. Gait disorders lead to a loss of personal freedom, falls and injuries and result in a marked reduction in the quality of life. Acute onset of a gait disorder may indicate a cerebrovascular or other acute lesion in the nervous system but also systemic diseases or adverse effects of medication, in particular polypharmacy including sedatives. The prevalence of gait disorders increases from 10 % in people aged 60–69 years to more than 60 % in community dwelling subjects aged over 80 years. Sensory ataxia due to polyneuropathy, parkinsonism and frontal gait disorders due to subcortical vascular encephalopathy or disorders associated with dementia are among the most common neurological causes. Hip and knee osteoarthritis are common non-neurological causes of gait disorders. With advancing age the proportion of patients with multiple causes or combinations of neurological and non-neurological gait disorders increases. Thorough clinical observation of gait, taking a focused patient history and physical, neurological and orthopedic examinations are basic steps in the categorization of gait disorders and serve as a guide for ancillary investigations and therapeutic interventions. This clinically oriented review provides an overview on the phenotypic spectrum, work-up and treatment of gait disorders.",

Using correlational studies and structural analyses, evidence is provided that unusual sleep experiences, dissociation, and schizotypy belong to a common domain. It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue). The paper also outlines the methodological limitations of the existing evidence and makes suggestions for future research. Finally, three models for the overlap of daytime and nighttime symptoms are reviewed, including biological abnormalities, trauma, and personality traits. Although further research is needed, it is suggested that daytime and nighttime symptoms result from problems with sleep-wake state boundaries, which may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition, association between daytime and nighttime symptoms can be attributed to the higher order personality trait of Oddity.",

      "abstract": "Le sommeil joue un role majeur dans les processus de consolidation des apprentissages. Les performances des sujets lors de la restitution de tests de memoire sont meilleures lorsque les phases d'apprentissage et de restitution sont separees par une periode de sommeil plutot que par une periode d'eveil. Les effets du sommeil sur ces processus de consolidation ont largement ete etudies chez l'adulte, notamment a l'aide de protocoles de privation de sommeil specifiques. Neanmoins, l'utilisation de ces protocoles de privation de sommeil est impossible chez les enfants pour des raisons d'ethique. Nos connaissances actuelles relatives aux effets du sommeil sur les processus de consolidation des apprentissages dependants du sommeil sont donc tres limitees chez l'enfant. Les troubles du sommeil touchent une proportion non negligeable des enfants et ont des repercussions diurnes importantes, notamment au niveau academique. De maniere surprenante, bien que la majorite des enfants ayant des troubles du sommeil soit en echec scolaire, l'impact de ces troubles du sommeil sur les processus de consolidation des apprentissages dependants du sommeil a tres rarement ete evalue. L'objectif de ce projet de these etait donc d'evaluer l'impact des troubles du sommeil sur ces processus de consolidation. Pour atteindre cet objectif, nous avons selectionne 3 pathologies presentant des atteintes specifiques du sommeil : la narcolepsie, le syndrome d'apnees obstructives du sommeil (SAOS) et l'epilepsie benigne de l'enfant a pointes centro-temporales (EPCT). Nous avons soumis ces groupes d'enfants ainsi qu'un groupe d'enfants controles apparies en âge et en sexe a des tests de consolidation mnesique dont la phase d'apprentissage etait realisee le soir avant le coucher et la phase de restitution le matin apres la nuit post-apprentissage. Afin d'avoir la vision la plus complete possible de l'impact des troubles du sommeil sur les processus de consolidation des apprentissages, ces tests de consolidation mnesique impliquaient des apprentissages de nature declarative (tâches verbale, visuo-spatiale et emotionnelle) et non-declarative (tâche procedurale). Nous avons egalement mesure les capacites attentionnelles des enfants avant l'apprentissage et avant la restitution des tests de consolidation mnesique. Les resultats que nous avons obtenus semblent indiquer que la narcolepsie, le SAOS et l'EPCT auraient un impact negatif sur les processus de consolidation des apprentissages visuo-spatiaux dependants du sommeil. En revanche, ces 3 pathologies ne semblent pas avoir d'influence sur ces processus dans le cadre des apprentissages verbal, emotionnel et procedural. Ces resultats suggerent donc que les aspects concernant la consolidation nocturne des apprentissages devraient etre integres dans les evaluations neuropsychologiques rentrant en compte dans le diagnostic des enfants porteurs de ces pathologies. De plus, les suivis pedagogique et reeducatif de ces enfants devraient etre reconsideres",

Depression is common and serious problem that often starts in childhood. Today is estimated that approximatly 10-15% of children in general population has syptoms of depression. It is associated with an increased risk of other psychiatric disorders, poor academic success, underdeveloped social skills and even suicidal thoughts. The primary symptoms of depression are continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness and mood changes. Symptoms of depression in children also include irritability or anger, social withdrawal, changes in appetite (either increased or decreased), changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep), difficulty concentrating, etc. Depressive disorders include Major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder, indeterminate and bipolar disorder. Depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Depression should be recognized and diagnosed as early as possible in children and adolescents in order to start treatment on time. The most efficient treatment is a treatment that is not focused on depressive symptoms only, but also on functioning on daily bases in children.",

A video-polysomnography revealed periodic leg movements (figure) and arousal followed by sleep episodes while standing, rhythmic marching, and falling (videos 1 and 2 on the Neurology ® Web site at [Neurology.org][1]). A reevaluation of his history revealed symptoms compatible with restless legs syndrome (RLS). Rotigotine1 proved very effective, supporting the diagnosis of RLS. Periodic leg movement disorder leading to sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder could also be considered. Automatic behavior denotes severe sleep deprivation2 and may represent a non-REM parasomnia. Severe RLS may present with automatic behavior complicating its diagnosis.

In the tourism and hospitality industry, the first burnout factor is the very nature of the service industry, which consists of constant contact between customers and service staff. The second and related burnout factor in tourism and hospitality is emotional labour. This refers to the need for individuals to create a specific facial and bodily display for the public. Another source of stress in this industry is seasonality. In addition, poor working conditions, general irregular working hours, low salaries and the lack of work–life balance are often related to burnout in hospitality and tourism.",

A large proportion of depressed older people are at risk for sleep disturbances, which may be caused by many factors. It was thus the intent of this study to assess the sleeping pattern of depressed elders living in elderly homes. Results of the present study revealed that, the majority of the studied depressed elders had sleeping difficulties and more than half of them took more than 60 minutes in bed to fall asleep. Almost all the subjects woke up more than 3 times during the night, and the most frequently reported causes were frequency of micturition, anxiety, and pain. Three-quarters of the studied elders did not feel comfortable when waking up in the morning, and this affected their ability to perform their daily living activities. It is thus recommended to encourage elderly clients to establish a routine sleep schedule, to stick to rituals that help to relax before bed time and to suggest consultation with appropriate specialist depending on the underlying causes of the sleep disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Testicular torsion is a serious urologic emergency that can present with unusual or atypical history and examination. Classical pain from testicular torsion is of sudden onset, significantly severe, and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. However, in some patients, the initial scrotal pain appears to considerably subside within the next few hours. In others, testicular torsion tends to occur while sleeping, and many patients recount a history of being woken up from sleep by intense pain. Furthermore, some patients in this subset can resume normal activities and even sleep through the night with little or no discomfort, without a perceived need for pain medications. Other patients initially experience mild pain, which worsens over time. Consequently, these patients are less likely to be evaluated immediately. In view of these atypical cases, the question remains unanswered regarding sleep as a predisposing factor for testicular torsion. This narrative review focuses on exploring the association between sleep and testicular torsion.

The metabolic disturbances of the substances above can create a pathological imbalance, which is further aggravated by physiological fluctuations of circadian rhythms, and results in the worsening of RLS symptoms at night. The review concludes with the suggestions for RLS treatment and research directions in the future.",

Hyperactivity is understood as excessive motor activity, fussiness, restlessness, or verbosity that is not adequate to accepted norms. Impulsive behavior involves quick, hasty, thoughtless, hurried actions that carry a high risk of serious harm and injury.

      "abstract": "The prevalence of major depressive episode in the elderly leads to impairment on several aspects of daily life, including life quality, morbid - mortality and increases rates of suicide risks. Stress and life events are frequent triggers of depressive episode in elderly. The present review aimed to explore the aspects related to the onset of depression in old age, focusing on psychosocial and stress. In order to achieve that, we systematically reviewed papers published in the Medline database from 2003-2013. From this study, we verify that depression in the elderly is a complex disorder, more often associated to psychosocial aspects and chronic stress than to genetic and biomarkers. Loneliness, daily and chronic stress, lack of social support, mourning and economical aspects such as retirement and job loss are major risk factors for depression. Generally, negative life events were noticed to cause poorer mental health in advanced age and cumulative stressful events or traumas untreated too. Furthermore, cognitive functions may be affected negatively by lifelong chronic stressors. These events can cause quite a few different impacts in distinct cultures and lifestyles. The consequences also depend on the duration, or on the life period that these episodes occur. The treatment of depression in the elderly should target both medication and psychotherapy in order to account for psychological aspects, especially treatments based on life review. These perspectives are important due to the possibility of development of specific target strategies in order to prevent those risk factors and improve quality of life in elderly. Many points were contradictorily related, overdue the papers had noticed different conclusions about the same studied points. Face of this, we grouped relevant articles with the same results. Notwithstanding, there were points that require more studies, considering the relevance of the theme.",

      "title": "Disorders of Consciousness",
      "abstract": "The concept of consciousness has fascinated philosophers, psychologists and neurophysiologists for a long time; however, it remains difficult to give its univocal and universally accepted definition. Consciousness is defined as \"the state of full awareness of the self and one's relationship to the environment\"; consequently, a distinction must be made between consciousness (or awareness) and vigilance/alertness (wakefulness). In fact, it is possible for a patient to be conscious, but unresponsive to the examiner, for lack of sensory inputs or for psychiatric reasons. Conversely, a subject can be alert and awake with open eyes, but not conscious and not aware (in part or at all) of itself and of the environment. From a neurophysiological point of view, it has been demonstrated that the brainstem Reticular Activating System (RAS) is responsible for the state of alertness, through its projections to the thalamus and cortex. The integrity of the upper cortical centres, which are closely related to each other and receive the reticular activating stimuli, is also essential for the maintenance of consciousness level. Therefore, Disorders Of Consciousness (DOC) and vigilance may depend on damage to one or both of these neurofunctional systems, acute or chronic, reversible or irreversible. Serious damage to the reticular system, with or without concomitant widespread cortical damage, can produce a state of coma. Coma is then a pathological condition in which the subject lies with eyes closed and he is neither conscious nor alert, with altered - or completely absent - responsiveness to stimuli. In case of widespread damage to the cerebral cortex without involvement of the RAS, a particular condition - named Vegetative State (VS) - may occur: the consciousness of self and of the environment is impaired, but a certain level of vigilance is still preserved. Moreover, there also exist several neurological conditions that can be defined as \"borderline\", such as the Minimally Conscious State. Finally, brain death is the irreversible definitive impairment of both the cortical and brainstem functions. Electroencephalography is an important diagnostic and prognostic tool, useful to better characterise the evolution of a coma state, to recognise any kind of epileptiform activity - that could be clinically hidden - and to monitor the effects of antiepileptic drugs, level of sedation, and treatment of intracranial hypertension.",

This category includes chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, stereotypies, tics, and tremor. 2) Hypokinetic movement disorders refers to akinesia (lack of movement), hypokinesia (reduced amplitude of movement), bradykinesia (slow movement), and rigidity. Parkinsonism is the primary hypokinetic movement disorder. Movement disorders may be further categorized into primary and secondary disorders. In primary movement disorders, the abnormal movement is the primary manifestation of the disorder. In secondary movement disorders, a broader structural, toxic, metabolic, or inherited etiologic factor is responsible for the symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The two physiologic components of conscious behaviour, namely arousal (vigilance) and content of consciousness (presence of mind), may be affected differently, depending on the type and distribution of the underlying brain disease. Disturbance of arousal primarily affects wakefulness and awareness and leads to obtundation, stupor and coma. States of reduced arousal are caused by bilateral lesions of the so-called ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), which is situated in the upper brainstem and the paramedian diencephalon. If, on the other hand, cognitive and mnemic function are degraded, the contents of consciousness are disordered; depending on the extent of the disturbance, confusion, lethargy and, finally, a vegetative state ensues. The chronic vegetative state (coma vigil) describes a condition of total mental loss with preserved vegetative functions and arousal. Degraded cognitive and mnenic functions results from either toxic-metabolic or extensive structural disorders of the cerebral cortex, where the limbic and mesial frontal areas play a dominant role for conscious behaviour. If the function of extensive areas of both hemispheres is suddenly depressed, temporarily reduced arousal also results. In order to differentiate between toxic-metabolic and structural brain diseases, the motor reactions, the ocular and the pupillary reflexes must be examined apart from responsiveness.",

      "title": "Neonatal brain injury as a consequence of insufficient cerebral oxygenation.",
      "abstract": "Neonatal brain hypoxic-ischemic injury represents a serious health care and socio-economical problem since it is one of the most common causes of mortality and morbidity of newborns. Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is often associated with signs of perinatal asphyxia, with an incidence of about 2-4 per 1,000 live births and mortality rate up to 20%. In about one half of survivors, cerebral hypoxic-ischemic insult may result in more or less pronounced neuro-psychological sequelae of immediate or delayed nature, such as seizures, cerebral palsy or behavioural and learning disabilities, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Hypoxic-ischemic injury develops as a consequence of transient or permanent restriction of blood supply to the brain. Severity of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy varies depending on the intensity and duration of hypoxia-ischemia, on the type and size of the brain region affected, and on the maturity of the foetal/neonatal brain. Though a primary cause of hypoxic-ischemic injury is lack of oxygen in the neonatal brain, underlying mechanisms of subsequent events that are critical for developing hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy are less understood. Their understanding is however necessary for elaborating effective management for newborns that underwent cerebral hypoxic-ischemic insult and thus are at risk of a negative outcome. The present paper summarizes current knowledge on cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury of the neonate, fundamental processes involved in etiopathogenesis, with a special focus on cellular and molecular mechanisms and particular attention on certain controversial aspects of oxidative stress involvement.",

They can be benign or physiologic, or may lead to sleep disruption of the person or their bed partner. Sleep-related movement disorders are simple, usually stereotyped movements that disturb sleep. Examples include bruxism, nocturnal leg cramps, and sleep starts. These movements need to be distinguished from more complex motor activities which are called parasomnias, such as REM sleep behavior disorder or sleepwalking. This distinction can typically be accomplished by taking a detailed history and physical, but may require the use of in-laboratory, attended polysomnography. Commonly included in the classification of sleep-related movement disorders is restless legs syndrome, which, though a complex activity, is frequently associated with periodic limb movements of sleep which more clearly fit the description of a sleep-related movement disorder. Restless legs syndrome is a common, yet frequently missed, cause of sleep disruption in the population. Effective and safe treatments, such as dopamine agonists, exist for this condition.",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

The mechanisms involved in permanent loss are direct mechanical destruction, following high intensity noise exposure, and metabolic decompensation with subsequent degeneration of sensory elements, following moderate intensity noise exposure. Both these cause their own pattern of cochlear histological abnormality, while the only morphological correlate to temporary threshold shift is an increase in the number and size of liposomes, mainly in the outer hair cells after longer periods of repeated temporary threshold shift. There are critical intensity levels which determine the type and extent of damage, and for any given exposure intensity a saturation of damage is reached over time. There is great variability in acoustic cochlear damage, especially that of the delayed metabolic type, the type which results from conditions which predominate in our actual noise environment.",

      "abstract": "Mathematical modeling approaches for the respiratory system are done on different abstraction/subsystem levels, depending upon the hypothesis and assumptions. Differential equations are used to describe dynamics of such systems. In the literature, various types of models are available. For example, some models describe the regulation of gases, on the other hand, some models link mouth pressure and air flow. Each of these models are complete for that particular subsystem, considering other subsystems of the body are at steady state. However, there are certain deviations, when a problem related to one subsystem is manifested in other subsystems. Cheyne-Stokes Respiration is one of such condition, which might generate from congestive heart failure or obstructive sleep apnea or central sleep apnea and it is reflected in waxing and waning of the tidal volume, possibly with the presence of apnea and hypopnea. These types of breathing patterns are caused by malfunction of the regulation system or cardiovascular system or neural system. In this work, combining models of the regulation system, breathing mechanism and neural system are considered. Using modulation hypothesis, the combined model is capable of generating Cheyne-Stokes Respiration waveforms. A new parameter, similar to modulation index is introduced to achieve different levels of apnea and hypopnea, which can quantify the diseased condition.",

      "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a leading role in controlling visceral functions and it is well known that the increase of sympathetic activity underlies most of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. On the other hand parasympathetic activity acts as protective factor against the above mentioned conditions. Sleep breathing disorders (SBD) are commonly divided in three syndromes: obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, central sleep apnoea syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing syndrome, the latter two both characterized by cyclic non-obstructive\r\nbreathing patterns. Cheyne-Stokes Respiration is a form of periodic breathing characterized by a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of ventilation with(CSR-CSA) or without (CSR) central apnoea. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is significantly associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. OSA exerts strong modulatory effects on the autonomic nervous system through a number of mechanisms including central respiratory-cardiac coupling in the brain stem, chemo-reflex stimulation, baro-reflexes, and reflexes relating to lung inflation. EEG arousals, often related to apnea termination, also represent the final way of autonomic activation. CSR is common among patients with congestive heart failure, being present in \r\n30-40% of the two largest reported. If CSR “per se” promotes an increase of sympathetic outflow during sleep is not really known. Several lines of argument would support the hypothesis that CSR may be a compensatory mechanism for severe HF.",

      "abstract": "Nocturia, the need to awaken at night to void, is a highly prevalent disorder that negatively affects nocturnal sleep, increases daytime tiredness, and adversely impacts quality of life. In this selective review, we provide the reader an overview of current work in this area. From the perspective of disturbed sleep, two divergent perspectives have emerged from the literature when discussing nocturia. The first is that a patient awakens because of an urge to urinate. The second is that a patient awakens during the night for some reason unrelated to urinary urge (e.g., an awakening from an environmental source or from intrinsic lightening of sleep) and then decides to void while awake. In the few studies that have inquired about nocturia as a cause of awakenings, nocturia often ranks above the traditional psychological or physical factors. Not only is nocturia likely to disrupt sleep, but it may impact waking quality of life as well. A number of generic and nocturia‐related questionnaires have been used to quantify the effect of nocturia on quality of life. In this short paper, we introduce the reader to several key studies in these important areas. Neurourol. Urodynam. 33:S15–S18, 2014 . © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "abstract": "Blepharospasm is a disease that results in an increased rate of bilateral eyelid closure, mainly attributed to the involuntary contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscles. Blepharospasm is a type of dystonia. Dystonia falls under the classification of movement disorders and is characterized by either sustained or intermittent contraction of a muscle. This leads to abnormal repetitive movements or postures which tend to have a certain pattern and maybe twisting or tremulous in nature. In most dystonias, voluntary action typically leads to exacerbation of dystonia due to overactivation of muscles.Dystonia has the potential to affect any part of the body and can present at a wide range of ages.Dystonia can be classified according to its distribution across the body: Focal dystonia refers to dystonia which affects only one isolated region of the body. Segmental dystonia refers to dystonia which affects 2 or more contiguous regions of the body. Multifocal dystonia refers to dystonia which affects 2 or more non-contiguous regions. Hemidystonia refers to dystonia which affects half of the body. Generalized dystonia refers to dystonia which affects the trunk along with 3 other sites. Dystonia can have a static or progressive course of the disease. Furthermore, the variability of symptoms can be classified according to how often they occur: Persistent dystonia refers to dystonia that persists at the same extent throughout a day Action-specific dystonia refers to dystonia that only occurs when performing a certain activity Diurnal fluctuation refers to dystonia which fluctuates throughout the day with a circadian variation in severity Paroxysmal dystonia refers to sudden episodes of dystonia typically induced by a trigger Examples of focal dystonia include blepharospasm, oromandibular dystonia, writers cramp, spasmodic dysphonia, and torticollis.Blepharospasm is a focal dystonia characterized by the simultaneous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles, resulting in involuntary eyelid closure, the first report of patients with blepharospasm comes from a description of 10 patients, made by Henri Meige in 1910: these patients had involuntary eyelid closure in association with contraction of the muscles of the jaw. In his paper, Maige named this phenomenon Convulsions de la Face (convulsions of the face).This article will review the etiology, epidemiology, history, evaluation, and management of blepharospasm.",

      "abstract": "Typically, the anxiety is manageable and since it occurs under only certain conditions, it usually doesn't have life-altering consequences. Anxiety disorder can refer to several related conditions that differ with respect to their features, course, underlying processes, and treatment. These disorders, which can begin in childhood, affect about 15–20 percent of individuals, being about twice as common in females relative to males. This chapter discusses various anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social phobia and social anxiety. Of the various anxiety disorders, one that seems particularly puzzling is panic disorder. The neurochemical processes thought to be associated with panic disorder are the same as those associated with other anxiety-related disorders. OCD is characterized by repetitive obsessions that may comprise persistent, distressing and intrusive thoughts or images, together with compulsions or urges to perform specific acts or rituals.",

      "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and obesity: A dangerous triad",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep-disordered breathing. It is characterized by recurrent partial or complete obstruction of the upper airways during sleep, which leads to repetitive episodes of reduction (hypopnea) or absence of airflow (apnea) and intermittent hypoxia and arousal.1 The major risk factors for OSA are obesity, male sex, and advanced age.2 The prevalence of OSA is continuously increasing in developed countries in conjunction with the epidemic obesity.3, 4 The present \"gold\" standard for evaluation of sleep and sleep-related breathing is the polysomnography (PSG) with up to 12 recording channels including nasal and oral airflow, respiratory effort transducers, electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and oximetry.5 The severity of obstructive sleep apnea is classified based on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)—number of apneic/hypopneic episodes per hour: 5-15, mild; 15-30, moderate; 30 or more, severe.4 The Wisconsin Sleep Cohort study recently reported that the prevalence of moderate to severe OSA (ie, AHI ≥ 15 events per hour) was 10% (95% confidence interval (CI): 7-12) among 30- to 49-year-old men; 17% (95% CI: 15-21) among 50- to 70-year-old men; 3% (95% CI: 2-4) among 30- to 49-year-old women; and 9% (95% CI: 7-11) among 50- to 70-year-old women.6 These estimated prevalence rates represent a substantial increase over the last 2 decades (relative increase of 14%-55%, depending on the subgroup). There is overwhelming epidemiologic evidence supporting the causal, bidirectional relationship between OSA and hypertension (HTN). Not only that OSA predisposes patients to HTN development, but also increases an incidence of OSA in hypertensive patients.4, 7, 8 Numerous studies have shown the strong association between OSA and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, large vessel disease, and cerebrovascular disease.4, 9, 10 The main acute changes in OSA are intermittent hypoxia, intrapleural pressure changes, and sleep fragmentation, which together induce endothelial dysfunction, sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, and increased oxidative stress.4, 11 Another mechanism, that potentially could contribute to the development of HTN in OSA, is increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).12 Obesity, especially central adiposity, has been recognized as one of the strongest risk factors for OSA for a long time. Due to current pandemic of obesity in the Western countries, the prevalence of OSA is likely to increase.13 In the Sleep Heart Health Study, weight gain of 10 kilograms over a 5-year period conferred a 5.2- and 2.5-fold increase in the likelihood of increasing the AHI by 15 events per hour in men and women, respectively.14 Obesity and OSA tend to coexist and they are associated with inflammation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure (BP), but the causal relation is still not clear.15 While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the main therapy for OSA, its effect on blood pressure (BP) reduction has not been established yet due to the multifactorial nature of HTN.4 Moreover, the impact of CPAP treatment on BP is inconsistent: In minimally symptomatic patients, CPAP has a neutral effect on BP,16 whereas in subjects with resistant hypertension, CPAP can decrease the systolic BP by 5-7 mm Hg.17 Although obesity is a risk factor for OSA and an independent risk factor for HTN, the influence of obesity on BP response to CPAP treatment in adults with OSA is unknown. Moreover, data regarding influence of obesity on BP response to CPAP treatment in adults with OSA are still scarce. In this issue of the Journal, Kuna et al assessed the BP response to CPAP treatment in obese and non-obese adults with OSA.18 This consecutive multicenter study included 188 OSA patients with AHI ≥ 15, which were divided into two groups: obese and non-obese subjects. Additionally, they underwent 24-hour BP monitoring and 24-hour urinary norepinephrine collection at baseline. Obesity was assessed by waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), and abdominal visceral fat volume (captured with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). Participants adherent to CPAP treatment were reassessed after 4 months. Primary outcomes were 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) and 24-hour urinary norepinephrine level. The results indicate that obesity was not the factor that influenced BP response to treatment of adults with OSA and that BP response to CPAP treatment was not related to baseline 24-hour urinary norepinephrine or change in 24-hour urinary norepinephrine after treatment. Several previous studies reported that change in sympathetic nervous activity, measured by plasma or urinary catecholamine levels, did not correlate with the BP response to CPAP treatment.19-21 Although measurement of urinary catecholamine levels did not detect the effect of sympathetic overactivity on BP in adults with OSA, the authors postulate that it might be possible that measuring muscle sympathetic nerve activity could reveal a significant relationship because sympathetic overactivity has an important role in OSA-related cardiovascular remodeling22 and contributes to a cardiovascular morbidity in these patients23 While the authors found that the participants with OSA had a significant reduction in 24-hour mean arterial pressure following CPAP treatment, there were no significant correlations between the three obesity measures (waist circumference, BMI, and abdominal visceral fat) and change in BP measures. In addition, investigators did not find differences in BP responses comparing obese and non-obese participants. The authors explained negative results by the limited number of subjects in both groups—obese and non-obese patients and suggested that larger studies are necessary. Although the results appear negative, this current study definitely has several important strengths. First, the objective to determine the BP response after CPAP treatment in obese patients was novel. Second, the authors used several parameters for obesity assessment such as waist circumference, body mass index, and abdominal fat volume and not only body mass index, as it is the case with previous studies. Continuous positive airway pressure is recognized as an effective therapy for OSA, but adherence is still suboptimal despite numerous developments in machine dynamics including quieter pumps, softer masks, and improved portability.24 Adherence to CPAP remains relatively low (30%-60%), which continues to be the largest problem with this kind of therapy.25 The main limitation of the present study, which was also claimed by the authors, was a limited sample size that significantly decreased statistical power to less than 80%. The study did not include individuals who were non-adherent to CPAP in order to compare them with those who used CPAP. Additionally, the current investigation involved also normotensive individuals. However, previous studies revealed that patients with higher baseline BP and untreated or resistant HTN had the largest benefit from CPAP therapy.17, 26 It is well known that obesity represents a major risk factor for OSA.2 Surprisingly, there is still a lack of clinical data on the response (eg, BP reduction) to existing therapies such as CPAP in obese and non-obese patients with OSA. The detailed phenotyping and physiological characteristics of obese and non-obese OSA patients and their response to prescribed therapy remain to be clarified in larger, prospective, and randomized studies in the future.

      "title": "Perspective on insomnia in disorders of consciousness",
      "abstract": "In most individuals, consciousness waxes and wanes in a circadian (24 h) rhythm in the sleep-wake cycle. However, this cycle can be majorly disturbed in disorders of consciousness (DoC1), to the point where it is unclear between what states an individual may alternate given the absence of full-blown wakefulness or all usual characteristics of sleep. Diagnostic groups, like vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS), that show some arousal but no awareness, and minimally conscious state (MCS), where arousal is coupled to partially preserved awareness, can be differentiated based on sleep characteristics that are less prominent in the former.2-4 Etiologies for these DoC's (e.g., traumatic brain injury [TBI], hemorrhage, anoxia, or an infection) vary wildly, as does to the resulting brain injury; however, despite these differences, there is a clear commonality that the sleep-wake regulating areas of the brain are often affected.1 In fact, injury to these areas, such as the ascending reticular activating system and the thalamus, has been implied to be the cause for DoC5 as they have a crucial role in the regulation and maintenance of arousal.6 These areas are associated to regular sleep too7 and are often affected in sleep disorders (see https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/sleep/, for instance, for the prominent role of the brainstem arousal systems). It is well recognized in the general population that poor sleep leads to a wide array of mental and physical changes that are deleterious to our well-being.8, 9 Self-reported regular problems with sleep (i.e., 3 nights a week for 3 months) are diagnosed as insomnia disorder (DSM-5-TR10). Although insomnia disorder can occur on its own, it is often comorbid with many other diseases like Parkinson's disease11 and concussions resulting from a mild TBI.12 Insomnia disorder is also considered a risk factor for the development of various disorders, from major depression13 to obesity.9 Although these are just examples, a large body of literature suggests that insomnia disorder is a major player in a vast matrix of disease. Crucially, a core feature of insomnia disorder is the self-report of sleep complaints, something DoC patients cannot communicate. Yet, there are various hints toward the existence of insomnia disorder in this population. With the crucial absence of self-report in the DoC population, there is no DSM-5-based diagnosis. The current research will focus on objective markers of sleep disturbances that in the self-reporting population correlate with their symptoms of insomnia disorder. Because of this focus on symptoms of sleep loss, we generally refer to this as putative insomnia (i.e., not insomnia disorder per DSM-5 criteria) in the DoC population. First of all, about 10% of the general population would be diagnosed with insomnia,14 whereas up to 40% suffer intermittently from insomnia-related complaints.15 Perhaps sleep complaints increase the chance of suffering a DoC, from the increased risk of an accident that could cause a TBI16 to increased risk of a stroke that could cause a DoC.17 Moreover, as stated above, the brain structures affected in DoC are likely including sleep-wake regulatory systems, which arguably makes insomnia-kind complaints more likely. Furthermore, a study on medical complications during the recovery process of DoC patients noted that 6.2% (third most common) of all complications were related to sleep disturbances.18 In a notable comment they say: \"These problems may appear less often in the literature on medical complications, because they are viewed as intrinsic parts of the sequelae and recovery process of TBI.\" Importantly, early diagnosis and treatment of comorbid sleep disturbances in DoC have been added to recent guidelines by the American Academy of Neurology.19 A mild TBI, not resulting in a DoC as considered in this review but with post-concussive symptoms20, 21, leaves an astounding 46% of patients diagnosed with a sleep disorder.22 Others have reported a prevalence of insomnia complaints in 30% up to 70% of TBI patients,23 half of which may be related to a circadian rhythm disorder.24 Even in the whole population of hospitalized patients, sleep is already poorer than in the general population.25 Based on this evidence, we pose that sleep disorders may play an underestimated role in the disease of recovery of DoC patients. In this perspective, we delve into the seemingly unseen consequences of the tight relation between insomnia and DoC. To this end, we discuss the intersection of the alterations and treatment of both. First, we will discuss remarkable similarities between alterations found in insomnia and DoC on a behavioral and neuroimaging level. Next, we will discuss a physiological common ground that may pave the way for future research and their relationship. Finally, we will discuss treatments with effects on both, while they are often only meant to target one. As introduced, there is a range of commonalities between DoC and insomnia-related alterations. Evidence for the commonalities between these two conditions stems from behavioral, (functional) magnetic resonance imagining, and electrophysiology (EEG) studies. It is important to note that there are two paths to the shared pathophysiology of DoC and insomnia. Patients with a DoC suffered from a clear initiating factor in the form of severe brain injury, whereas for insomnia patients, the initiating factor is much less clear. However, there seems to be a bidirectional (or even aggravating) effect between insomnia symptoms and behavioral and neurophysiological effects (Figure 1). The commonalities between the two diseases will be discussed in more detail below and are summarized in Table 1. In general, we hypothesize that some of these negative effects can synergize to exacerbate their consequences in isolation. Putatively, symptoms are also interconnected where the existence of one symptom could lead to aggravation in another, but this is beyond the scope of this review. Overview of alterations in insomnia and their potential aggravation of DoC characteristics. In the top left insomnia is shown as its own construct, with its own (unknown, varying) causes, where several symptoms can end up in the outer ring of potentially interacting symptoms (example dashed, two-way lines). In the bottom right is severe brain injury that leads to a DoC. This clear cause has immediate neurophysiological effects (example solid lines) that could also be insomnia characteristics. Together, these interacting symptoms may worsen DoC characteristics. DoC, disorder of consciousness. Behavioral assessment in patients with DoC is challenging, and often limited to tools for the diagnosis of the state of consciousness using adapted scales such as the CRS-R.46 By definition, these patients cannot provide a subjective report on their cognitive state, adding a level of complexity to the comparison. However, few studies on the DoC population or proxy populations can be used to start this investigation. Insomnia may be related to increased experiences of pain,28 also altered in DoC.29 Besides the general association of insomnia with decreased quality of life26 and physical well-being,47 the experience of pain could decrease potentially the quality of life27 in DoC patients, urging increased attention toward insomnia detection and treatment in this population. A study mentioned insomnia may enhance cognitive difficulties that resulted from a TBI,24 but it remains unclear through which process. Potentially, working memory deficiencies may play a role, as they do in non-TBI insomnia,32 and also commonly found following TBI.33 Insomnia has also been shown to decrease motivation and reward sensitivity,30 also a major player in the TBI recovery process.31 Moreover, in akinetic mutism, a disorder characterized by a lack of motivation leading to a DoC-like lack of behavior, sleep has also been shown to be deteriorated.48 In the DoC population, it would be problematic to not detect signs of consciousness based on difficulties that do arise from insomnia (e.g., keeping instructions to a simple task in working memory, decreased motivation to follow them). Insomnia has been related to mood disturbances and depression,34 which is also present in 56.3% of recovering mild TBI patients.35 Investigations of brain organization in insomnia have been mixed, with some reporting atrophy in the superior frontal cortex,49 whereas others found hypertrophy in the orbito-frontal cortex.50 Indeed, studies into insomnia have shown mostly cortical differences from controls,14 whereas the early mentioned neurosynth analysis shows more arousal-related areas (see https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/sleep/). A meta-analysis aimed at structural differences at insomnia found a lack of consistent alterations.51 However, as the DoC population, the insomnia population is highly heterogeneous.52 Therefore, some interesting common findings across both populations are discussed in the next paragraph. In patients with DoC, widespread cortical atrophy is a common occurrence.36 Functionally connectivity between areas is decreased in the DoC population.41 This functional connectivity includes the salience network, whose functional connectivity has also been shown to be affected by insomnia.39, 40 Additionally, engagement of task-relevant and suppression of task-irrelevant (i.e., default mode network) has been shown to be altered in insomnia.37 Although a reliable assessment of the default mode network in DoC during tasks is challenging, it has been shown that the integrity of its structural connectivity is severely compromised.38 Furthermore, an auditory irregularity detection task (oddball-task) has been shown to be useful in consciousness assessments in DoC where the detection of the global deviant is associated with the presence of consciousness.42 Interestingly, there is evidence that insomnia leads to increased attention toward irrelevant stimuli (i.e., relatively decreasing the oddball detection).14 This may be related to the prominent observation in insomnia of hyperarousal, a maladaptive increase in arousal that may decrease useful filtering capacities.53 Although DoC patients show some level of arousal, the functionality of this arousal in governing directed behavior is sometimes questionable. As a result, the over-reactivity to the environment in hyperarousal could lead to undirected behavior, while also in patients with a DoC, for instance, through the CRS-R assessment, a separation occurs between directed (conscious) and undirected (unconscious) behavior. This hyperarousal might also be related to the previous observation on the network level, where it alters their temporal dynamics (e.g., more dwell-time in functional states without proper filtering) where similar functional connectivity changes have been observed in patients with a DoC.41 It is known that higher prominence of alpha power has great clinical relevance in a multicenter study of DoC patients.45 Modulations of alpha have been observed in insomnia patients as well, with decreases during wakefulness and increases during sleep in insomnia patients.43, 44 Hyperarousal is also associated with increased high-frequency EEG power (in the beta band) during both sleep and wakefulness.43, 54 Now, higher frequencies such as in the alpha and beta range are associated with better diagnosis and outcome in the DoC population,55, 56 but this research also highlights that often the brain is pathologically slowed down. As a consequence, hyperarousal in patients with a DoC does not necessarily mean the appearance of beta activity, but it could increase previously slowed down dynamics. In turn, this could potentially lead to the finding of higher frequencies in patients that are not reflected in behavioral signs of consciousness. As a final note, not only does disturbed sleep have brain-related effects, it has been argued that the whole body may be affected by its effects (e.g., insulin resistance).57 As will become apparent below, the regulation of slow oscillatory activity of the brain, as cornerstone of healthy sleep and thereby potentially affected in insomnia, is altered in DoC.45 As the foundation of electrical brain activity in general, with such a prominent role in the damaged and sleeping brain, a discussion on slow waves is here at its right place. As will be seen in the next section, sleep-affecting treatments of DoC seem to alter slow-wave physiology too. On a physiological level, loss of consciousness is associated with general slowing of cortical activity.58 Whole-brain monotonic slow oscillatory activity as background activity or in the absence of most sleep characteristics has been reported in DoC patients. This pattern may originate from neuronal networks that, even in vitro, generate slow (∼1 Hz) oscillations originating from recurrent excitation that is regulated by inhibitory networks.59 As such, slow oscillations around the 1 Hz (i.e., in the delta range) were proposed as the default activity of the cerebral cortex, that in that form also give rise to slow oscillating phenomena observed during sleep.60 Brain pathologies can also present with slow oscillations, and as such, \"pathological slow waves\" are defined as slow waves that occur during wakefulness, as opposed to sleep slow waves. One way of distinguishing slow oscillations and such \"pathological slow waves\" is by including electromyography in addition to EEG activity (i.e., high muscle tone suggests the presence of pathological slow waves).61 The distinction of physiological and pathological slow waves is considered when performing sleep scored, with slow activity measured on electrodes over damaged brain areas being excluded from sleep-scoring patients with a DoC.62 However, problems with this assumption arise from the fact that even outside of the DoC population, sleep can be organized locally.63-65 Slow waves and spindles specifically are a local process based on scalp EEG,66 arising/fading with the paired breakdown/emergence of long-range connectivity.67 Interestingly, these local slow waves also occur in healthy controls.68 Moreover, eye-opening that has previously been interpreted as signaling wakefulness in DoC patients can be associated with both objective markers of sleep and wakefulness,1 with one study finding that sleep can be predicted based on eye-opening and -closure in less than half (11 out of 23) of the patients.69 With these findings, it becomes clear that separating pathological slow waves from sleep slow waves is not an easy task, especially in the absence of clear other physiological signs (e.g., originating from a source of injured brain tissue, potential characteristics like slow or amplitude that could separate them). In the discussed literature, this distinction is not taken into account (e.g., it is unclear if slow-wave sleep was sometimes scored because of the presence of pathological slow was too). By highlighting their prominence here, in both insomnia and DoC, we hope that future empirical research will dive deeper into this distinction. The pattern of low functional connectivity is a defining feature of decreased consciousness in DoC.45, 70 Indeed, the network and cellular generation of slow waves is a primarily local process,60 but horizontal layer 5 neurons and synchronization with the thalamus may provide a global appearance.71 Local generation may also be observed in the VS/UWS patient with thalamic lesions that were associated with delta activity over all electrodes.62 However, slow activity specifically in the parietal cortex and its connection to the thalamus has been noted to be an important contributor to consciousness, as measured in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques.72 This parietal slow-wave activity in children with DoC is reduced, but more parietal slow-wave activity is related to better outcomes.73 Moreover, the gray matter volumes in both the parietal cortex and thalamus have been shown to discriminate VS/UWS from MCS patients.74 In combination with a relation between the gray matter volume and slow-wave amplitude,75 this findings could increase interest in parietal slow waves as, unlike global slow waves, they could be associated with higher level of consciousness. Slow waves are reliably associated with unconsciousness,76 but the reason for their occurrence in DoC patients remains speculative. From the perspective of a neuronal circuit, slow-wave activity may be the rhythms isolated networks resort to as a default, as was discussed above. Whether this return to default activity is maladaptive, for example, blocking possibilities for neuronal activity that could support more complex functions, or compensatory, for example, allowing for basic neuronal functions in areas that otherwise would not function are hypotheticals. As such, although unconsciousness is correlated with slow-wave activity, this relation is not necessarily causal. To the best of our knowledge, separation of slow waves that occur during sleep, those that occur during wakefulness in sleep deprivation,77 and those prominent in DoC is challenging. In fact, there is no evidence to assume they are different besides the behavioral state in which they occur. Similar cellular and local circuitry may underlie their generation and maintenance, from the viewpoint where the neuronal population resorts to the most efficient way of rest while maintaining the possibility to go into an active state.60 These periods of rest may be necessary for cellular maintenance,78 but the mantra in pathological states seems to relate them to damage rather than having any functional role. Yet, there is, for instance, no evidence for slow waves that occur in the awake and aware brain to have different origins (and putative functions) than those occurring during sleep.71 Importantly, slow waves are not only implicated in cellular regulation but also in behavioral improvements through memory consolidation.79 Given these putative functions of slow wave that are essential to life, it seems striking that the literature has reported that patients with a DoC have prominent slow activity,80 but the amplitude for these delta waves does often not reach the required threshold to score it as sleep,1 although it has been described that a great reduction in the ability to generate slow-wave sleep is fatal (i.e., a condition called fatal insomnia81). This suggest that the slow waves in patients with a DoC might perform a similar function as during sleep, albeit that sleep physiology has changed. Supporting this suggestion, others claim that all animals sleep regardless of any nonfatal lesion, even when their injury affects sleep regulatory systems.65 Some have argued that sleep is the price to pay for wakefulness, allowing for a necessary downscaling of synapses.78 This argument presents an interesting perspective in DoC, where the border between sleep and wakefulness is arguably shifted, with less full-blown wakefulness possibly decreasing the need for sleep. On the other hand, the need for sleep may also increase, as it is implicated in tissue repair.82 The potential implication of unnecessary downscaling for the progression of a DoC is hard to estimate. There are others that show sleep slow waves have also been implicated in the widespread up-regulation of cortical synapses.83 Answering this question remains challenging, but if either process is present during slow oscillatory activity in DoC patients, this may present a mechanism for the internal improvement of brain function, noting that not all improvement is necessarily functionally measurable at the behavioral level. Finally, slow waves are not necessarily only associated with unconsciousness,76 as the up-state of a slow wave may provide opportunities for consciousness.84 Slow-wave sleep has indeed been shown to be an active state, where wake-like neural activity patterns emerge during the up-states.85 These local desynchronized patterns in the EEG are remarkably similar to the EEG during full-blown wakefulness, suggesting a potential for similar functions.84 In children with Angelman syndrome, delta oscillations are even very prominent during normal wakefulness.86 While asleep, slow waves may be crucial for the generation of spindles and they have also been shown to group high-frequency oscillations to increase the effectiveness of information transfer.71 This high-frequency activity relies on local circuits of excitatory and interneurons and is crucial for a wide range of cognitive functions.87, 88 The grouping may also facilitate coherence between oscillations of separate neuronal populations, thereby possibly enabling communication89 though this is debated. A wakeful behavioral state can be characterized by slow-wave activity, but evidence investigating complexity shows that slow-wave activity is not necessarily equal across behavioral states with, for instance, complexity dropping from wakefulness to sleep in Angelman syndrome despite both having slow waves.80 Slow oscillation seems to be important for the organization of brain activity from the ground up while having a potentially nonlinear relation with consciousness. Together, this also provides angles for research in insomnia, for example, does the reported lack of sleep originate in periods of consciousness during slow waves? It is interesting to know that the transition of a down-state to an up-state depends on the size of the network, with increasing transition probability if more synapses impinge on a neuron with their excitatory post-synaptic potentials.71 The widespread cortical atrophy in DoC of course may limit these possibilities. The persistence of an up-state is mainly maintained by recurrent excitatory synaptic activity, with a minor role for inhibitory, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) distributing neurons.71 The inhibitory regulation is constant, except during up-state initiation and termination where excitation dominates. Specifically the slow-acting GABAB receptors are implicated instead of the fast GABAA, but the integrity of structural connections may determine these effects as fast acting GABAA may also be effective cortical slices in the absence of a thalamocortical loop.90 Interestingly, while the brainstem plays no major role in slow-wave generation, transitions from up to down-states were abolished when it was stimulated.91 In this section, we discuss treatments under investigation in DoC patients or in insomnia, but we select only a limited number to provide some context on them in relation to each other (for an overview of all treatment options see Ref. 92). A general remark is that when treatment is aimed at increasing consciousness (e.g., increase arousal), it is likely to influence sleep. Yet, treatments successfully increasing arousal seldom report if this affected sleep (e.g., improved subsequent sleep or disturbed sleep). As a take-home from the section on insomnia above, we know that arousal can be maladaptive and should thus also be balanced. Circadian rhythms may also play a role in treatments, because stimulation might be more effective during the physiological day time rather than the night. The only recommended pharmacological treatment for DoC, the glutamatergic antagonist amantadine, has been shown to accelerate recovery in TBI patients, but not affect the sleep-wake cycle in DoC and will not be discussed in this Section.19, 93 Zolpidem is an indirect GABAA agonist that depresses the central nervous system (CNS) and is an approved and widely prescribed treatment of insomnia.94 It has been applied in DoC patients who showed sleep disturbance or restlessness and led in several cases to sudden, but temporary improvements in consciousness.95 In a case report investigating the EEG response to zolpidem, slow oscillations were not investigated and the response mainly related to increased connectivity in faster frequencies (beta band, 15–30 Hz).96 An increase in power and coherence in the same range was also seen in 3 other patients, now also coupled with a decrease in power and coherence in the slower 6–10 Hz range.97 Yet, the precise mechanisms of this contradictory event, especially on slow oscillatory activity, remains unknown. Purely speculative, it would be interesting to see what the effect of zolpidem is on slow waves, as in some cases, GABA is known to increase the persistence of the up-state, which in turn is associated with consciousness, possibly partly mediated through local excitatory/inhibitory loops that also involve GABA signaling.80, 87 Indeed, GABA has been shown to have a crucial role in the persistence of high frequency oscillations.98 Burst-suppression in DoC patients has been successfully reduced by treatment with zolpidem.99 Indeed, a GABA agonist can cause a hyperpolarization that limits action potential generation, disorganizes and speeds up slow waves, and counters burst-suppression.100 The anesthetic propofol, a GABAA agonist, has been shown to also incur a paradoxical effect on DoC patients.101 The reconfiguration that happens under this anesthesia might be indicative of recovery.102 There is an ongoing debate on the role of GABA in slow-wave generation.103 Where some research suggests the inhibitory properties of GABAergic neurons shape the slow oscillation,104 others propose the continuation of hyperpolarization in sleep is not affected by GABA.105 Most likely, GABAergic inhibition plays a small role.90 On the level of EEG, slow waves seem to be enhanced by pharmacological interventions with GABA receptor agonists.103 Interestingly, enhancement of slow waves during sleep and thereby enhancing memory is promising, although still inconsistent.106 Besides GABAA, the slow acting GABAB receptor might play a role in consciousness. Many DoC patients suffer from spasticity which can effectively be treated with intrathecal baclofen,107 a GABAB receptor agonist. This treatment has also been reported to be paired with behavioral improvements, such as more sustained eye-opening.108 One of the proposed mechanisms is the GABA-driven normalization of activity in thalamocortical circuits, thereby improving sleep-wake cycles, but these findings remain speculative.109 The repeated observation of GABA-related mechanisms above is striking. There is some literature on how the induction of inhibition may show better effects than excitation.110 Interestingly, it has been proposed that CNS depression (e.g., by providing the brain with inhibitory GABAergic stimulation) is more effective at awakening effects, whereas excitation can be induced to support other functions once this has been established.111 In relation to sleep, the effects of GABA may differ based on the receptors it activates, with GABAA receptors being implicated in sleep induction more often, whereas GABAB may be more associated with active states.112 Although there are some clues for a relation with inhibitory mechanisms, additional research is needed. Sleep-related treatment of DoC patients is not restricted to pharmacological interventions, but can also be done through intervention on the circadian rhythm. This can, for instance, be accomplished by light therapy, that is, regulating light exposure in such a way that it entrains the circadian rhythm. One study piloted this idea and successfully enhanced circadian rhythmicity (i.e., maximum temperature was closer to the optimum of healthy controls) in 3/8 DoC patients which was accompanied with the behavioral improvement of VS/UWS patients being diagnosed with MCS.113 In a follow-up study, it is shown that light therapy improved the fit of body temperature to follow the circadian rhythm, but behavioral improvement was only observed at the trend level and not consistently crossing diagnostic categories.114 In the past, patients have been excluded from studies investigating sleep because light was continuously on in their care environment, acknowledging the potential great influences of the zeitgeber and consequently on sleep.115 Insomnia, as shown to be likely highly prevalent in the DoC population, can be treated relatively effectively using cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in brain-healthy individuals.116 At face value, these therapies may be unsuitable for treatment in a population where cognition and communication are hard to establish, but looking at the content of these therapies hints otherwise. Exemplary is one important component of CBT-I, sleep restriction. Now, most DoC patients get sleep opportunities continuously, whereas more restricted sleep may benefit their (unreported) sleep-related complaints. At least in TBI patients without a DoC, CBT-I has shown increased sleep efficiency in a case study but needs more research.23, 117 From an ethical point of view, some treatments may be invasive and exhausting without benefits and should therefore be applied carefully. To this end, more research is needed to potentially discriminate DoC patients that may benefit from such treatments. Nevertheless, creativity in the separation of day and night (e.g., well-timed physiotherapy, posture changes during the day, for instance, with the aid of a wheelchair, or even changing blankets between day and night) could provide large benefits, whereas negative side effects are not to be expected. Such benefits could potentially be expected from intensive neurorehabilitation programs.118, 119 Treatments for DoC like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been shown to moderately improve consciousness.120 Although precise mechanisms remain unclear, tDCS could work through increasing cortical excitability.121 Cortical excitability can be assessed by applying Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation stimulation and calculating the complexity of the response (i.e., the perturbational complexity index) which has been found to be lower in VS/UWS compared to MCS and to controls.122 Since the level of behavioral consciousness123 and cortical entropy124 fluctuates in DoC patients, a study protocol was recently developed to take these fluctuations into account by incorporating tDCS stimulation in a closed-loop fashion with an EEG recording.125 This approach holds great promise for the improvement of the effectiveness of tDCS and other stimulation techniques. Nonetheless, the cortical excitability as a proposed mechanism of action also has a circadian rhythmicity and as such may fluctuate at another scale.126 It was shown that circadian rhythms are variable in DoC patients,1 hinting that incorporating other circadian measures in such a closed-loop approach may further improve effectiveness. For such an implementation, we should however increase our knowledge of sleep and circadian fluctuations in DoC patients, keeping in mind treatment goals like these. Finally, one study has shown that tDCS reduces evoked slow-wave activity in DoC patients,127 hinting its mechanism of action may also be related to the default activity of cortical neurons. The guidelines by the European Academy of Neurology suggest to perform sleep EEG monitoring as part of the assessment to distinguish between patients in either a UWS or MCS.128 Though this is a weak recommendation with low evidence, others have recently shown the importance of looking into the presence of sleep characteristics in patients with a DoC.1 The suggestion has also been made that this monitoring does not necessarily have to happen through EEG, as actigraphy may provide a suitable alternative.129, 130 This easy-to-use low-impact wristwatch can help track circadian rhythms over multiple days and work showcasing that usefulness in predicting, for instance, when to perform a behavioral assessment is currently under way. In this perspective, we have argued for the likely prominent presence of insomnia in DoC patients. This should be taken into account whenever approaching DoC-related data, and, preferably, strategies should be developed to minimize this. We have also shown that findings across the research spectrum of DoC show similarities with those altered in insomnia, from altered pain perception to altered oddball detection and reduced functional connectivity. We are not necessarily claiming that the DoC research presented here is false in any way, or just finds the effects of insomnia, yet, we do believe that at least for some of these findings, insomnia could play a major role. This begs questions on how much of insomnia is part and parcel of a disorder of consciousness, where the answer is clearly not black or white. Slow waves provide a means of exploring this gray area, in search of common physiology, and distinctions. In turn, treatments may affect insomnia as well as the \"underlying\" DoC and these effect should have a greater presence in literature. The perspective presented here is by no means a systematic review, and we do not cover all possible ground that could be covered on the link between DoC and insomnia. The aim here is to start a discussion on these topics, for instance, by highlighting seminal papers in DoC research (e.g.,36, 41, 42, 45) and highlighting that their main findings have also been found to be affected by insomnia. This should spark further discussion on what insomnia-related deterioration means for the interpretation of DoC research, on how we can expand control for this besides the examples mentioned here, and on how this may influence treatment effects. With that, we hope to open up this unexplored avenue and propel DoC research beyond confounding factors of poor sleep. The take-home message from the observations regarding the consequences of sleep disturbances in DoC is two-fold. First, insomnia symptoms are likely very prevalent in the DoC population. Second, these insomnia complaints may pose additional challenges in evaluating consciousness in DoC patients, may have additional deleterious effects on the health of the patients, and may hinder the recovery process. Thus, investigation of sleep and disturbances in patients with a DoC is paramount. Moreover, efforts to promote healthy sleep should be an integrative part of the treatment and clinical management of DoC patients. Glenn J.

      "abstract": "Age-related functional reserve decline and vulnerability of multiple physiological systems and organs, as well as at the cellular and molecular levels, result in different frailty phenotypes, such as physical, cognitive, and psychosocial frailty, and multiple comorbidities, including age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and/or tinnitus due to the decline in auditory reserve. However, the contributions of chronic non-audiogenic cumulative exposure, and chronic audiogenic stress to phenotypic heterogeneity of presbycusis and/or tinnitus remain elusive. Because of the cumulative environmental stressors throughout life, allostasis systems, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and the sympathetic adrenal–medullary (SAM) axes become dysregulated and less able to maintain homeostasis, which leads to allostatic load and maladaptation. Brain–body communication via the neuroendocrine system promotes systemic chronic inflammation, overmobilization of energetic substances (glucose and lipids), and neuroplastic changes via the non-genomic and genomic actions of glucocorticoids, catecholamines, and their receptors. These systemic maladaptive alterations might lead to different frailty phenotypes and physical, cognitive, and psychological comorbidities, which, in turn, cause and exacerbate ARHL and/or tinnitus with phenotypic heterogeneity. Chronic audiogenic stressors, including aging accompanying ontological diseases, cumulative noise exposure, and ototoxic drugs as well as tinnitus, activate the HPA axis and SAM directly and indirectly by the amygdala, promoting allostatic load and maladaptive neuroplasticity in the auditory system and other vulnerable brain regions, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In the auditory system, peripheral deafferentation, central disinhibition, and tonotopic map reorganization may trigger tinnitus. Cross-modal maladaptive neuroplasticity between the auditory and other sensory systems is involved in tinnitus modulation. Persistent dendritic growth and formation, reduction in GABAergic inhibitory synaptic inputs induced by chronic audiogenic stresses in the amygdala, and increased dendritic atrophy in the hippocampus and mPFC, might involve the enhancement of attentional processing and long-term memory storage of chronic subjective tinnitus, accompanied by cognitive impairments and emotional comorbidities. Therefore, presbycusis and tinnitus are multisystem disorders with phenotypic heterogeneity. Stressors play a critical role in the phenotypic heterogeneity of presbycusis. Differential diagnosis based on biomarkers of metabonomics study, and interventions tailored to different ARHL phenotypes and/or tinnitus will contribute to healthy aging and improvement in the quality of life.",

      "abstract": ": There is an increasing number of patients worldwide with sleep disturbances and diabetes. Various sleep disorders, including long or short sleep duration and poor sleep quality of numerous causes, may increase the risk of diabetes. Some symptoms of diabetes, such as painful peripheral neuropathy and nocturia, or associated other sleep disorders, such as sleep breathing disorders or sleep movement disorders, may influence sleep quality and quantity. Both sleep disorders and diabetes may lead to cognitive impairment. The risk of development of cognitive impairment in diabetic patients may be related to vascular and non-vascular and other factors, such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, central insulin resistance, amyloid and tau deposits and other causes. Numerous sleep disorders, e.g., sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, and poor sleep quality are most likely are also associated with cognitive impairment. Adequate functioning of the system of clearance of the brain from toxic substances, such as amyloid β, i.e. glymphatic system, is related to undisturbed sleep and prevents cognitive impairment. In the case of coexistence, sleep disturbances and diabetes either independently lead to and/or mutually aggravate cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "A functional disorder is a medical condition that impairs the normal function, but without major organic cause such as irritation or inflammation and where the organ or part of the body looks completely normal under medical examination. The accumulation of abnormalities that limit body functions is a major risk factor for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), defined as a gastrointestinal disorder with abdominal pain or discomfort that is associated with a change in bowel habit. Often, this disorder is accompanied by the concomitant decline in cognitive or motor performance. Pain that in some patients is out of proportion to identifiable pathology is the most immediate and dramatic consequence of IBS and is responsible for a highly negative impact on quality of life and substantial workforce loss. For patients with IBS, the most common comorbid diagnoses include painful bladder syndrome (PBS) or chronic pelvic pain (CPP). Cells of the affected tissues may interact in cell-to-cell manner messages through the transfer of hormones, cytokines, and other mediators that influence normal functioning. The complex interplay and balance between these diverse mediators, ageing, genetic background, and environmental factors may ultimately determine the outcome of the progression of the functional disorder. On a cellular level, these responses are highly complex, involving a vast array of enzymes and receptors of virtually every class, directing recruitment of many types of cells to recover the healthy state. Indeed, a balance between the messengers with the inherent redundancy of the different body systems makes therapeutic intervention of functional disorders a considerable challenge.",

However, the influence of noise on the vegetative functions is not so clear. In addition to existing investigations on vegetative functional disturbances, the role of noise as a risk factor has to be determined and its effects have to be quantified. The significance of noise‐induced sleep disturbances in relation to health and well‐being, is also controversial. The hypothesized causal connection between acoustical stimulation and the occurrence of disorders, includes primary‐effects (e.g. awakenings) and after‐effects (e.g. changes in mood or performance). To date, it has not been feasible to determine late after‐effects, such as health disorders. The most often reported sociopsychological effect of noise is general annoyance, whereby annoyance is defined as disturbance of communication, rest, recreation or concentration. Some results indicate a higher sensitivity of critical groups (e.g. old people, the sick, children, pregnant women).",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is one of the anxiety disorders, characterized by sudden and unexpected attacks of panic. Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Common Mental Disorders such as depression in late life are not well understood or acknowledged either by the community or the medical profession in India for three important reasons. First, recognition of common mental disorders as a psychiatric problem in general is relatively poor. Secondly, the relative proportion of elders is less than 5% for most Indian communities; this demographic situation is bound to change in the future with predictions that the oldest sector of the population will exceed 100 million over the next 20 years. The third reason is the fatalistic attitude toward aging in India, which mandates that elderly persons accept their physical and mental condition as a normal part of old age. The common presenting complaints of depression are somatic; on inquiry, however, most depressed elders will admit to cognitive and emotional symptoms typical of depression. The hallmark cognitive feature is anhedonia. Co-morbidity with physical ill-health is common. Risk factors for depression include low education, poverty, social isolation and family discord. The latter is on the rise as a result of the breakdown of traditional community structures because of the massive migration of younger productive members of families to urban areas and reduced economic activity in rural areas. The commonest treatments in primary care are symptomatic. Research into the treatments for depression, integrating the subject of depression into training programs for community and general health workers and collaborating with Non-Governmental Organisations are key factors in meeting mental health needs of elders.",

Evidence suggests that sleep disturbances are one of the risk factors that predict an increased risk for suicidal behaviors. Both sleep disorders and general sleep complaints are linked to higher levels of suicidal ideation and depression, as well as increased rates of suicide and suicide attempts. The causal mechanism of this association is not clear. For example, it is not known if insomnia is an independent phenomenon that if interrupted could prevent the emergence of a mental disorder, or if insomnia is a symptom of another developing illness. Hypofrontality, HPA dysfunction, and an impaired serotonergic system are potential mechanisms underlying the association of sleep disturbances and suicidal behavior.

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is the propensity to have recurrent and unprovoked seizures; this propensity can result from a number of underlying aetiologies. Epilepsy is thus best considered a symptom of an underlying brain disorder. A single seizure is not usually considered sufficient to make a diagnosis of epilepsy. Epileptic seizures occurring solely in association with precipitants or triggering factors are termed acute symptomatic or situation-related seizures. Partial seizures arise from a localized region of cerebral cortex. The clinical manifestations of a partial seizure depend on where in the cortex it begins, and how fast and how far it spreads. Complex partial seizures frequently present as altered or 'automatic' behaviour. The patient may pluck at his or her clothes, fiddle with objects and act in a confused manner. Lip smacking or chewing movements, grimacing, undressing, the carrying out of purposeless activities or of aimless wandering may all occur on their own or in different combinations.",

These disorders can range from having vocalizations and minor movements to very complex and aggressive behaviors that result in serious injury and disruption of sleep for the patients and the bed partners. Parasomnias need careful clinical history-taking often followed by a sleep lab study to rule out other sleep disorders. Parasomnias can frequently be mistaken as nocturnal manifestations of psychiatric disorders, which makes it very important for psychiatrists to have a proper understanding of these sleep disorders.

Despite the large amount now known about sleep problems, health professionals are still insufficiently trained in preventing, assessing and treating sleep disorders. Changes at puberty halt the previous steady reduction of sleep during childhood. Adolescence may bring particular sleep problems such as delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), which is common in teenagers. Late-night social or other activities make it physiologically impossible to get to sleep, leading to insufficient sleep and sleep debt which, if unrecognised or incorrectly diagnosed and left untreated, may cause daytime sleepiness and underfunctioning. General practitioners, health visitors and school nurses can help by being better informed about sleep disorders, their identification and treatment, and being ready to refer complex problems to specialist centres.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "abstract": "Headache pain impacts most of the population at some point in life, at an enormous cost to day-to-day functioning. Determination of the variables that are associated with prevalence and severity of headaches has been inconsistent. One area that deserves more attention is the relationship between headaches and sleep. For instance, several sleep parameters may precipitate or exacerbate headaches, but previous research often used inconsistent and limited assessments of both headaches and sleep, making results difficult to interpret and compare. The current study seeks to extend previous research by using more comprehensive and empirically validated assessment techniques to study the relationship between sleep and headaches in a healthy sample. Greater self-reported sleep quality is related to lower headache frequency and severity, and lower self-reported sleep quality is characteristic of individuals having migraine-type headaches. Greater sleep efficiency is related to lower headache severity and shorter headache duration. Greater sleep onset latency is related to longer headache duration and greater headache severity. Greater number of nighttime awakenings is related to greater headache severity and is characteristic of individuals having a diagnosable headache disorder (either tension-type or migraine-type). Stress appeared to be a partial mediator between self-reported sleep quality and headache severity. Further experimental studies may clarify causality between sleep and headache.",

      "title": "FOXP2-Related Speech and Language Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristicsAll FOXP2-related speech and language disorders, regardless of the underlying genetic alteration, have a core phenotype: childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), a disorder of speech motor programming or planning that affects the production, sequencing, timing, and stress of sounds, syllables, and words. All individuals with CAS – whether caused by an alteration of FOXP2 or of an unknown cause – have difficulties in automatically and accurately sequencing speech sounds into syllables, syllables into words, and words into sentences with the correct prosody. Additional findings in FOXP2-related speech and language disorders can include oral motor dyspraxia (difficulty planning or programming oral movements on command); dysarthria (a neuromuscular-based speech disorder that may affect nasal resonance, voice quality, prosody, and breath support for speech); moderate to severe receptive and expressive language disorder; and reading and spelling impairments. The underlying genetic cause of FOXP2-related speech and language disorders is either disruption of FOXP2 only (referred to in this GeneReview as FOXP2-only-related speech and language disorder) or large copy number variants (i.e., contiguous gene deletions), structural variants (i.e., chromosome translocation or inversion), or maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (UPD7) involving FOXP2 (here referred to as FOXP2-plus speech and language disorders). The genetic alteration determines if only speech and language problems are present (FOXP2-only-related speech and language disorder) or if more global developmental and behavioral issues are likely to be present as well (FOXP2-plus speech and language disorder). In FOXP2-only-related disorders, nonverbal (performance) IQ is typically more preserved compared to verbal IQ. Fine motor skills may be impaired (e.g., buttoning clothes, tying shoelaces), yet gross motor skills are normal. Autistic features and dysmorphic findings have been reported in a few affected individuals. In FOXP2-plus-related disorders oral motor deficits, global developmental delay, and autism spectrum disorder are common.Diagnosis/testingThe diagnosis of a FOXP2-related speech and language disorder is established in a proband by detection of one of the following: A large non-recurrent contiguous gene deletion that includes FOXP2 (52% of affected individuals). A sequence variant within FOXP2 (~29%). Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (UPD7) that reduces FOXP2 expression (~11%). A structural variant (e.g., chromosome translocation, inversion) that disrupts FOXP2 (~8%).ManagementTreatment of manifestations: Optimally management of the speech and/or language disorder is determined by a speech pathologist based on the individual's findings (typically: presence and severity of CAS, dysarthria, language deficits, and literacy impairments). A clinical psychologist or neuropsychologist may provide strategies to help manage deficits in specific cognitive domains and an occupational therapist and physiotherapist can provide strategies to help with fine and gross motor deficits, respectively. Surveillance: Follow-up evaluations with standardized tests by a speech and language pathologist. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Clarification of the genetic status of pre-symptomatic relatives at risk identifies as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt evaluation for speech and language disorders and initiation of treatment.Genetic counselingRecurrence risk for sibs of proband with a FOXP2-related speech and language disorder depends on the genetic alteration: Non-recurrent contiguous gene deletions (80% are de novo and the remainder are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner) FOXP2 sequence variants (~70% are de novo and the remainder are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner) Maternal UPD7 (no increased risk to sibs) A structural variant (e.g., chromosome translocation, inversion. If one parent has a structural variant, the risk to sibs is increased and depends on the specific structural variant.) Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible if the causative genetic alteration has been identified in an affected family member.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Proper amount of sleep has a critical role in biological processes and overall health and is linked to negative health outcomes, such as diabetes, heart disease, brain stroke, weight changes, pain, mood swings, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive health, chromo-some changes etc. Despite dedicating one-third of our lives to sleep, a substantial por-tion of the world's population faces sleep deprivation. Insufficient sleep goes beyond simple tiredness, and it is affecting humans metabolic, cardiovascular, cognitive, and emotional dimensions. When it comes to physical activity and athletic performance, sleep deprivation manifests in compromised reaction time, accuracy, vigour, sub-maximal strength, and endurance. These challenges also affect athlete’s cognitive functions such as judgment and decision-making. In the context of athletic perfor-mance, even partial sleep deprivation can lead to significant impairments. Relation-ship between sleep and physical activity was found as emphasizing the importance of adequate sleep for optimal performance and shows that good sleep hygiene and rec-ommended amount of physical activity really go hand in hand contributing to overall well-being including physiological and mental health.

Many patients are found in bed or in the bedroom at the time of their death. Autonomic nervous system responses leading to fatal arrhythmias during changes in the sleep-wake cycle have been described in nonepileptic patients. Increased sympathetic tone alone can cause microscopic ischemic cardiac lesions or neurogenic pulmonary edema that may lead to death. In epilepsy, both partial and generalized seizures are associated with changes in autonomic function. These seizures are frequently more common in sleep. Finally, the younger population, who tends to be less compliant, has a higher rate of death.",

Extreme situations often produce hypnagogic states, like situations of war or near-death states or near coma states. Usually, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena are not indicative of dysfunctional or pathological processes. But when they last longer than usual, they may be indicative of a state where sleeping instead of being a container for the mind has turned into something scary or threatening. This is when sub-thalamic fears may appear. Primitive mental states usually follow these feelings and require a good deal of imagination to put all the split experiences together. The way the container functions is related to the initial experiences of life with the mother.",

Sleep onset can be correlated with behavioral and biological changes that occur over a short period of time.

Behavioral changes also consist of modulation in responsiveness to auditory and visual stimuli, decrease in the ability to perform and complete simple tasks, motor restlessness, mood changes, impulsivity, and varying degrees of attention problems. Although biological changes in electrocardiography (EEG) activity commonly associated with transitional sleep may be recorded, they are typically perceived by the child as sleepiness.1",

      "title": "Mental Work Blocks and the Galvanic Skin Response",
      "abstract": "An important aspect of the study of mental work and fatigue is the relation of the concomitant physiological processes and the mental work processes. The central problems of such a study are whether, and in what manner, the concomitant physiological processes reflect the mental performance decrement, and whether the concomitance is coincident or causally related. A specific problem is the study of the physiological processes which occur at the time of momentary faltering of the mental work processes. The so-called mental block, which makes its appearance as a momentary slowing up of work performance, is accompanied by physiological reactions which often observably change at the incidence of blocking. The galvanic skin response is a physiological reaction which often occurs during mental work blocking. What is the relationship between the mental block phenomenon and the galvanic skin response? The most outstanding phenomenon of continuous mental work is the work efficiency decrement. Second in objectivity and importance is the fluctuating variation of mental work efficiency, the involuntary failure of the responding mechanism of mental work in maintaining a constant efficiency. Fluctuating variations in mental work efficiency are manifested in changing facility of responding to the task of the mental work. Involuntary blocks or block periods appear in rather regular order meshed in between normal and heightened efficiency. The blocks appear as slower responses and may appear as a single slow response or as a group of slow responses following and followed by normal responses. The phenomenon of blocking has been extensively studied by Bills. (3). The causal mechanism of blocking is probably refraction of the response neuro-behavior system, as suggested by Bills. The vague term neuro-behavior system is here used because we do not know the exact nature of the causal mechanism. However, as Bills (1) has demonstrated, blocking occurrence is influenced by changes in the subject's available oxygen supply. This chemical relationship suggests that blocking and nervous refraction are similar in action. Some light may be cast upon the causal mechanism of blocking by a study of the autonomic nervous system changes occurring during blocking. The autonomic changes may be partially reflected in the occurrence of the galvanic skin response, a sweat gland phenomenon mediated through the para-sympathetic system. To this end, a study was made of the relation of the occurrence of G.S.R.s and blocks or block periods.",

      "abstract": "Patients in a vegetative state seem to be awake with their eyes open but show no evidence of awareness.1 They do not interact with others and make no purposeful or voluntary responses to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli. They are able to breathe spontaneously, and they retain their gag, cough, sucking, and swallowing reflexes. Sleep-wake cycles are preserved, and so are the hypothalamic and brain stem autonomic responses. They are incontinent of urine and faeces, but they may retain their cranial nerve, spinal, and primitive reflexes. Inconsistent non-purposive movements occur, notably facial grimacing and chewing; they make sounds; and they may show inconsistent auditory and oculomotor orienting reflexes to peripheral sounds or movement. The diagnosis of a vegetative state is not tenable if there is any degree of voluntary movement, sustained visual pursuit, consistent and reproducible visual fixation, or response to threatening gestures.2 3\n\nThe condition is distinct from coma, in which patients have their eyes closed and lack sleep-wake cycles, and from the “locked-in” syndrome, in which patients are aware of themselves and their environment but have lost motor function and speech, communication being achieved by eye movement or blinks.

      "title": "Cardiorespiratory synchronisation in infants during sleep",
      "abstract": "Cardiorespiratory coupling, an interaction between cardiovascular and respiratory system, is a vital phenomenon in human life for providing gas exchange in a manner responsive to varying physiological and metabolic demands. Analysis of the degree of cardiorespiratory coupling, which characterises the relationship between heart rate and respiratory signal, might provide useful information of maturational process and cardiorespiratory control in infants. Sleep is an ideal condition to investigate cardiorespiratory coupling, as during sleep the body is under the control of the autonomic nervous system and cardiorespiratory coupling is tightly regulated with stable breathing patterns. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a group of disorders characterised by ventilation disorders, in which a partial or complete cessation of breathing appears repeatedly during sleep, resulting in daytime sleepiness or fatigue and reduces the quality of life. SDB is significant during the first year of life and could lead to many serious health problems in infants. Although polysomnography, a sophisticated test involving many physiological signals is considered to be a “gold standard” tool for monitoring sleep and diagnosing SDB, it has several limitations. The PSG signals are often interpreted visually and separately; and there is no routine approach for experts to relate information from the PSG signals. Hence, the information of the cardiorespiratory coupling, which is obtained from visual interpretation of PSG signals, is limited. This thesis, therefore, developed and validated a signal processing technique to characterise cardiorespiratory coupling in infants during sleep. Three major studies were undertaken. A pilot study assessed the ability of conventional phase synchronisation technique, which is a promising approach to characterise cardiorespiratory coupling. The technique was applied to a cohort of 34 healthy infants at two weeks, three months and six months of age, to assess the maturational changes and cardiorespiratory dynamics around sleep apnea associated with sigh (a spontaneous augmented breath). Our results showed that the cardiorespiratory synchronisation and respiratory modulation of heart rate reduced around sighs followed by a central apnea, compared to sighs followed by a pause. Cardiorespiratory synchronisation was increased at three months and six months of age compared to two-week infants. The findings of this study suggest that cardiorespiratory synchronisation might be a leading marker of changes in cardiorespiratory control, preceding central apneas associated with sighs. The second study developed a semi-automated technique to detect and quantify cardiorespiratory synchronisation in noisy and chaotic data, based on a phase synchronisation technique. A limitation of the phase synchronisation technique is the requirement of pre-selection of a phase locking ratio, which can be found only by trial and error. The proposed technique solved this problem by exploiting recurrence plot analysis, which is a well-established tool for characterising recurring patterns and nonstationarities in experiments. The result demonstrated that by embedding the phase information of the synchrogram into phase space, the phase locking ratio was automatically revealed as the number of attractors in the phase space. This feature enables the automated detection of any phase locking ratio with just one single construction of synchrogram. The technique was validated using several mathematical toy models, and simulated and measured cardiorespiratory data from infants. In the third study, the ability to characterise cardiorespiratory coupling of our developed technique was investigated by applying it to the data of 34 healthy infants and 82 infants with chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD) at two weeks, three months and six months of life. CNLD is the most common form of chronic lung disease in infancy. These CNLD infants require supplemental oxygen, and the determination of the oxygen level is currently based on very basic measurements such as infants’ birth weight, age, and so on. Hence, this study, also aims to provide a better understanding of cardiorespiratory synchronisation in CNLD and healthy infants as well as the effect of supplemental oxygen on cardiorespiratory coupling in these infants. Our results showed that cardiorespiratory synchronisation increased with supplemental oxygen in CNLD infants, who are less than six months of age towards the normal level of healthy infants, suggesting the benefits of supplemental oxygen to these infants. The finding also demonstrated that cardiorespiratory synchronisation characterised by our developed technique could be a useful tool to discriminate different pathological/physiological conditions in infants during sleep. In addition, to validate the results of our developed technique, we applied a heart rate variability analysis using time domain variable pNNx, which is a well-established tool for discriminating health from diseased condition, to the same data of healthy and CNLD infants. We found an increase of heart rate variability with supplemental oxygen in CNLD infants who are less than six months of age, towards the value of healthy infants. This result supports previous findings of our cardiorespiratory synchronisation technique. In conclusion, the analysis of cardiorespiratory synchronisation is a unique approach to analyse cardiorespiratory control in infants during sleep. This analysis could be applied to sleep studies to provide both visual and quantitative measures of cardiorespiratory coupling in infants. Cardiorespiratory synchronisation appears to provide useful information on maturational processes and changes in autonomic control during different physiological/pathological states.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

The causes of SB range from psychosocial factors to an excessive sleep arousal response. Some studies showed that SB episodes during sleep are under the influences of transient activity of the brainstem arousal. Nocturnal groaning (NG) is a parasomnia characterized by an expiratory monotonous vocalization occurring during sleep, especially in REM sleep and during the second half of the night. The pathogenesis of NG remains still unclear and many hypotheses arose, ranging from the persistence of a vestigial ventilatory pattern rather than an expiratory upper airways' obstruction. Sleep microstructure fluctuation might modulate the NG, since the end of the NG episode usually is synchronized with a cortical arousal and an autonomic activation. Further studies should clarify the pathophysiology of SB and NG, especially when the two phenomena are associated.",

Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term, uncorrected disturbances of circadian rhythms lead to clinically significant distress and cause mental, physical, social, professional, educational, or other functional impairments [6].",

Some groups are at particularly high risk of such problems, such as those with a learning disability or other kind of medical or psychological disorder. There are many ways in which consistently disturbed sleep can affect children, both psychologically and sometimes physically; their emotional state, behaviour, and learning are likely to be affected. To establish the true nature and cause of a sleep problem, systematic enquiries need to be made (starting with the family doctor or his team) about certain key aspects of the situation; in some cases, additional information will be required from special further investigations.",

      "title": "Commentary: Obstructive sleep apnoea as a risk factor for glaucoma",
      "abstract": "Sleep apnea is a type of sleep-disordered breathing that causes intermittent pauses in breathing during sleep, leading to transient nocturnal hypoxia and hypercapnia. Polysomnography is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most common type, is due to complete or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep. Recurrent hypoxia due to desaturation and consequent arousal has several systemic effects affecting blood pressure, insulin resistance, autonomic dysfunction, and systemic inflammation.[1] Its severity is determined by the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) (total number of apnea and hypopnea events divided by total sleep time), based on which it is classified as mild, moderate, and severe OSA.[2] It is associated with increasing age and obesity, making it epidemiologically relevant due to an aging populace and rampant lifestyle disorders in most countries today.[3] The ocular diseases most frequently associated with OSA are floppy eyelid syndrome, nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, glaucoma, central serous retinopathy, retinal vascular disorders, and dry eye disease. The relationship between OSA and glaucoma has been the subject of many studies. It is of specific interest as another modifiable risk factor in glaucoma, besides IOP. It assumes importance in normal pressure glaucoma (NPG) and progressive glaucoma, despite adequate IOP control. A meta-analysis of cross-sectional and case-control studies showed an increased prevalence of glaucoma among OSA patients (pooled odds ratio (OR): 1.242, P < 0.001) and OSA diagnosis in glaucoma patients (pooled OR: 1.746, P = 0.002).[4] More importantly, a thinner retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), lower ganglion cell complex thickness (GCC) on optical coherence tomography, and decreased vessel density of superficial and deep-layer peripapillary and macular area on optical coherence tomography angiography are reported in patients with greater OSA severity (higher AHI).[56] The current study also provides evidence of thinner RNFL and GCC with OSA compared to normal controls in Indians.[7] However, the exact pathophysiology of RNFL and GCC loss is unclear. There are multiple theories: (i) increased IOP due to supine posture, increased episcleral venous pressure, and autonomic dysfunction; (ii) optic nerve ischemia due to recurrent hypoxia; and (iii) vascular dysregulation at the optic nerve.[8] All of them remain to be proven. Other facts to be considered are that OSA patients are likely to have other comorbidities, such as ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Vascular diseases, in particular, are likely to be independent risk factors for glaucoma. There is some evidence that vascular factors may be responsible for OSA-related damage in NPG. Chuang et al.[6] reported decreased vessel density of the superficial and deep-layer peripapillary and macular area in OSA patients with NPG and perimetric damage. Evaluation of the role of vascular dysregulation and peripheral hypoxia in OSA-related glaucoma would require prospective cohort studies in OSA patients. Though a clear relationship exists between OSA and NPG, high-pressure primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is also reported.[8] From a clinical standpoint, evaluating additional risk factors for glaucoma becomes essential in patients with rapidly progressive glaucoma (despite adequate control) and NPG. Thus, there may be a case for OSA evaluation by polysomnography, where indicated, in these patients. Obstructive sleep apnea treatment is lifestyle modification and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, which may mitigate early glaucoma. There may be concerns about IOP variations with CPAP. However, Lin et al.[9] demonstrated some reversal of structural and functional changes after short-term (3 months) CPAP therapy. Thus, early and appropriate intervention in OSA-related glaucoma may be beneficial. Normal pressure glaucoma has a greater reported proportion among Asian (46.9%–92.3% of POAG) as compared to Western (30.0%–57.1% of POAG) countries, with similar data from South India (82%).[10] Thus, from an epidemiological standpoint, it would be important to study risk factors related to NPG in different populations. The estimated prevalence of OSA in India varies from 4.4% to 13.7% and is likely to rise with an aging population and increasing lifestyle diseases.[11] The current study is the first one from India that provides data regarding RNFL and ganglion cell complex changes in OSA.[7] Similar and extensive studies related to OSA and other potentially modifiable risk factors of glaucoma are the need of the hour.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews recent literature which suggests that sleep disturbance in members of the general population, whether or not they have ever had a formal psychiatric disorder, is a risk factor for the onset of a formal psychiatric diagnosis at a later time. Based upon the current literature, the strongest link is between subjective insomnia, lasting at least 2 weeks, and the later onset of depression. Less well-established data suggest that lifetime reports of at least 2 weeks of insomnia, hypersomnia, or both hypersomnia and insomnia, are risk factors for the later development of depression, anxiety disorders or substance abuse. More tentatively, preliminary data suggest that increasing subjective sleep disturbance may signal a relapse in remitted depressed patients. Sleep disturbances are common manifestations of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Therefore, sleep complaints may be among the most robust prodromal symptoms reflecting partial depressive or anxiety disorders, which eventually declare themselves as full-blown clinical episodes.",

Sleep disorders can be caused by either a primary disorder of a mechanism controlling sleep or inadequate function of an end organ, such as the upper airways and lungs. Understanding the physiology and pattern of normal sleep is an important foundation for interpreting the clinical symptoms, signs, and neurophysiological abnormalities observed in patients with sleep disorders. The term polysomnography refers to the simultaneous recording of multiple sleep parameters, including a limited electroencephalogram, respiratory parameters, chest excursion, limb movements, and the electrocardiogram. Polysomnography is important for assessing a variety of sleep disturbances, including disorders such as sleep-related breathing disorders (including obstructive sleep apnea), rapid eye movement behavior disorder, and periodic movements of sleep. The multiple sleep latency test and maintenance of wakefulness test are studies that are especially useful in the evaluation of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias.",

      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4. Endometriosis Adhesions (chronic pelvic inflammatory disease/previous pelvic surgery) Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts/dermoids Pelvic congestion syndrome Adenomyosis Malignancy. Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

      "title": "Damages derived from mobbing and professional contingencies—state of the art on the Portuguese legal framework and case law",
      "abstract": "Mobbing is a topic that has gained an increasing importance, due to escalating numbers of cases that are reported and go back to courts. This phenomenon may be characterised as a set of intimidating, humiliating or embarrassing, harmful or unwanted conducts of various kinds, occurring in the context of an employment relationship, that objectively violate the fundamental rights of the worker, namely, his dignity and physical and moral integrity (Pereira, 2009, p. 72). Moreover, a systematization of these behaviours is demanded: the repetition of the offensive conduct, which should be extended in time, but also the combination of several acts that complement each other in achieving the purpose it was intended1. Therefore, mobbing may cause damage to the physical and psychological health of workers2. Indeed, it is responsible for cognitive, psychological, psychosomatic and hormonal changes, as regards the nervous system, muscle tension and sleep, and may ultimately lead to suicide. In September 2012, the Portuguese Health authorities changedon the article (art.) 28 of the Portuguese Labour Code (Law nr. 7/2009, 12-02-hereinafter only CT) not adequate and sufficient? The convenience of this research lies not only with the advantages that the institutes of professional contingencies3 may adduce for the analysis of this matter, but also with the need to give adequate treatment to the figure of mobbing, which has worryingly gained an increasing dimension.",

      "title": "THE EFFECTS OF INDUCED SLEEP FRAGMENTATION ON CARDIAC SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE",
      "abstract": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea (OSAH) is a prevalent disorder that occurs in about 5% of the middle-aged adult population. Comprised of repetitive episodes of complete and/or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep, OSAH results in cyclic oxyhemoglobin desaturation-resaturation (e.g. intermittent hypoxia) and arousal from sleep (sleep fragmentation). Consequences of OSAH include increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and elevated sympathetic activity (SA) during daytime wakefulness as well as sleep.This has potential clinical relevance because heightened SA is thought to be one mechanism explaining the association between OSAH and cardiovascular disease. Although OSAH is associated with increased sympathetic contribution to cardiac sympatho-vagal balance (SVB), the pathway mediating this effect (intermittent hypoxia, sleep fragmentation (SF) or both) is unclear. Because obstructive upper airway events in OSAH patients precipitate both physiologic phenomena in a generally concomitant manner, it has been difficult to sort the individual contributions of each in clinical populations.The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between SVB and experimentally induced SF including examination of the possible interaction with being overweight in a healthy non-OSAH population. Twenty-nine subjects entered into a 4 night / 3 day sleep study to evaluate the effect of experimentally induced SF. Subjects provided a spectrum of body mass index (BMI) ranging from normal to overweight. Subjects experienced two nights of undisturbed sleep followed by two nights of fragmented sleep. Awake SVB reflected by heart rate variability was measured during wakefulness before and after a night of undisturbed sleep and a night of fragmented sleep. Sleep duration and architecture were assessed under both sleep conditions. SVB was decreased by transient changes from awake to sleep. SVB was affected by SF on an undisturbed night, but not a disturbed night. BMI had no effect. The public health significance of this study was that both OSAH and increased SVB have increased risk of cardiovascular disease; through improved understanding of the relationship between particular components of OSAH (SF or oxygenation-reoxygenation cycle) and increased SVB could lead to improved treatment of OSAH and the reduction of cardiovascular disease in the population.",

      "abstract": "Many and varied are the feelings and sensations described as vertigo, but in general they fall into one or the other of two main patterns: the rotatory or turning vertigos and the tactile vertigos. As turning vertigo is nearly always a sign of disturbed vestibular function and tactile vertigo may also at times be of vestibular origin, it is fitting that they should peculiarly interest members of our specialty. The vestibular mechanism has two distinctive functions or reactions. These reactions are vertigo and nystagmus, and whenever a vestibular mechanism is irritated these reactions can be obtained. The vestibular mechanism may also concern itself with other reactions, such as past pointing and disturbances in equilibrium, but it does not actually cause these reactions in the same way in which it causes nystagmus and vertigo, for they are the distinctive reactions of this mechanism. Turning or rotatory vertigo is the most",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are a frequent reason for pediatric consultation. When the disturbance persists in the form of delays in entering or maintaining sleep (DIMS), a vicious cycle develops. As part of the cycle, vigilance or arousal occurs, further inhibiting sleep occurrence. Persistent DIMS requires treatment to interrupt this self-perpetuating sequence. Interruption requires reduction in psychophysiological arousal and deconditioning of the events surrounding sleep. Electromyographic (EMG) and thermal biofeedback in conjunction with relaxation training were used with three children who maintained high levels of arousal resulting from stresses common to their developmental stages. Within seven sessions, all three patients showed attenuation of arousal and symptom abatement marked by uninterrupted sleep.",
