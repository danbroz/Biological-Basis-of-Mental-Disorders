      "title": "Quadri internistici ed endocrinologici connessi alla disabilitŕ grave",
      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;O termo comprometimento cognitivo leve (CCL) designa um quadro clínico em que ocorre declínio em um ou mais domínios cognitivos, o que pode levar a um relativo prejuízo da capacidade de realização de atividades mais complexas (por exemplo, atividades no campo profissional), sem que o indivíduo preencha critérios diagnósticos para demência. O CCL pode ter diversas etiologias, incluindo doenças clínicas mal controladas, polimedicação, depressão, etc; no entanto, em muitos casos corresponde a um estágio ainda incipiente de alguma forma de demência, como a doença de Alzheimer ou demência vascular. Indivíduos com CCL podem apresentar melhora do quadro, estabilização, ou progressão para demência, de acordo com a causa subjacente. O diagnóstico de CCL é baseado em critérios clínicos, e os exames subsidiários tem por objetivo identificar causas tratáveis e tentar identificar os indivíduos com maior risco de conversão para demência. O tratamento é orientado para a doença subjacente ao quadro, quando esta pode ser identificada. Reabilitação cognitiva pode apresentar resultados favoráveis no tratamento de déficits específicos, como os de atenção e memória.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "title": "Functional (Psychogenic) Cognitive Disorders: A Perspective from the Neurology Clinic",
      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "abstract": "DSM-IV kategoriju „delirij, demencija, amnesticki i drugi kognitivni u DSM-5 zamijenila je kategorija„neurokognitivni koja obuhvaca skupinu poremecaja cija je glavna karakteristika steceni klinicki deficit u kognitivnoj funkciji uz smanjenje ranije dostignute razine funkcioniranja. Kategorija „neurokognitivni dijeli se u tri cjeline: delirij, veliki neurokognitivni poremecaj, blagi neurokognitivni poremecaj. Delirij se prema DSM-5 dijagnosticira na temelju smetnje pažnje i svijesti (smetnje svijesti u DSM-IV) uz prisutnost neke dodatne smetnje kognicije, nastaje tijekom kratkog vremenskog razdoblja radi intoksikacije psihoaktivnom tvari/lijekom, zbog sindroma sustezanja od psihoaktivne tvari/lijeka ili zbog drugog, zdravstvenog stanja i ove se smetnje ne mogu objasniti nekim drugim neurorazvojnim poremecajem koji je od ranije prisutan ili je u razvoju. Veliki i blagi neurokognitivni poremecaji mogu biti razvrstani u etioloske podtipove (Aizheimefova bolest, degeneracija frontotemporalnog režnja, bolest Lewyjevih tjeiesaca, nanulama bolest, traumatska ozljeda mozga, uzimanje psihoaktivnetvari/lijeka, infekcija HlV-om, Prionska bolest, Parkinsonova bolest, Huntingtonova bolest, zbog drugog zdravstvenog stanja, visestruke etiologije, nespecificiran). Veliki neurokognitivm u DSM-5 jednim je djelom zamijenio naziv demencija premda ne iskljucuje koristenje naziva demencija, posebice unutar etioloskih podtipova u kojima je on uobicajen (degenerativne demencije kod osoba starije životne dobi). Prema DSM-5 naziv velikog neurokognitivnogporemecaja primjereniji je od naziva demencija kod osoba sa znacajnim ostecenjem koje može biti u samo jednoj kognitivnoj domeni („Amnesticki poremecaj u DSM-IV), a koji se u DSM-5 dijagnosticira kao veliki neurokognitivni zbog drugog zdravstvenog stanja (deficit tiamina povezan s ovisnoscu o alkoholu, hipoksija, infarkt, encefalitis...). Naziv neurokognitivni ima prednost i kod osoba mlađe životne dobi kod kojih je doslo do ostecenja kognitivnog funkcioniranja nakon, primjerice, traumatske ozljede mozga ili HIV infekcije. Dok su za dijagnozu velikog neurokognitivnog poremecaja potrebni dokazi o znacajno smanjenoj kogniciji u odnosu na ranije u jednoj ili vise kognitivnih domena uz nemogucnost neovisnog obavljanja svakodnevnih aktivnosti, za dijagnozu blagog neurokognitivnog poremecaja treba biti prisutna umjereno smanjena kognicija u odnosu na ranije u jednoj ili vise kognitivnih domena koji ne ometaju neovisnost u svakodnevnim aktivnostima, ali prilikom kojih je potreban povecan napor, prilagodba ili kompenzacijske strategije.",

      "abstract": "Las epilepsias mioclónicas progresivas (EMP) son enfermedades neurodegenerativas infrecuentes, clínica y genéticamente heterogéneas, caracterizadas por presentar mioclonías de acción, crisis epilépticas y deterioro neurológico progresivo. Afectan principalmente a niños y adolescentes. Su cuadro clínico inicial dificulta un adecuado diagnóstico diferencial con otras enfermedades neurológicas genéticas más frecuentes como la epilepsia mioclónica juvenil. Se sabe que la mayoría de mutaciones genéticas que causan estas enfermedades reflejan una herencia autosómica recesiva, con variantes dominante o mitocondrial de excepcional frecuencia. El diagnóstico tiene lugar cuando se identifican las mutaciones en un paciente con un cuadro clínico característico (como es el caso de la enfermedad de Unverritch-Lundborg o la EMP del Mar del Norte). Por otro lado, en algunos casos son más útiles la anatomía patológica (para la enfermedad de cuerpos de Lafora o la epilepsia mioclónica con fibras rojas rasgadas) o exámenes auxiliares específicos (vgr., ácido siálico en orina para Sialidosis). Es importante hacer el diagnóstico específico ya que ello permite un tratamiento genético definido para algunas de estas enfermedades. El manejo de las crisis epilépticas incluye el uso de valproato como fármaco de primera línea, en tanto que otros como zonisamida y levetiracetam constituyen una segunda línea; sin embargo, la falta de respuesta al tratamiento médico antiepiléptico es relativamente común. El pronóstico puede variar entre una enfermedad y otra, pero, por lo general, suele ser desfavorable conduciendo a discapacidad severa o muerte temprana.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "title": "Análisis evolutivo y valoración neuropsicológica integral de pacientes con deterioro cognitivo leve o enfermedad de Alzheimer.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION \nEl envejecimiento de la poblacion esta causando un aumento en la aparicion de patologias asociadas a la edad, como es el caso de las demencias. Afortunadamente los avances de las Ciencias de la Salud como la Medicina, la Psicologia y, en particular, la Neuropsicologia estan aportando herramientas de gran utilidad para la evaluacion, el diagnostico y el tratamiento de procesos como el Deterioro Cognitivo Leve (DCL) y la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA).\nEl Deterioro Cognitivo Leve es definido como un sindrome clinico caracterizado por la alteracion adquirida en una o mas areas cognitivas (atencion, funciones ejecutivas, lenguaje, memoria o area visuoespacial) con una duracion de meses a anos, que sin cumplir los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia excede a lo esperado por la edad. La afectacion es referida por el propio paciente o por un informador y debe ser objetivada en la exploracion neuropsicologica, pudiendo provocar una interferencia minima en el desarrollo de las actividades habituales. El DCL es frecuentemente ubicado en un continuo que transcurre desde el envejecimiento normal hasta la enfermedad de Alzheimer, considerando a las personas con DCL como un grupo poblacional con alto riesgo de padecer posteriormente demencia (predominantemente Enfermedad de Alzheimer).\nLa Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) ha sido la demencia mas estudiada y aunque su evolucion es heterogenea, la afectacion cognoscitiva mas grave en los primeros estadios es la alteracion de la memoria. La EA se caracteriza por un comienzo insidioso, dificultando la discriminacion y la realizacion de un diagnostico temprano. Conforme avanza la enfermedad otras areas cognitivas se ven gravemente afectadas.\n Por tanto, la definicion del perfil clinico y neuropsicologico asociado a las primeras etapas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es crucial para facilitar la deteccion temprana de la enfermedad, establecer el punto de partida para una intervencion adecuada y poder llevar a cabo un seguimiento de la evolucion de manera controlada.\nOBJETIVO\nEn la presente Tesis Doctoral se analiza el perfil neuropsicologico integral y el curso evolutivo de pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve y Enfermedad de Alzheimer en dos estadios, leve y moderado, atendiendo a la capacidad funcional y cognitiva en tres momentos diferentes de su evolucion, al inicio y a los seis y doce meses.\nMATERIAL Y METODOS\nSe han llevado a cabo cinco estudios basados en una metodologia descriptiva transversal (Estudios I-IV) y longitudinal (Estudio V), mediante la exploracion neuropsicologica integral y clinica de una muestra inicial de 116 pacientes de los cuales 72 se han ajustado a los criterios de inclusion en la fase de valoracion basal y 44 en la fase de evolucion. El protocolo de evaluacion ha estado conformado por los siguientes tests de screening, de funcionalidad y de dominio cognitivo especifico: Examen Cognoscitivo MiniMental, Test de los 7 Minutos, Escala de Deterioro Global (GDS), Escala para las Actividades Basicas de la Vida diaria BARTHEL, Escala de sobrecarga del cuidador de ZARIT, Cuestionario de Actividad Funcional (FAQ) de Pfeiffer y diferentes subtests del Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica-Test Barcelona.\nRESULTADOS\nA nivel funcional, el grupo con DCL inicialmente era independiente en el desarrollo de las ABVDs pero conforme ha transcurrido el tiempo han comenzado a requerir cierta supervision en sus actividades. A nivel cognitivo inicialmente han presentado afectacion principal de las funciones ejecutivas, la memoria diferida y la velocidad de procesamiento, manteniendo preservadas a los doce meses de investigacion el resto de las funciones evaluadas aunque con un descenso en la ejecucion a los seis meses en orientacion temporal y fluencia verbal.\nLos pacientes con EAL han presentado dependencia funcional desde el inicio incrementada a los doce meses. A nivel cognitivo, en la valoracion inicial se han encontrado resultados sugerentes de afectacion en las funciones ejecutivas (planificacion y secuenciacion), memoria verbal (inmediata y diferida) y velocidad de procesamiento. A los seis meses han comenzado a verse afectadas las funciones de span atencional, coordinacion motora, denominacion y comprension lectora y a los doce meses la orientacion temporal tambien se ha visto afectada. Los sujetos han preservado algunas funciones como la orientacion espacial, lenguaje (automatico, repeticion de palabras, comprension auditiva), praxias ideomotoras y abstraccion verbal.\nPor ultimo, los sujetos con EAM han mostrado alteracion funcional inicial y afectacion de casi todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas (orientacion temporal y espacial, abstraccion, planificacion y secuenciacion, control mental, span atencional, repeticion de material verbal extenso, fluencia verbal semantica y fonetica, comprension verbal auditiva y lectora, praxias ideomotoras, memoria y velocidad de procesamiento). A los seis meses se ha afectado tambien la orientacion en persona y la denominacion de imagenes. En la ultima evaluacion todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas han estado afectadas a excepcion de la capacidad para repetir palabras conocidas y logatomos y para emitir series automaticas del lenguaje cuando son requeridas en orden directo.\nCONCLUSION\nLos sujetos con DCL han comenzado a presentar alteraciones clinicas que les conducen a sentir limitaciones clinicas considerables y que son percibidas por el propio paciente y por las personas de su entorno. En el caso de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer, la evolucion de la misma termina por causar afectacion de todas las funciones mentales superiores y conduce al paciente a un estado de dependencia donde requieren una ayuda continua cada dia. Ademas las areas que en estadios mas temprano comienzan a alterarse son las que se han observado dramaticamente mas afectadas en estadios mas avanzados (memoria, funciones ejecutivas y velocidad de procesamiento).\nLa evaluacion realizada en esta investigacion ha contibuido a la definicion del perfil neuropsicologico de los pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer en estadio leve y moderado, facilitando la labor de discriminar la afectacion funcional y cognitiva inicial en los tres grupos de estudio.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer, Perfil Neuropsicologico, Evaluacion Neuropsicologica",

      "title": "Syndromes of Brain Dysfunction Presenting with Cognitive Impairment or Behavioral Disturbance: Delirium, Dementia, and Mental Disorders Caused by a General Medical Condition",
      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "abstract": "In old age, cognitive functions decline in comparison to performance earlier in life. Subjective memory complaints often cause anxiety. Patient and informant history taking, along with simple additional cognitive tests are usually sufficient to reassure patients or to initiate further diagnostic work-up. Differential diagnoses include depression, delirium, other psychiatric or neurological disorders, metabolic causes, intoxications or side effects of drugs. Physical examination and laboratory tests generally have limited added value. Main reasons for referral are a suspected treatable cause for cognitive decline (e.g. delirium), focal neurological deficit (e.g. stroke), suspected dementia under the age of 65-70 years, additional complex somatic or psychiatric disorders or further work-up in non-native speaking people.",

      "abstract": "By far, the most common reasons for decline in school performance include anything from psychosocial stressors (divorce, death of a loved one or pet, new school, or bullying) to psychiatric disease (depression). These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW. This means that CP following preterm birth, or brain compromise affecting the motor system, is probably related to a pathomechanism specifically affecting the immature brain, which stresses the importance of gaining insight into the following questions:",

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

      "abstract": "Abstract Several illnesses expressed somatically that do not have clearly demonstrated pathophysiological origin and that are associated with neuropsychological complaints are reviewed. Among them are nonepileptic seizures, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, Persian Gulf War unexplained illnesses, toxic mold and sick building syndrome, and silicone breast implant disease. Some of these illnesses may be associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, but it is not likely that these abnormalities are caused by traditionally defined neurological disease. Instead, the cognitive abnormalities may be caused by a complex interaction between biological and psychological factors. Nonepileptic seizures serve as an excellent model of medically unexplained symptoms. Although nonepileptic seizures clearly are associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, they are not of neurological origin. There is evidence that severe stressors and PTSD are associated with immune system problems, neurochemical changes, and various diseases; these data blur the distinctions between psychological and organic etiologies. Diagnostic problems are intensified by the fact that many patients are poor historians. Patients are prone to omit history of severe stressors and psychiatric problems, and the inability to talk about stressors increases the likelihood of suffering from physiological forms of stress.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "title": "Differential Diagnosis of Dementia",
      "abstract": "The differential diagnosis of dementia is a two-stage process. The first stage is the differentiation of dementia from other causes of cognitive impairment. The differential diagnosis of dementia includes: depression; delirium, drugs; normal ageing and circumstances where the diagnosis is problematic such as when the patient has severe sensory deficits. Second, if it is found to be a form of dementia, the elucidation of the aetiology. Alzheimer's disease is the commonest form of dementia, cerebrovascular disease is probably the second commonest cause and Lewy body dementia is becoming increasingly recognised. Other conditions that can be excluded on clinical grounds without resort to complex and detailed investigations are subcortical dementias (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and progressive supranuclear palsy), alcohol induced dementia and a number of toxic/metabolic abnormalities such as endocrine disorders and carcinoma. The differential diagnosis of dementia is an excellent example of where simple logical clinical skills can be applied without the need for expensive investigation, which should be reserved for situations in which there is clinical doubt about the diagnosis. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is diagnosed on clinical grounds and in the presence of a characteristically abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG). For a comprehensive assessment of a person with suspected dementia, the following are necessary: detailed family and personal history and history of the current illness from a reliable informant; mental state examination of the patient with particular reference to the cognitive state; physical examination with particular emphasis on the central nervous system and; investigations, including haematological and biochemical blood tests, serum B12 and folate, thyroid function tests, chest X-ray and ECG. Other investigations may also be helpful such as CT scan or EEG.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

Stariji covjek može se smatrati toliko zdravim koliko za svoju svakodnevnicu ima dovoljno snage da se suprotstavi pojavama koje donosi starost, nedacama i svakodnevnim situacijama. Tjelesna istrosenost je relativna i ne ide usporedno sa smanjivanjem dusevnih snaga, a dusevne snage se trebaju pobuditi onda kad je potrebno svladati pojave koje donosi starenje, posebno negativan utjecaj bolesti i vanjskih faktora.\nZdravstveno stanje nije samo posljedica starosne dobi, ali svakako se starenjem povecava mogucnost da se ono narusi i sve brže mijenja. Najcesca stanja koja pogađaju stariju dobnu skupinu su povezana sa srcem i krvožilnim sustavom: hipertenzija i ateroskleroza, u gorim slucajevima infarkt; zatim, veliki je problem dijabetes, promjene u lokomotornom sustavu i sklonost padovima i frakturama. Nerijetko se događa da se uslijed nekih promjena na mozgu pojavi demencija ili druga stanja neuroloske ili psihijatrijske prirode.\nZbog svih navedenih razloga, te pomanjkanja mobilnosti i refleksa, smatra se da stariji vozaci predstavljaju određeni rizik u prometu. Nužan uvjet za ocuvanje sigurnosti na prometnicama su zdravstveni pregledi koji ce prevenirati da zdravstveno i psiholoski nesposoban vozac i dalje upravlja motornim vozilom i dovodi ostale sudionike u prometu u opasnost.\nKako bi utvrdili utjece li promjena zdravstvenog stanja uslijed starenja na vozacke sposobnosti, nasumicno je odabrano 25 ispitanika, vozaca starijih od 65 godina, to jest obrađeni su podaci iz medicinske dokumentacije nakon obavljenog zdravstvenog pregleda kod specijalista medicine rada u Domu zdravlja PGŽ. Rezultati pokazuju da su najcesca stanja i bolesti iz anamneze ispitanika hipertenzija (20%), bolesti krvožilja (14%,) i dijabetes (8%), a cak vise od polovice ispitanika je pretrpjelo frakture ili bilo hospitalizirano. 88% ispitanika je proglaseno ograniceno sposobnima, jedan ispitanik je proglasen sposobnim, a dvoje su proglaseni nesposobnima. Najcesce su Uvjerenja izdana na rok važenja od 2 ili 5 godina Nisu svi istraživaci složni oko odgovora na pitanje jesu li stariji vozaci rizicni, ali statistike za Hrvatsku prema podacima MUP-a govore da stariji vozaci uzrokuju 2/3 nesreca u kojima sudjeluju. Ako uzmemo u obzir da svi stariji vozaci koji su registrirani da posjeduju vozacku dozvolu ne voze, te da voze na znatno kracim relacijama, ovaj postotak je poražavajuci.\nIpak, nakon vise promjena zakona koji regulira kriterije za zdravstveni pregled vozaca , sada je na snazi zakon prema kojem je zdravstveni pregled obavezan samo ako je to navedeno u Uvjerenju dobivenom prije osposobljavanja vozaca. U europskim zemljama zdravstveni pregled je obavezan za starije vozace (Spanjolska, Velika Britanija, Svedska, Norveska), a jedino u Njemackoj je odgovornost o zdravstvenoj sposobnosti povjerena odabranom lijecniku vozaca.

In order to distinguish these possibilities, clinicians need to be aware of typical age-related changes in neurological signs.

In the sensorimotor examination, typical motor changes include distal muscle wasting and weakness, with diminution or loss of distal reflexes and loss of distal vibratory sensibility and sometimes other modalities such as pain and proprioception. However, not all older individuals show such changes, perhaps reflecting 'successful' or 'optimal', as opposed to 'normal', ageing.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

      "abstract": "Neurocognitive disorders, commonly known as dementias, are characterized by cognitive decline due to a range of underlying conditions, such as Alzheimer's, Lewy body, or vascular disease, or frontotemporal lobar degeneration. As assistance with everyday tasks becomes necessary, modifiable psychosocial and medical factors intersect with neurodegenerative processes to create preventable or manageable challenges that are unique to the individual with the disorder and his or her family. Health psychology plays an important role in identifying and overcoming these challenges, thereby preventing excess disability, increasing quality of life, and promoting health for patients and care partners.",

There are two broadly different mechanisms. The most obvious has a psychological or cognitive mechanism. Thus, the illness may provide the life event or chronic difficulty that triggers a depressive episode in a vulnerable Individual. Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest. The best examples are probably stroke and cardiovascular disease. Finally major depression, but especially minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms merge with other manifestations of human distress with which patients present to their doctors, Such somatic presentations test the conventional distinction between physical and mental disorder, and are a perennial source of controversy.",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

Die Nachzahlung der Rente belief sich dabei auf eine Summe von mehreren Zehntausend Euro. Der dargestellte Fall unterstreicht eindrucksvoll, dass die so genannten versteckten Symptome der MS, wie etwa Fatigue oder kognitive Defizite häufig nicht erkannt werden.

You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event.

For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, this notion has been a conspicuous part of the lore of this illness dating back to its earliest clinical descriptions.",

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

      "title": "Dementia: mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. In most individuals, the symptoms of the disease begin with mild memory difficulties after the sixth decade of life. Symptoms progress slowly, leading to significant impairment in memory, language, executive function, and other domains of cognition. Eventually, impaired cognitive abilities interfere with complex activities of daily life and ultimately result in the loss of independent function. The diagnosis is typically made in this context on the basis of clinical evidence of dementia with progressive impairment in multiple domains of cognition. Structural neuroimaging is often used in the clinical setting to evaluate for the presence of other pathologies (e.g. cerebrovascular or neoplastic disease). Functional neuroimaging, such as PET or SPECT, may be employed clinically to assist in the discrimination of different types of dementia (e.g. frontotemporal vs. Alzheimer’s dementia). Current treatments are primarily symptomatic, in that clinical trials demonstrate short-term stabilization of cognitive function but not a slowing of the rate of decline. Increasing emphasis is being placed on the development of disease-modifying therapies — drugs that impede the underlying pathophysiologic process of neurodegeneration in AD and, thereby, slow the rate of cognitive decline.",

      "abstract": "Bei der Begutachtung der Fahreignung oder der Schuldfaehigkeit kommt es darauf an, den individuellen Besonderheiten eines Menschen Rechnung zu tragen, was eine differenzierte Diagnostik voraussetzt. Als alterstypische psychische Stoerungen koennen am ehesten diejenigen Erkrankungen angesehen werden, die auf einer organischen Stoerung der Hirnfunktion beruhen. Bei den akuten Stoerungen stehen das Delir und das akute amnestische Syndrom im Vordergrund, die wichtigste Krankheitsgruppe bei Aelteren stellen jedoch die dementiellen Entwicklungen mit einer vielgestaltigen Symptomatik dar. Charakteristisch fuer eine dementielle Entwicklung sind unter anderem Beeintraechtigungen des Gedaechtnisses und des Denkvermoegens sowie Veraenderungen der Persoenlichkeit. Zur Diagnostik ist neben der psychiatrischen Exploration und der koerperlichen Untersuchung eine testpsychologische Quantifizierung des kognitiven Leistungsvermoegens erforderlich. Haeufigste Ursache dementieller Erkrankungen sind degenerative Prozesse, insbesondere die Alzheimer-Demenz. Der psychiatrische Sachverstaendige hat zur Beurteilung der strafrechtlichen Verantwortlichkeit zunaechst zu untersuchen, welche konkreten Auswirkungen die Diagnose auf die Funktionsfaehigkeit des Betroffenen hat. Erst dann erfolgt die Uebersetzung psychiatrischer Befunde und Diagnosen in ein System juristischer Begrifflichkeiten auf der Grundlageder Paragraphen 20/21 des Strafgesetzbuches (StGB). Ergeben sich bei der Begutachtung Hinweise auf eine Desorientiertheit, auf Halluzinationen oderauf wahnhafte Veraenderung des Erlebens, ist eine aufgehobene Steuerungsfaehigkeit im Sinne des Paragraph 20 StGB anzunehmen. Bei der Beurteilung der Voraussetzungen des Paragraph 21 StGB ist zu beachten, dass diese keineeigene Kategorie darstellen, da die verminderte Schuldfaehigkeit als Sonderfall der Schuldfaehigkeit angesehen wird.

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "title": "Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: What We Know Now",
      "abstract": "Small delays in onset of Alzheimer's Disease are predicted to reduce its global burden, but we need to better understand factors that increase the risk-and methods to reduce it. The clinical syndrome of dementia refers to a pattern of cognitive deficits characterized by impairment in memory and at least one other cognitive domain (e.g., language, executive functions, visuospatial abilities) that is sufficiently severe to impact behavior and interfere with social or occupational functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Dementia may be progressive, static, or remitting, and its onset and course of symptoms are a function of underlying neuropathology from various causes. For example, dementia because of a neurodegenerative process tends to involve an insidious onset with gradual progressive cognitive impairment. In contrast, dementia from vascular or acquired brain injury tends to involve an abrupt onset of clinical symptoms that may remain static or show stepwise cognitive decline that corresponds to episodes of cerebrovascular accidents. The most common causes of dementia are neuropathologically distinguished on the basis of the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease); multiple or strategically placed infarctions, ischemic injury, or hemorrhagic lesions (e.g., vascular dementia); cell loss and the deposition of Lewy bodies in sub-cortical, limbic, and neocortical regions (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies); and prominent frontal and temporal lobar atrophy (frontotemporal dementia). Dementia can also be found in the context of other neurological, infectious, or metabolic conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, human immunodeficiency virus, or traumatic brain injury. Despite recent advances in amyloid imaging and cerebral spinal fluid analysis, neuropathological changes are often only accurately assessed at autopsy. This makes definitive diagnosis during an individual's lifetime difficult. Effectively differentiating between forms of dementia or normal aging requires reliance on the neuropsychological definition of a specific pattern of cognitive deficits. Epidemiology and Neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's Disease is the leading cause of dementia in elders and accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of all dementia cases. An estimated 5.3 million Americans have Alzheimer's Disease. Reports indicate the disease is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and deaths because of Alzheimer's Disease are on the rise, with an increase of 46 percent between 2000 and 2006. Given the advancing age of the baby boom generation, by 2050, 14 million older Americans and 81 million adults worldwide are expected to have the disease (Alzheimer's Association, 2010a). Alzheimer's Disease is an age-related degenerative brain disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular fibrillar amyloid deposits and intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These characteristics lead to neuronal atrophy and synapse loss in medial temporal lobe limbic structures that are critical for episodic memory and extend to the association cortices of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes with disease progression (Braak and Braak, 1991). Consistent with these widespread neuropathological changes, the primary clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive global dementia syndrome that usually begins in later life. It is generally agreed that the pathological cascade of brain changes occurs gradually in Alzheimer's Disease, beginning with the very early accrual of Aβ plaques in the brain, and is followed by a variable lag time after which neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the leading pathological process (Jack et al., 2010). Although Aβ neuropathology is thought to be causal, clinical symptoms are more closely related to neurofibrillary tangles than amyloid deposition. …",

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy though a common neurological illness has complex aetiology and several different presentations. The term peripheral neuropathy includes symmetric polyneuropathy, single and multiple mononeuropathy, and radiculopathy. Further classication depends on a mixture of phenomenological, pathological, and genetic or other aetiological features. It is heterogeneous in aetiology, diverse in pathology, and varied in severity. Managing a case of perpipheral neuropathy brings along numerous challenges include identifying a case of peripheral neurophy and differentiating it from mimicks, working up for etiology and treatment based on aetiology. Patients can present with either positive or negative symptoms (or both) linked to motor and sensory systems or with autonomic disturbances in some neuropathies. A detailed history and physical examination provides information regarding onset, course and progression of the disease and the type of involvement like generalized, distal or proximal, symmetric or asymmetric, also the type of bre involvement like large myelinated or small unmyelinated and may give clues to neuro anatomic localization of the disease. The diagnosis can be conrmed through a appropriate investigation for the neuropathic pattern like blood tests, Cerebrospinal uid (CSF) analysis, MRI Brain, Ultrasound (USg). These test along with Electro diagnostic investigations like Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS), needle electromyography (EMG) can narrow down differentials and possible aetiologies, However in signicant cases etiology remain undiagnosed. Genetic testing is most diagnostic in carefully selected cases. Sometimes nerve biopsy and skin biopsy may be needed to conrm the etiologies.",

      "abstract": "Clinical entities listed as mood disorders in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) relevant to depression in elderly patients include 1) bipolar disorder, 2) major depressive disorder (with or without psychotic features), and 3) persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

Since memory functions are widely distributed in the brain, memory disturbance forms part of the clinical picture in many pathological states. These include acute conditions associated with alterations in consciousness and chronic conditions secondary to vascular, infective, neoplastic, traumatic, metabolic, and other causes. Such memory disturbances are usually non-specific, involving several stages of memory, and are overshadowed by other clinical features. Much less commonly, relatively selective memory loss occurs and memory disturbance forms the major clinical symptom.

      "abstract": "A demência pode ser caracterizada por uma deterioração adquirida na capacidade cognitiva, prejudicando o desempenho adequado de atividades cotidianas. Dentre as capacidades afetadas, a memória é a principal vítima desta condição. Outras capacidades também podem ser acometidas, tais como a linguagem, habilidade visuespacial, o cálculo, o discernimento e a resolução de problemas. Uma das causas da síndrome demêncial é a hidrocefalia normobárica (HNB), a qual afeta principalmente pessoas idosas, sendo possivelmente resultado de algum trauma ou doença, ainda que as causas exatas não estejam totalmentes claras. Esta pode ser apresentada com a clássica tríade: distúrbio de marcha (atáxica ou apráxica), demência e incontinência urinária e, é definida pelo acúmulo do líquido cefalorraquidiano (LCR ou líquor) nas cavidades ventriculares cranianas. O LCR banha o cérebro e a medula espinhal tendo como uma de suas finalidades a de evitar que possíveis traumas atinjam e comprometam o funcionamento adequado do sistema nervoso central (SNC). O diagnóstico dessa doença pode ser difícil e, muitas vezes ser confundido com outras patologias como o mal de Parkinson e o Alzheimer, além disso, o quadro clínico destas doenças podem estar sobrepostos e, muitas vezes, pacientes tratados para HNB podem estar sofrendo também de outra condição. O presente trabalho visa discutir o caso clínico de uma paciente de 73 anos diagnosticada e tratada cirurgicamente para hidrocefalia, abordando os sinais e sintomas, diagnósticos diferenciais e as melhorias na qualidade de vida após realização do adequado tratamento cirúrgico.",

Therefore, except for dementia and epilepsy, there are no objective biomarkers for diagnosis. A set of examinations is performed to rule out physical diseases, but there is no diagnostic evaluation tool for depression that corresponds to, for example, blood pressure, blood glucose, x-rays, or echocardiography. The reasons for the poor understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders include the difficulty in sampling the human brain and CNS, and there are no pure animal models for depression or bipolar disorder because the human and animal brains are very different. Another barrier regarding drug treatment is that high-molecular-weight drugs cannot reach the central nervous system due to the blood-brain barrier.",

      "title": "Retrograde Amnesia – A Question of Disturbed Calcium Levels?",
      "abstract": "Retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events or information. The successful acquisition and memory of information is required before retrograde amnesia may occur. Often, the trigger for retrograde amnesia is a traumatic event. Loss of memories may be caused in two ways: either by loss/erasure of the memory itself or by the inability to access the memory, which is still present. In general, memories and learning are associated with a positive connotation although the extinction of unpleasant experiences and memories of traumatic events may be highly welcome. In contrast to the many experimental models addressing learning deficits caused by anterograde amnesia, the incapability to acquire new information, retrograde amnesia could so far only be investigated sporadically in human patients and in a limited number of model systems. Apart from models and diseases in which neurodegeneration or dementia like Alzheimer’s disease result in loss of memory, retrograde amnesia can be elicited by various drugs of which alcohol is the most prominent one and exemplifies the non-specific effects and the variable duration. External or internal impacts like traumatic brain injury, stroke, or electroconvulsive treatments may similarly result in variable degrees of retrograde amnesia. In this review, I will discuss a new genetic approach to induce retrograde amnesia in a mouse model and raise the hypothesis that retrograde amnesia is caused by altered intracellular calcium homeostasis. Recently, we observed that neuronal loss of neuroplastin resulted in retrograde amnesia specifically for associative memories. Neuroplastin is tightly linked to the expression of the main Ca 2+ extruding pumps, the plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs). Therefore, neuronal loss of neuroplastin may block the retrieval and storage of associative memories by interference with Ca 2+ signaling cascades. The possibility to elicit retrograde amnesia in a controlled manner allows to investigate the underlying mechanisms and may provide a deeper understanding of the molecular and circuit processes of memory.",

      "title": "Developmental delay and epilepsy",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Developmental delay can be associated with epilepsy. Epilepsy might be either the cause of the delay of acquisitions (epileptogenic encephalopathy) or only one additional manifestation, the consequence of the underlying neurological pathology (encephalopathy with epilepsy); it is therefore not the only factor responsible for delay. Within the framework of encephalopathies with epilepsy a rigorous diagnosis is necessary with, in particular a cutaneous examination (neuro‐cutaneous syndromes), a precise clinical examination (anoxo‐ischaemic sequelae of the perinatal period), an EEG, a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as the search for associated abnomalities (cardiac, renal…). There are also epileptogenic encephalopathies such as age‐related syndromes: Hemiconvulsions‐Hemiplegia‐Epilepsy syndrome; Rasmussen's syndrome; Dravet's syndrome; myoclono‐astatic epilepsy (Doose). Age at onset and type of seizures, as well as ictal and interictal EEG finding provide valuable hints for a specific diagnosis, while other investigation are usually not contributive. Developmental delay and epilepsy are frequently associated. One of the first steps to diagnosis consists in trying to establish the eventual causal role of the epilepsy. Answering this question may prove to be of primary importance for the choice of a therapeutic strategy and/or further etiological investigations.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia requires both a report of poor sleep at night and residual daytime impairment associated with the poor sleep. Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The metabolic and anatomical substrate of most forms of mental retardation is not known. Because the basis of normal brain function is not sufficiently understood, the basis of abnormal function is understood poorly. Even in disorders where the fundamental biochemical defect is known, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and other enzyme defects, the exact basis for brain dysfunction is uncertain. The outcome for treated PKU, galactosemia, homocystinuria, and lysosomal disorders is not yet optimal. The various forms of nonketotic hyperglycinemia often respond poorly to current therapy. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures, such as deficient synthesis of serine or creatine and impaired glucose transport into the brain, and disorders with variable malformations, such as Smith‐Lemli‐Opitz (SLO) syndrome and the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures and disorders with variable malformations may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Simple tests of urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid may lead to a diagnosis, accurate genetic counseling, and better treatment. Metabolic brain imaging (magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)) has also helped to reveal biochemical abnormalities within the brain. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

В настоящее время диагноз дисциркуляторной энцефалопатии (ДЭП) или хронической ишемии головного мозга (ХИГМ) остается одним из самых распространенных в отечественной практике. В современной зарубежной литературе и неврологической практике не используется диагноз ДЭП или ХИГМ, но выделяются сосудистые когнитивные расстройства, которые расцениваются как основное проявление хронической цереброваскулярной патологии. Приводятся собственные данные автора, демонстрирующие, как под маской ДЭП/ХИГМ протекают другие неврологические (болезнь Альцгеймера, первичные головные боли, пери ерическая вестибулопатия) или психические заболевания. Ошибочный диагноз имеют более половины пациентов, наблюдающихся с диагнозом ДЭП/ХИГМ. Демонстрируются случаи, когда выявление первичной головной боли, истинной причины вестибулярного головокружения и адекватное их лечение позволяют помочь пациентам, которые длительно и безуспешно лечатся от ДЭП или ХИГМ. Обсуждаются вопросы профилактики развития и прогрессирования сосудистых когнитивных расстройств, важная роль коррекции факторов риска инсульта, лечения артериальной гипертензии и других заболеваний. Эффективное лечение сосудистых когнитивных расстройств имеет большее значение, по- скольку способно замедлить прогрессирование заболевания, привести к снижению часто- ты развития инсульта и деменции.

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

Sometimes, neurological disorders may also be associated with neuropathic pain, which can be challenging to manage. For example, multiple sclerosis (MS) may cause chronic centralized painful symptoms due to nerve damage. Other chronic neuropathic pain syndromes may occur in the form of post-stroke pain, spinal cord injury pain, and other central pain syndromes. Chronic neuropathic pain is associated with dysfunction, disability, depression, disturbed sleep, and reduced quality of life. Early diagnosis may help improve outcomes, and pain control can be an important factor in restoring function. There are more than 100 different types of peripheral neuropathy and those involving sensory neurons can provoke painful symptoms. Accurate diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy is essential for pain control. Further examples are represented by gluten neuropathy, which is an extraintestinal manifestation of gluten sensitivity and presents as a form of peripheral neuropathy; in these unusual cases, neuropathy may be managed with diet. Neuropathic pain has been linked to CoronaVirus Disease (COVID) infection both during acute infection and as a post-viral syndrome known as long COVID. In this last case, neuropathic pain relates to the host's response to the virus. However, neuropathic pain may occur after any critical illness and has been observed as part of a syndrome following intensive care unit hospitalization.",

Moreover, even in presence of a probable psychogenic disorder, patients tend to reject the \"functional\" diagnosis, for cultural reasons linked to the old philosophical separation between diseases of the body and mind (the latter with a \"lower\" status). The current evolution of neuroscience should lead us to the conclusion that all so-called \"functional\" disorders are manifestations of cerebral suffering; at the same time an existential approach to the disease must make us wary of reductionist conclusions, because the clinical expression of a lesion is in the great majority of cases modulated by the culture and the history of the patient.",

      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms are very common in chronic conditions.This is true so for neurodegenerative diseases.A number of patients with cognitive decline and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and related conditions like Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal degeneration amongst other entities, experience depressive symptoms in greater or lesser grade at some point during the course of the illness.Depressive symptoms have a particular significance in neurological disorders, specially in neurodegenerative diseases, because brain, mind, behavior and mood relationship.A number of patients may develop depressive symptoms in early stages of the neurologic disease, occurring without clear presence of cognitive decline with only mild cognitive deterioration.Classically, depression constitutes a reliable diagnostic challenge in this setting.However, actually we can recognize and evaluate depressive, cognitive or motor symptoms of neurodegenerative disease in order to establish their clinical significance and to plan some therapeutic strategies.Depressive symptoms can appear also lately, when the neurodegenerative disease is fully developed.The presence of depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms have a negative impact on the quality-of-life of patients and caregivers.Besides, patients with depressive symptoms also tend to further decrease function and reduce cognitive abilities and also uses to present more affected clinical status, compared with patients without depression.Depressive symptoms are treatable.Early detection of depressive symptoms is very important in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, in order to initiate the most adequate treatment.We review in this paper the main neurodegenerative diseases, focusing in depressive symptoms of each other entities and current recommendations of management and treatment.",

      "title": "Lethargie bei Hungernden; Überlebensstrategie oder klinische Depression? Kognitive und psychovegetative Depressionssymptome im Hungerstoffwechsel unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Hunger und andere Formen der Mangelernahrung konnen verschiedene Konsequenzen fur den Organismus nach sich ziehen, wie zum Beispiel eine Herzinsuffizienz, eine Fettleber, Formen der Protein-Energie-Malnutrition wie Kwashiorkor und Marasmus und schlimmstenfalls den Tod. Bisher weniger grundlich untersucht sind die Folgen extremer Unterernahrung fur die Psyche. Menschen, die unter Hunger leiden, wirken antriebs- und kraftlos und lethargisch. Man konnte vermuten, dass sie depressiv sind. Aber erfullen sie wirklich die Diagnosekriterien einer klinischen Depression? Die Beantwortung dieser Frage konnte wichtige Hinweise darauf bergen, welche langfristigen Konsequenzen etwa auf eine Hungersnot oder ein weiteres Ansteigen der Pravalenz der Anorexia Nervosa folgen konnten. Dies konnte sowohl relevant fur die Arbeit von Arzten, Oecotrophologen, Psychologen und anderen therapeutischen Berufsgruppen sein als auch, auf einer globalen Ebene, bedeutsame Informationen fur die okonomischen Folgen beinhalten, die auf eine von Mangelernahrung betroffene Gesellschaft zukommen. So konnte eine durch Hunger induzierte erhohte Depressionspravalenz weitere Kosten fur das wahrscheinlich ohnehin gebeutelte Gesundheitssystem eines betroffenen Staats nach sich ziehen. Zudem ist es fur Menschen, die zusatzlich zu den korperlichen Entbehrungen des Hungers unter Symptomen der Antriebslosigkeit, Hoffnungslosigkeit, Interesse- und Freudlosigkeit leiden, um einiges schwerer, Kraft und Motivation fur den Wiederaufbau eines Landes zu finden. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschaftigt sich daher damit, ob Mangelernahrung zum Entstehen einer Depression fuhrt und welcher Art die gefundenen Symptome sind. Mangelernahrung ist ein weltweit verbreitetes Phanomen, das verschiedene Ursachen haben kann. Wahrend Hunger ein groses Problem in armeren Landern darstellt, entwickeln vor allem in den industrialisierten Landern immer mehr Menschen Essstorungen. Die in dieser Arbeit formulierten Hypothesen wurden anhand einer Zusammenfassung der Literatur und der wichtigsten Studien uberpruft. Es wurde gefunden, dass Mangelernahrung nicht zu einer klinisch diagnostizierbaren Depression, aber dennoch zu ausgepragten depressiven Symptomen fuhrt, die sich nach einer Normalisierung der Nahrungsaufnahme zuruckbilden. Diese Auswirkungen beschranken sich nicht auf einen somatischen Symptombereich, sondern finden sich ebenso in psychischen und kognitiven Gebieten. Weitere insbesondere experimentelle Forschungsarbeiten zur Kontrolle dieser Ergebnisse waren wertvoll fur die Weiterentwicklung des Verstandnisses der Interaktion von Mangelernahrung und Symptomen psychischer Erkrankungen.",

      "abstract": "The author, largely from a clinical standpoint, discusses the various ideas of negation. He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

Ich patologia wiąże się z utratą komórek nerwowych, zaś istota procesu chorobowego wiedzie do wystąpienia wielu objawów uszkodzeń neurologicznych, związanych z funkcją motoryczną (np. ataksja) oraz z pamięcią (demencja). Proces wiodący do pojawienia się objawów choroby neurodegeneracyjnej rozpoczyna się znacznie wcześniej, zanim się one pojawią. Przebiega często przez wiele lat i bywa bezobjawowy. Pierwsze symptomy pojawiają się gdy znacząca liczba neuronów ulegnie uszkodzeniu, bądź uszkodzenie dotyczy określonej części ośrodkowego układu nerwowego. Jedną z chorób neurodegradacyjnych jest choroba Alzheimera . Dotyczy głównie osób po 65. roku życia i dotyka 5-7% populacji. Czas jej trwania wynosi ok. 8-14 lat. Specyfiką choroby jest stopniowe i nieodwracalne zaburzenie homeostazy organizmu, zaburzenia procesów poznawczych i postępujący zanik pamięci, który prowadzi do zaburzeń orientacji wzrokowo-przestrzennej. Pojawiająca się apraksja skutkuje niemożnością posługiwania się przyborami codziennego użytku. W późnej fazie otępienie jest bardzo nasilone zaś pamięć często ograniczona jedynie do faktów autobiograficznych. Zaburzenia mowy są na tyle zaawansowane, że chory może wypowiadać pojedyncze słowa. Występują również zaburzenia emocjonalne, przejawiające się apatią lub agresywnością. Zaburzenia obejmują również problemy z przeżuwaniem, przełykaniem i kontrolą zwieraczy.

Im neurologischen Krankheitsspektrum stehen insbesondere die Parkinsonsyndrome, die Multisystematrophie und die Small fibre Neuropathien im Focus der Aufmerksamkeit hinsichtlich der Veränderungen der Kreislaufregulation mit orthostatischer Hypotonie oder dem zusätzlichen Vorkommen einer Liegendhypertonie. Sorgfältige Anamnese und apparative Diagnostik sind neben der klinischen Untersuchung unabdingbar. Die weiterführende Diagnostik umfasst neben bedside tests wie den Schellong-Test verschiedene standardisierte Untersuchungsmethoden im autonomen Funktionslabor wie die Kipptischuntersuchung oder die Analyse der Herzfrequenzvariabilität. Die hohe Variabilität des autonomen Nervensystems aber auch der angewandten diagnostischen Methoden und Messplätze macht eine Standardisierung dieser Techniken notwendig. Hierfür stellen Leitlinien, Konsensusempfehlungen, SOPs usw. eine besondere Hilfe dar.

      "abstract": "The clinical presentation and course of patients with mitochondrial syndromes are extremely diverse. These diseases may manifest at any age from birth until late adulthood with acute manifestation or as a chronic progressive disease. Virtually any organ may be impaired, but the organs with the highest energetic demands are most frequently involved, including brain, muscle, heart and liver. Some mitochondrial disorders affect a single organ (e.g., the eye in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy), but many involve multiple organ systems. Many patients display an assemblage of clinical features that can be ascribed to a discrete clinical syndrome, such as the Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), neurogenic weakness with ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), or mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). On the other hand, many other mitochondrial disorders do not clearly fit into one particular and recognizable syndrome category, and the spectrum of disease phenotypes can be broadly overlapping among several syndromes. All possible inheritance patterns can be found (maternal, X linked, autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and de novo occurrence) due to the dual involvement of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.",

Zu den wichtigsten Symptomen einer Demenz gehören die Gedächtnisstörung, die Einbuße im Denk- und Urteilsvermögen, in der Konzentrationsfähigkeit und der Informationsverarbeitung. Störungen des Sozialverhaltens, des Antriebs oder der Stimmung treten in der Regel hinzu. Die Symptomatik ist so ausgeprägt, dass die übliche Alltagsbewältigung beeinträchtigt wird. Weniger schwere Symptomkonstellationen werden als leichte kognitive Störung vom Demenzsyndrom abgegrenzt. Sie äußern sich meist in Einbußen der Merkfähigkeit (Abrufstörung), intervenieren hingegen nicht mit der Bewältigung der gewohnten Alltagsaufgaben. Die mit Abstand häufigste Form einer Demenz ist die Alzheimer-Krankheit, gefolgt von der vaskulären Demenz. Weitere, irreversibel verlaufende Demenzursachen sind etwa die Parkinson-Demenz, die Demenz mit Lewy-Körperchen und die frontotemporalen Degenerationen. Potenziell behebbare Ursachen für eine Demenz sind besonders zu beachten, z.B. Depression, kommunizierender Hydrozephalus oder Hypothyreose. Für die Therapie ist zudem die Erhebung der noch vorhandenen Fertigkeiten des Patienten wichtig. Eine verständliche Aufklärung des Patienten über seine Erkrankung sollte die Regel für den Arzt sein, Ausnahmen hiervon muss er begründen.",

      "title": "New symptoms in a patient with diagnosed porphyria – untypical clinical course or another disease? Extended differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Acute liver porphyrias are caused by mutations of genes encoding the heme biosynthesis enzymes. A lack of any of these enzymes leads to a decrease in the heme level, which in each case is manifested by identical clinical symptoms. Nervous tissue is particularly susceptible to a depletion of heme levels. Three classical symptoms of a porphyria attack include: abdominal pain (as a manifestation of autonomic neuropathy), peripheral neuropathy, and psychic disturbances. Apart from the main symptoms, porphyria attacks may be manifested as various neurological disturbances, such as: bulbar palsy, epileptic seizures, psychic disturbances and focal symptoms of CNS damage. The intensity of individual symptoms can vary. Although neurological symptoms usually disappear after the attack, they may cause permanent deficits. Through involving CNS, porphyria can mimic other neurological disorders. Damage to the nervous system can be confirmed by additional examinations. Thus far, disseminated focal changes during the attack, which disappear after the regression of clinical symptoms, have been described in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Spinal cord abnormalities in MRI scans have not been described yet, despite the fact that damage to the anterior horn associated with porphyria has been confirmed in literature. While examining cerebrospinal fluid during the attack, an elevated protein level has been noticed, so far without the presence of oligoclonal bands. This paper aimed to demonstrate that porphyria should be considered in differential diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). This paper is based on the case of a symptomatic patient who carried a mutation in one of the genes for porphyria, and who developed a clinical manifestation of focal damage to CNS. A differential diagnosis of porphyria and CIS, with a subsequent conversion to a clinically defined MS, was carried out. The results of additional examinations performed routinely in both disorders, the clinical picture and data from medical literature have been used in the analysis of this case. The authors present the case of a patient with confirmed genetic porphyria, who was hospitalized for purposes of establishing a diagnosis due to weakened lower extremities. The patient manifested spastic lower extremity paresis, sensation disorders and urinary incontinence, which indicated spinal cord damages. An MRI scan of the thoracic spine revealed disseminated foci with contrast enhancement. A high level of proteins and oligoclonal bands were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. On the basis of a new clinical picture (differing from the previous attack symptoms), prolonged symptoms, spinal cord lesions in MRI, and the presence of oligoclonal bands, CIS was diagnosed. Quick and complete recovery was obtained due to the administering of a steroid therapy. After several months, the patient reported a similar, passing episode, which, according to the authors, confirmed the diagnosis and an expected conversion to a clinically defined MS. Taking into consideration the clinical manifestation of spinal cord involvement untypical of porphyria, the detection of spinal lesions in an MRI scan, the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid and the positive effect of steroid therapy, the authors believe that this described patient, who was a symptomatic carrier of a mutation in a gene for porphyria, developed CIS. This reported case, supported by data from medical literature, shows that porphyria should be taken into consideration in any differential diagnosis of CIS and MS.",

The typical clinical features of PD reflect well-known pathology in the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, while extra-nigral pathology accounts for many of the non-motor features of PD. As will be subsequently discussed, the most characteristic pathologic feature of PD is neurodegeneration with Lewy body (LB) formation, but it must be acknowledged that occasionally other pathologic processes cause clinical features typical of PD. In particular, some cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA) or even progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) may be clinically mistaken for PD (Bower et al., 2002). More problematic are cases of PD with juvenile onset or those associated with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, such as cases with Parkin and DJ-1 mutations (see below), in which LBs may not be present. Other early onset familial cases present with atypical clinical features such as early dementia and psychosis, which are not characteristic of typical PD (Gwinn-Hardy et al. 2000). Another diagnostic challenge is the relationship of cognitive dysfunction in PD to concurrent Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (McKeith et al. 1996).",

Neurological deficits associated with liver disease may affect the CNS, the peripheral nervous system, or both. This review focuses on syndromes characterised by altered CNS function associated with structural liver diseases. Space does not permit consideration of peripheral neuropathies associated with liver disease (for example, xanthomatous peripheral neuropathy), diseases of childhood that affect the liver and CNS (for example, Reye’s syndrome), or neurological consequences of hepatic lesions characterised by specific enzyme deficiencies (for example, congenital hyperammonaemias, the porphyrias, kernicterus, galactosaemia, and Zellweger’s syndrome (cerebrohepatorenal syndrome)).\n\nThat there is a relationship between the functional status of the liver and that of the brain has been known for centuries.1 The most widely recognised aspect of this relation is that hepatocellular failure may be complicated by the behavioural syndrome of hepatic encephalopathy, in which neurotransmission in the brain is altered.2 3 Recently, it has been suggested that two other behavioural complications of liver disease, scratching due to pruritus in cholestatic patients4 5 and profound fatigue in patients with chronic cholestasis,6 7 may also be associated with altered neurotransmission in the brain.\n\n### DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATION\n\nThe term hepatic encephalopathy refers to the syndrome of neuropsychiatric disturbances that may arise as a complication of acute, subacute, or chronic hepatocellular failure. The syndrome is associated with increased portal-systemic shunting of gut derived constituents of portal venous blood, due to their impaired extraction by the failing liver and, in most instances, their passage through intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic portal-systemic venous collateral channels.\n\nThe term portal-systemic encephalopathy …",

A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

Epilepsy rarely dominates the clinical presentation, which is more frequently associated with other neurologic symptoms, such as mental retardation, hypotonia and/or dystonia, or vigilance disturbances. The pathogenesis of seizures is multifaceted; inherited metabolic disorder can affect the balance between excitatory and inhibitory chemical mediators, eliminate an energetic substrate at the cerebral level, cause in utero brain malformation, or provoke acute brain lesions. Some clinical disorders that strongly suggest particular metabolic etiologies can be identified. For example, specific clinical signs and findings on electroencephalogram (EEG) are characteristic of pyridoxine-dependent seizures, and inherited metabolic disorders associated with early myoclonic encephalopathy are well defined. In most cases, however, epilepsy secondary to inherited metabolic disorders presents with polymorphic clinical and EEG features that are difficult to classify into precise epileptic syndromes. Common characteristics of these seizures include onset in the first months of life; usually partial, multifocal; simple partial motor semiology; successive appearance of tonic seizures, spasms, and massive myoclonus; and resistance to antiepilepsy drugs. Inherited metabolic disorders must be considered in patients presenting with epilepsy and progressive neurologic worsening.",

There are central as well as peripheral mechanisms of fatigue formation. Frequent is a combination of fatigue and affective disorders in MS, in particular depression, as well as sleep disturbances (insomnia, restless legs syndrome) that may indicate the common origin of their mechanisms, i.e. reduction of serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems activity. Endocrinal and autoimmune components are considered as important in fatigue syndrome formation, the latter exerting more influence on asthenia than on pathological fatigability.

De plus, il n’existe pas de certitude quant aux effets de la consommation chronique d’alcool dans l’apparition ou l’aggravation des modifications cognitives observees dans le vieillissement normal, les demences neurodegeneratives (maladie d’Alzheimer, demence frontotemporale) ou encore le traumatisme crânien. Il semble aujourd’hui necessaire de sensibiliser les cliniciens au depistage des troubles de l’alcoolisation dans le cadre des consultations memoire ou lors de la prise en charge des patients cerebroleses.",

      "abstract": "Every physician faces the problem of dealing with mental symptoms in his patients. Mental symptoms are of very frequent occurrence. They may arise in the course of any disease process. Not infrequently cases appear in which a morbid mental state constitutes the essential etiologic soil out of which the somatic, or bodily, symptoms arise. On the other hand, organic disease is constantly giving rise to emotional or mental reactions. On whichever basis they may arise, much of the mental symptomatology commonly encountered can be interpreted by the general medical practitioner. The general physician often hesitates to deal with mental conditions, although he attacks with confidence problems of equally obscure organic, serologic or bacterial origin. For example, the clinician makes use of the technical researches of the specialist in cardiorenal disorders, or of the biochemist in diabetes, or of the endocrinologist in the use of complicated ductless gland therapy.

Dystonia is often classifi ed by etiology, which may be primary (sporadic or familial) or secondary. Secondary causes of dystonia have accompanying neurological defi cits or an identifi able structural or metabolic lesion. Etiological classifi cation of dystonia has undergone extensive modifi cations as genetic underpinnings for some forms of dystonia have been newly identifi ed [chap. 3]. Secondary dystonia may be further classifi ed into symptomatic dystonia and the dystonia-plus syndromes. Symptomatic dystonia is due to an identifi able brain disease, an obvious brain or peripheral insult, or a hereditary or sporadic degeneration of the brain. The dystonia-plus syndromes (1) have accompanying neurological signs and/or clinical and laboratory fi ndings suggestive of neurochemical disorders, without evidence of an underlying neurodegenerative process (Box 17.1).",

      "title": "L’effet de menace du stéréotype en situation d’évaluation neuropsychologique : enjeux cliniques",
      "abstract": "Due to longer life expectancy, many people are concerned about the effects of aging on their mental faculties (e.g., decline in memory) and the possibility of developing Alzheimer's disease, and they are therefore more likely to undergo neuropsychological testing. If their cognitive complaint is confirmed by a performance below the level of healthy older adults, these people are diagnosed as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a syndrome that sometimes progresses to Alzheimer's disease. The number of older people diagnosed with MCI after a memory assessment continues to increase. However, not all MCI patients develop Alzheimer's disease, with some remaining stable and others even reverting back to normal. A possible explanation could be that stereotype threat permeates the clinical testing situation and lowers patients’ performance, resulting in a false-positive detection of MCI. Several laboratory studies have shown that negative stereotypes of aging (beliefs that aging inevitably causes cognitive decline) can disrupt normal cognitive functioning in healthy older adults, leading them to perform below their true abilities. This deleterious effect of stereotypes on performance is known as the “stereotype threat effect.” Only a few studies have examined, in a laboratory setting, age-based stereotype threat effects on neuropsychological testing, and none of them were conducted in a real clinical setting. The present article reviews these studies and presents the protocol of an ongoing experiment examining, for the first time, stereotype threat effects during real neuropsychological testing among patients coming for their first memory assessment. The protocol is composed of either a standard test-administration condition, which is assumed to implicitly activate negative stereotypes of aging, or a threat-reduction condition, with instructions designed to alleviate anxiety related to these stereotypes. This innovative protocol is likely to offer new recommendations to improve the assessment conditions and accuracy of the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, with positive consequences for the well-being of patients and their caregivers.",

Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is the most precisely defined neuromuscular complication in this context. It is characterized by a primary axonal degeneration of the motor and sensory nerve fibers with degeneration of the skeletal muscles as a result of their denervation. The precise etiology of CIP remains elusive. Electrophysiology must be used to confirm the diagnosis of CIP because clinical evaluation is clearly insufficient and testing can also exclude other entities such as a Guillain-Barré syndrome or a primary disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Nerve biopsy studies are not required for a diagnosis of CIP. Other disorders can explain neurophysiological abnormalities in critically ill patients after the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, such as persistent neuromuscular junction blockade, pure axonal neuropathy, and necrotizing myopathy. The incidence of myopathies in critically ill patients is not well characterized, although the incidence most likely is high in critically ill patients with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). The clinical picture of a primary myopathy is indistinguishable from other ICU-acquired causes of neuromuscular disease. Three main forms of myopathies in the ICU have been described: critical illness myopathy, thick filament myopathy, and necrotizing myopathy. Myopathies are difficult to detect because the neurophysiological studies are neither sensitive nor specific and a muscle biopsy is required.",

There is still a debate as to whether psychotic-like experiences in the community are on a continuum with psychotic symptoms in those meeting diagnostic criteria for psychosis diagnostic constructs. Schizophrenia may exist on a continuum with related conditions (e.g. schizotypal personality disorder). There are differences between people meeting criteria for schizophrenia and healthy controls but none that can be used as a diagnostic test to separate the two, with the possible exception of anomalous self-experiences differentiating schizophrenia spectrum conditions from healthy controls and other diagnostic constructs. Several general medical conditions also exist on a continuum with health with no zones of rarity (e.g. hypertension and type 2 diabetes). Thresholds to meet criteria for these diagnostic constructs are chosen by expert committees often based on risk of developing complications (e.g. myocardial infarctions) and/or whether medical intervention may be beneficial. Even reasonably objective investigations can give abnormal results in healthy people. Concerns about whether thresholds are too low, leading to over-diagnosis, unnecessary treatment, and iatrogenic harm, also exist in general medicine. Other classifications in mental health will need to use thresholds in order to fulfil functions such as administration, research, or access to services. Dimensional classifications are good at representing the many spectrums of mental health.",

Instead, some people maintain relatively normal cognitive functioning despite neuropathologic burden, a phenomenon called cognitive resilience. Using a longitudinal, epidemiological, clinical-pathologic cohort study (N=348), the present research investigated associations between well-being and cognitive resilience. Consistent with pre-registered hypotheses, higher eudaimonic well-being (i.e., Ryff Psychological Well-being Scale) and higher hedonic well-being (i.e., Satisfaction with Life Scale) were associated with better-than-expected cognitive functioning relative to one’s neuropathological burden (i.e., beta-amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies, vascular pathologies, hippocampal sclerosis, and TDP-43). The association of eudaimonic well-being in particular was present above and beyond known cognitive resilience factors (i.e., socioeconomic status, education, cognitive activity, low neuroticism, low depression) and dementia risk factors (i.e., ApoE genotype, medical comorbidities). This research highlights the importance of considering eudaimonic well-being in efforts to prevent dementia.",

There are a large number of disorders that can lead to dementia, and neuropathological examination after death is necessary to determine the underlying cause with certainty. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate neuropathological findings in patients with dementia and neuropathological staging of dementia disorders, the main potential gain being increased epidemiological knowledge and improved neuropathological dementia diagnostics. We could confirm the generally accepted opinion that on a neuropathological basis, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common dementia disorder, followed by vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed AD+VaD. Also, in a significant number of patients, the clinical dementia subtype diagnosis does not correspond with the neuropathological findings. Furthermore, degeneration of the nucleus locus coeruleus, often seen already macroscopically, generally indicates the diagnoses Lewy body disease (LBD) or AD among the demented, while a preserved locus coeruleus occurs mainly in VaD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Moreover, various neuropathological staging systems for AD differ in procedure and targeted pathology, and the choice of system affects the judgement of Alzheimer pathology and hence the final diagnosis. Also, various neuropathological LBD staging systems differ in applicability and to some extent in the judgment of Lewy-related pathology. (Less)",

Thus damage to the brain may involve morphologically visible loss of brain substance or may consist of reduction in specific populations of neurones. It may also involve specific transmitter systems or originate in disturbances of metabolism. The list of diseases which may be associated with dementia is therefore long.",

All describe an idiopathic syndrome characterized by disabling fatigue and other symptoms occurring chronically and exacerbated by minimal exertion. Aetiology and pathogenesis—it is likely that multiple factors operate to predispose, precipitate, and perpetuate CFS: (1) predisposing factors—some individuals may be predisposed to develop CFS by virtue of genetics, personality, or other vulnerability; (2) precipitating factors—the condition may be precipitated by factors such as infection or psychological stresses; (3) perpetuating factors—for practical management the most important factors are those that perpetuate the illness and consequently act as barriers to recovery, including modifiable psychological, biological, behavioural, and social factors. Studies have reported a variety of biological abnormalities: few have been confirmed, but the most robust are (1) altered brain function, and (2) reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responsiveness, although it is not clear if these are primary or secondary to inactivity....",

The child and adolescent presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms always needs a neuropsychiatric work-up comprising a psychiatric examination and a neurodevelopmental evaluation. Laboratory work-up of some kind is often required also as is a neuropsychological assessment. It is always difficult to draw the clinical line in deciding what is (and what is not) a ‘neuropsychiatric symptom’. Whenever there is a suspicion of a named disorder reflecting brain problems, a genetic disorder or when there are symptoms such as social withdrawal, empathy deficits, psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, confusion), pervasive attention deficits, learning problems, motor control problems, tics (motor or vocal), grossly disturbed eating behaviour, or significant weight loss in children or adolescents, a full neuropsychiatric work-up is always required. The neurodevelopmental work-up includes a detailed family history, review of the pregnancy and early developmental history, evaluation of social and academic settings and a developmental and neuromotor evaluation.",

When these symptoms are associated with exercise, a biochemical defect in glycolytic or lipid metabolism, a mitochondrial myopathy, or defect in muscle contraction is frequently suspected. Diagnosis is usually established when such defect is demonstrated histochemically or by NMR. In some neuromuscular disorders, these symptoms may not necessarily be induced by exercise and they are usually part of a wide constellation of symptoms. Some of them are distinct enough to be recognized clinically or electrophysiologically, as in peripheral neuropathies, myotonias, or syndromes of continuous muscle activity. However, despite modern histochemical techniques, a number of muscle disorders remain, characterized primarily by muscle pain and cramps, where light microscopy or electrophysiologic studies show either normal or nonspecific findings.",

      "abstract": "There is reason to presume the existence of an epileptological disease entity called 'common generalized epilepsy' (CGE) with generalized-synchronous seizure discharges and strictly nonfocal seizures (petit mal, grand mal, myoclonus) occurring chiefly in the age range from 4 to 16 years. There is no evidence of causative pathology. The basic functional disturbance is likely to involve arousal mechanisms ('dyshormia') and/or photosensitivity. The genetic factor is highly complex. This entity must be differentiated from electrically or epileptologically very similar conditions. Among 300 epileptics with predominantly generalized seizure discharges in the EEG, only 20% (61 patients) fell into the category or 'pure' CGE; another 24% (72 patients) were listed as atypical CGE and showed additional minimal focal abnormalities or evidence of insult to the brain in the history. Other conditions giving rise to generalized seizure discharges are hereditary essential myoclonus epilepsy (Lafora-Unverricht-Lundborg), deep seated lesions (hypothalamus, mesencephalon) and metabolic disturbances; this group amounted to no more than 4% (12 patients). A primary cortical epileptogenic focus giving rise to 'secondary bilateral synchrony' was presumed in 9% (26 patients). A large group of 125 patients (42%) were characterized by slow spike-wave complexes and mental retardation (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome). The 4 remaining patients (1%) had slow spike-wave complexes but represented an unusual type of post-traumatic epilepsy without the ictal-clinical symptomatology of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The physiopathogenesis of CGE and its generalized seizure patterns is discussed.",

The diagnosis of hypoglycemia can cause considerable problems, in particular when only isolated single symptoms present (e.g., confusion, psychosis, seizures, coma). For the elective clarification of recurrent hypoglycemia, further diagnostic examinations (e.g., fasting with determination of hormones, measurement of insulin) are employed in addition to the patient's history. For differential diagnostic considerations not only organic causes, but also adverse drug reactions and a factitious genesis must be excluded.

Most authors also agree that fatigue does not depend on overall or motor disability (as measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)3).

Diese beinhalten die Klassifikation einer Intelligenzminderung zur Einschätzung der Autonomie von Patienten, das Beobachten möglicher Nebenwirkungen neu eindosierter Antiepileptika oder Dosissteigerungen, die präoperative neuropsychologische Diagnostik oder die Frage einer zusätzlichen demenziellen Entwicklung. Da die zur Verfügung stehenden neuropsychologischen Instrumente diese Fragen oft nicht ausreichend beantworten können, müssen zusätzlich andere Methoden angewandt werden, um Verhaltensänderungen zu objektivieren oder das erreichte Fertigkeitenniveau zu klassifizieren. Eine Möglichkeit bietet die Erhebung der psychosozialen Anpassung an die Umweltgegebenheiten.

Wie oft neurologische Stoerungen fuer muedigkeitsbedingte Unfaelle verantwortlich sind, ist ebenso nicht bekannt wie die Haeufigkeit chronischer Muedigkeit infolge solcher Stoerungen. Fuer einzelne Krankheiten liegen Schaetzungen vor, exzessive Muedigkeit am Tag tritt zum Beispiel bei Morbus Parkinson (48 Prozent der Patienten) und bei Multipler Sklerose auf (in England bei 40.000 Patienten). Klagen ueber chronische Muedigkeit machen in den gesamten USA zwischen 10 und 15 Millionen Besuche beim Hausarzt aus. Neben neurologischen Erkrankungen sind auch die Folgen anderer Krankheiten (zum Beispiel Schlaganfall), psychiatrische Stoerungen oder die Einnahme von Medikamenten (zum Beispiel blutdrucksenkende Mittel, Beta-Rezeptorenblocker, Lipidsenker) Ursachen fuer das Auftreten starker Ermuedung oder Erschoepfung. In einer Tabelle sind die neurologischen Stoerungen, die starke Muedigkeit hervorrufen, zusammengestellt. Bei einigen der Krankheiten sind neben der Muedigkeit auch kognitive Leistungseinbussen bekannt. Zu den in der Auflistung genannten Stoerungen kommen noch weitere hinzu, die Muedigkeit verursachen, unter anderem Epilepsie, hepatische Enzephalopathie, Vergiftungen und weitere neurodegenerative Erkrankungen wie die Alzheimer-Krankheit. Fahreignung und Fahrtuechtigkeit sind vielfach abhaengig vom Stadium der jeweiligen neurologischen Erkrankung. Zu pruefen bleibt, inwieweit dabei insbesondere Muedigkeit ein zentrales Problem darstellt. Hinweise auf den Zusammenhang zwischen Schlafstoerungen und neurologischen Erkrankungen ergeben sich auch aus einer Befragung der Bundesanstalt fuer Strassenwesen zum Einfluss von Krankheiten und Medikamenteneinnahme auf das Verkehrsverhalten von Personen ab 60 Jahren. Etwa 35 Prozent der Befragten, die an einer neurologischen Erkrankung leiden, berichten ueber Schlafstoerungen. Insgesamt gaben 17 Prozent aller Befragten an, an Schlafstoerungen zu leiden.",

Some symptoms are clustered into syndromes, and provisional operational criteria, such as AD-related psychosis or depression, are proposed to facilitate their study.4,5 These symptoms have serious negative consequences for patients, including compromising quality of life and increasing impairment in activities of daily living. They are also major sources of psychological stress, depression, and burden for the caregivers.6 Studies have shown that these symptoms are linked to elder abuse and are important determinants of the institutionalization of patients with AD.7,8 Neuropsychiatric symptoms reflect the underlying neurobiological changes of the diseased brain, and many can be alleviated by psychotropic medications.9,10 Certain stage-specific patterns of the neuropsychiatric symptoms can be observed during the course of AD,11 and some symptoms may have specific value in the prediction of the disease course. For example, several studies have found that depression is a harbinger of AD;12,13 others have shown that delusions or hallucinations predict clinical or functional decline.14,15Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes cognitive impairment in the elderly not of sufficient severity to meet diagnostic criteria for dementia. It is often a transitional state between normal aging and dementia. Subjects with MCI have memory impairment or other cognitive deficits that may be noticeable to their family. Objective cognitive tests show worse performance than their age-and education-comparable contemporaries. However, their daily function is generally preserved.",

      "abstract": "Early-onset dementia (EOD, &lt;65 years at onset) is a relatively common and frequently misdiagnosed condition. One reason for misdiagnosis is that EOD has a more varied differential diagnosis than late-onset dementia (LOD). For example, Alzheimer's disease (AD), the preponderant LOD, makes up only about one-third of EODs; the rest are due to vascular dementias, frontotemporal lobar degenerations, traumatic head injury, alcohol-related dementia, and a great many other conditions. Another reason for misdiagnosis is that early-onset AD may have predominant cognitive deficits other than memory loss and a potential familial inheritance with spastic paraparesis, seizures, or myoclonus. A third reason is that EOD often presents with neuropsychiatric features out-of-proportion to any cognitive deficits. Despite these obstacles, it is important to accurately diagnose EODs, particularly because they differ in management and course. Clinicians can successfully diagnose most EODs with careful cognitive and family histories, mental status and neurological examinations, and neuroimaging.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The terms subjective and objective often appear in health care records, and one commonly hears about “subjective symptoms” and “objective complaints”—yet the former is redundant and the latter an oxymoron. Objectively verifiable pathology may explain a patient's symptoms, but complaints themselves are never objective but rather, by definition, subjective. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, defines the terminology: Subjective information is more open to interpretation, but objective data are factual, reproducible, and often measurable or quantifiable. Objective findings generally have much higher inter-examiner reliability than subjective findings. Symptoms and most findings on physical (particularly neuromusculoskeletal) examination are subjective. Diagnostic study results and a minority of physical findings are objective. Some physical findings, such as strength and range of motion measurements, are both subjective and objective. Repeat testing, assessment of plausibility, and use of confirmatory physical findings can be used to validate or “objectify” subjective findings (eg, by determining if a weakness is corroborated by other neurologic or physical findings, imaging study results, and/or electrodiagnostic testing). The use of objective, or at least less subjective, findings in impairment rating should improve interrater reliability. Thus, evaluating physicians should not regard subjective complaints and findings, and they should lend greater weight to objective findings.",

      "title": "Seizures: Behavioral",
      "abstract": "Abstract The question of whether an individual has experienced a seizure or has recurrent seizures (epilepsy) is often encountered in the forensic setting. Such questions are often raised in cases of alleged personal injury, usually in cases of apparent brain injury. The impact of seizures in a patient's life is also often at issue in cases involving disability law and employment discrimination. Occasionally, death or injuries related to epilepsy are at issue in the court, or the impact of a mother's use of antiepileptic drugs resulting in apparent birth defects. In the criminal arena, criminal acts are sometimes attributed to seizure activity or to brain dysfunction associated with epilepsy. Classification of seizures and epileptic syndromes are one goal of the assessment of the seizure disorder patient. Diagnostic methods include neurological examination, preferably by a neurologist skilled in the field of epileptology. The evaluation will also likely include EEG testing and brain imaging studies. Careful consideration of differential diagnosis issues is critical, as many medical and psychiatric syndromes closely resemble the presentation of seizure disorder. One key differential is ruling out psychogenic seizures or pseudoseizures. When seizures figure into a potential criminal defense (automatism) for aggressive behavior, careful forensic neurological assessment is warranted to determine the medicolegal validity of such a defense.",

      "abstract": "The neuropathology of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), like Parkinson's disease (PD), is heterogeneous, but most cases have Lewy-related pathology as the major pathologic substrate of parkinsonism. Less common causes of the PDD clinical syndrome include progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Most cases of PDD have diffuse cortical Lewy bodies, medial temporal neurofibrillary degeneration, and neocortical diffuse amyloid deposits. In most cases, Alzheimer-type pathology is not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A subset of cases have concurrent AD, multiple cerebrovascular lesions consistent with vascular dementia, or severe pathology of the isodendritic core of cortically projecting subcortical nuclei with Lewy-related pathology that is relatively restricted to brainstem or limbic areas. Comparable degrees of Lewy-related and Alzheimer-type pathology are sometimes detected in subjects with PD without dementia, which suggests that there are other, yet to be determined, factors that are more proximal causes of cognitive impairment in PDD, such as synaptic loss, deficiencies of neurotransmitters, or the presence of soluble toxic oligomers of Aβ, tau or α-synuclein that lead to neuronal dysfunction.",

It therefore forms an important means of quantifying the NINCDS-AD RDA (McKhann et al., 1984) criteria for a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s disease, which require that there is impairment in memory functioning plus at least one other cognitive domain such as language, praxis, perceptual skills, problem-solving abilities, attention, or orientation, supported by the Folstein Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975), Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (BDRS) (Blessed et al., 1968), or a similar evaluation. These difficulties must interfere with everyday functional capacity. A diagnosis of possible Alzheimer’s disease is rendered when a patient presents with only a single progressive cognitive deficit, an atypical presentation, or when there is a medical or neuropsychiatric condition that might account for observed deficits but is not considered to be the cause of the dementia.",

If neurons die, become dysfunctional, or are disconnected following a challenge, functionality of the affected neural circuit is compromised. Depending on the magnitude and localization, this may have relatively mild consequences (such as a learning deficit) or major consequences (such as developmental delay, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or death). We are interested in selective or regional neuron death because they can help to explain the neurologic dysfunction experienced by an individual or give insight into the pathologic process that preceded death.",

      "abstract": "The assessment of patients with mental health problems is often seen as very different from assessment in other areas of medicine. However, it actually has much in common with any area of medicine in which taking a good history is vital. It should be conducted in a systematic way using good interview techniques. A clear knowledge of signs of mental illness (e.g. delusions, hallucinations) is essential for an accurate assessment of a patient's difficulties. This should allow the clinician to reach a differential diagnosis, and to estimate how much confidence can be placed in the primary diagnosis. Although there are few diagnostic tests in psychiatry, appropriate investigation of patients includes an assessment of their physical health (and whether this might relate to their psychiatric presentation), a formal and detailed assessment of their cognitive function (which can help characterize or localize possible brain pathology), objective ratings of the severity of symptoms, and neuroimaging.",

      "title": "Consanguinity and Mental Disorder",
      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

      "title": "Introduction to psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is the branch of medicine which specializes in the treatment of those brain disorders which pri­marily cause disturbance of thought, behaviour, and emotion. These are often referred to as mental, or psy­chiatric, disorders. The boundary with the specialty of neurology, which also deals with disorders of the cen­tral nervous system, is therefore indistinct. Neurology mainly focuses on brain disease with clear physical pathology and/ or obvious peripheral effects on, for ex­ample, motor function. Mental disorders such as depressive disorder and psychoses have been recognized since antiquity. Modern epidemiological studies have demonstrated that they are both highly prevalent and widely dis­tributed across all societies. Overall, mental disorders account for a very high proportion of the disability experienced by the human race (see Chapter 2). Unfortunately, in most societies mental disorders still do not receive the recognition or a level of health ser­vice commensurate with their public health import­ance. There are several reasons for this. Probably most importantly, the brain is a vastly complex organ and the neural systems underlying mental disorders re­main poorly characterized. This inevitably means that our understanding of the pathophysiology is rela­tively poor compared to disorders such as diabetes or heart disease. The absence of a clear body of reliable scientific evidence means that competing unscien­tific views— and stigma— can flourish. Recently, how­ever, our neurobiological techniques have improved in sophistication and sensitivity to the extent that mental disorders have become tractable problems. Phenomena such as mood symptoms, anxiety, and even psychosis seem to exist on a continuum in the population, and the absence of reliable neurobiological measures creates difficulties in determining where the thresholds lie in the gradual change from normality to illness. In clinical practice, the use of diagnostic cri­teria can increase the reliability of diagnoses and re­duce the variations between clinicians. However, small changes in diagnostic criteria can have large effects on the resulting estimates of the prevalence of disorders. Unfortunately, the criteria themselves are based on very imperfect knowledge about the natural history or boundaries of the disorders.",

      "title": "Hipoglikemijski sindromi - dijagnostički i terapijski pristup i prikaz dva slučaja",
      "abstract": "Prevention of hypoglycemia is essential for preservation of brain metabolism and survival of the whole body. Normally, glucose is only substrate used by the brain to meet its metabolic requirements. When plasma glucose concentration decreases (e.g., during prolonged fasting or after administration of glucose-lowering drugs) several physiological responses are activated to prevent further decreases in blood glucose. The first response is known as counterregulation, a system that prevents and corrects hypoglycemia through the release of counterregulatory hormones. Ultimately traceable to neural glucose deprivation, symptoms of hypoglycemia include neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Neurogenic symptoms (tremulousness, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias) are results of the perception of physiologic changes caused by the autonomic nervous system’s response to hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, sensation of warmth, weakness or fatigue, severe cognitive failure, seizure, coma) are the results of brain glucose deprivation itself. Glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations following recent episodes of hypoglycemia, leading to the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness-loss of warming symptoms of developing hypoglycemia. Thus, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia (e.g. those with tightly controlled diabetes or with an insulinoma) often tolerate abnormal low plasma glucose concentration without symptoms. Classification of symptoms of hypoglycemia, namely reactive versus fasting based on segregation by timing in relation to meals is no longer useful from a clinical point of view. Every patient with neuroglycopenic symptoms regardless of relation to food ingestion, requires comprehensive evaluation. Identification of the possible cause of hypoglycemia and selection of diagnostic modalities are facilitated by considering whether the patients appears to be healthy (with or without compensated coexistent disease) or ill (with a disease known to have a proclivity to develop hypoglycemia, or is hospitalized). Medications may mediate hypoglycemia in anybody, whether they appear healthy or ill. Optimal condition for confirming the presence and accurately diagnosing the type of hypoglycemic disorder occurs at the time of spontaneous spell. Otherwise, dynamic testing to generate conductive conditions should be conducted in any patients with a history of neuroglycopenic symptoms, regardless of relation to meal ingestion. Specific criteria regarding beta-cell polypeptide concentrations are required to establish hyperinsulinemia. Sulfonylureas in plasma should be measured with sensitive assays. Surgical management of insulinoma begins with simply considering the diagnosis then proceeding to establish absolutely the biochemical diagnosis.",

Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "title": "Transient neurologic symptoms",
      "abstract": "Transient neurologic symptoms are common in clinical practice and can take many forms (eg, loss of consciousness, confusion, vertigo, seizures, drop attacks, behavioral abnormalities). They are often subtle and episodic and their source can be the central nervous, cardiovascular, metabolic, or endocrine system, or they can be caused by space-occupying lesions. A detailed knowledge of such symptoms and their possible causes is invaluable to confidently approach the problem in a systematic manner. Evaluation should begin with careful history taking and physical examination for intercurrent illness and a baseline set of tests. Investigation usually includes computed tomography of the brain and often magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and/or electroencephalography as well. Further, specific studies are chosen on the basis of the suspected diagnosis and the information being sought.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), alone or in combination with other pathology, is the most common cause of dementia in people over age 65. The defining features of Alzheimer's dementia are progressive deficits in memory and other aspects of cognition, typically including language, praxis, visual and spatial processing, and executive function at some point during the course of the illness. Noncognitive phenomena, including apathy and unawareness, are important contributors to the burden of disease. At the same time, elemental neurological function, and therefore the general neurological exam, is usually normal, although paratonia and/or myoclonus may be present. These deficits result in reduced ability to perform daily activities, and most Alzheimer's dementia patients will become totally dependent on others unless they die of other causes first. The clinical presentation of Alzheimer's dementia is the result of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss that follow a predictable distribution in the brain. The hippocampus, limbic cortex, and polymodal association cortex sustain the greatest damage. Dysfunction in these regions results in the characteristic clinical pattern of Alzheimer's dementia and assists in its clinical differentiation from other dementing illnesses, which follow different anatomical patterns of neuronal dysfunction.",

Es bleibt festzuhalten, dass neben der Anamnese eine eingehende neuropsychologische Testung die wichtigste Untersuchung zur Diagnose kognitiver Defizite darstellt. Weiterhin ist wichtig, dass neben einer spezifischen antidementiven Therapie zunächst die leitliniengerechte Therapie der Grunderkrankung im Vordergrund steht. Häufig kann so ein Progress der kognitiven Defizite verzögert oder verhindert werden.",

      "abstract": "La posesión demoníaca, descrita por innumerables culturas a lo largo de la historia, sigue siendo actualmente un tema a discutir dentro del debate entre ciencia y religión. Este ensayo reflexivo, se ha propuesto analizar el fenómeno y abordarlo desde diversas perspectivas psicológicas que nos brinden una posible explicación lógica y coherente del suceso con el fin de esclarecerlo frente a las supersticiones de la cultura a través del método hermenéutico. Los signos de los posesos pueden deberse a otros factores, tanto neurobiológicos como psicológicos, como, por ejemplo, la aversión a los objetos religiosos y el surgimiento de una segunda personalidad, puede deberse a un cuadro de trastorno conversivo (neurosis) o presentarse en la esquizofrenia (psicosis), y la amnesia después del episodio puede deberse a la sobrecarga funcional del cerebro. Existen otros signos más complejos de explicar, como lo son el hablar en lenguas diferentes o la levitación; el primero lo trataremos descriptivamente desde el síndrome del idioma extranjero, que puede presentarse producto de factores neurológicos o en la misma psicosis, y la levitación podemos verla desde la física, con la llamada levitación magnética, a través de una hipótesis en la cual esta condición podría cumplirse en los seres humanos debido a la sobreexcitación cerebral que generaría cierto campo magnético. Finalmente, dentro de los aportes del psicoanálisis encontramos la neurosis como forma en que se manifiesta este fenómeno y damos por concluido que la posesión demoníaca se debe a dos sucesos: neurosis o psicosis, recalcando la importancia del análisis del contexto para realizar criterios diferenciadores en nuestro diagnóstico psicológico.",

      "abstract": "Described over a century ago, schizophrenia still presents personal, clinical and scientific challenges, and is increasingly considered a concept rather than a single disorder. It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

Psychiatrists see such patients in liaison settings and clinics for those with psychotic and affective disorders. The pathophysiology remains obscure; physical investigations are usually performed to exclude pathology rather than elucidate dysfunction. However, modern neuroimaging has allowed the study of nervous system structure and function. Although there are few diagnostically specific findings, patterns of association have emerged: where action is impeded (certain forms of conversion disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome) frontal systems of the brain are often implicated; when subjective awareness of the body is disturbed (passivity phenomena and anorexia nervosa) temporo-parietal cortices appear to be dysfunctional. The caudate nuclei (components of the frontal executive circuit) are implicated in a variety of syndromes (including body dysmorphic disorder, somatisation and chronic fatigue). The brain may be viewed as a cognitive neurobiological entity, crucially oriented towards action (for survival). Psychiatric syndromes that have an impact on bodily awareness signal dysfunction within systems representing that body and its performance in time and space.",

      "title": "Cognitive impairment in heart failure",
      "abstract": "The clinical syndrome of heart failure is one of the leading causes of hospitalisation and mortality in older adults. Due to ageing of the general population and improved survival from cardiac disease the prevalence of heart failure is rising. Despite the fact that the majority of patients with heart failure are aged over 65 years old, many with multiple co-morbidities, the association between cognitive impairment and heart failure has received relatively little research interest compared to other aspects of cardiac disease. \r\n\r\nThe presence of concomitant cognitive impairment has implications for the management of patients with heart failure in the community. There are many evidence based pharmacological therapies used in heart failure management which obviously rely on patient education regarding compliance. Also central to the treatment of heart failure is patient self-monitoring for signs indicative of clinical deterioration which may prompt them to seek medical assistance or initiate a therapeutic intervention e.g. taking additional diuretic. Adherence and self-management may be jeopardised by cognitive impairment.\r\nFormal diagnosis of cognitive impairment requires evidence of abnormalities on neuropsychological testing (typically a result ≥1.5 standard deviation below the age-standardised mean) in at least one cognitive domain. Cognitive impairment is associated with an increased risk of dementia and people with mild cognitive impairment develop dementia at a rate of 10-15% per year, compared with a rate of 1-2% per year in healthy controls.1 Cognitive impairment has been reported in a variety of cardiovascular disorders. It is well documented among patients with hypertension, atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, especially after coronary artery bypass grafting. This background is relevant to the study of patients with heart failure as many, if not most, have a history of one or more of these co-morbidities. \r\n\r\nA systematic review of the literature to date has shown a wide variation in the reported prevalence of cognitive impairment in heart failure. This range in variation probably reflects small study sample sizes, differences in the heart failure populations studied (inpatients versus outpatients), neuropsychological tests employed and threshold values used to define cognitive impairment. The main aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of cognitive impairment in a representative sample of heart failure patients and to examine whether this association was due to heart failure per se rather than the common cardiovascular co-morbidities that often accompany it such as atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation.\r\n\r\nOf the 817 potential participants screened, 344 were included in this study. The study cohort included 196 patients with HF, 61 patients with ischaemic heart disease and no HF and 87 healthy control participants. The HF cohort consisted of 70 patients with HF and coronary artery disease in sinus rhythm, 51 patients with no coronary artery disease in sinus rhythm and 75 patients with HF and atrial fibrillation. All patients with HF had evidence of HF-REF with a LVEF <45% on transthoracic echocardiography. The majority of the cohort was male and elderly. HF patients with AF were more likely to have multiple co-morbidities. \r\n\r\nPatients recruited from cardiac rehabilitation clinics had proven coronary artery disease, no clinical HF and a LVEF >55%. The ischaemic heart disease group were relatively well matched to healthy controls who had no previous diagnosis of any chronic illness, prescribed no regular medication and also had a LVEF >55%. All participants underwent the same baseline investigations and there were no obvious differences in baseline demographics between each of the cohorts. \r\n\r\nAll 344 participants attended for 2 study visits. Baseline investigations including physiological measurements, electrocardiography, echocardiography and laboratory testing were all completed at the initial screening visit. Participants were then invited to attend their second study visit within 10 days of the screening visit. 342 participants completed all neuropsychological assessments (2 participants failed to complete 1 questionnaire). A full comprehensive battery of neuropsychological assessment tools were administered in the 90 minute study visit. These included three global cognitive screening assessment tools (mini mental state examination, Montreal cognitive assessment tool and the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status) and additional measures of executive function (an area we believe has been understudied to date). In total there were 9 cognitive tests performed. These were generally well tolerated. Data were also collected using quality of life questionnaires and health status measures. In addition to this, carers of the study participant were asked to complete a measure of caregiver strain and an informant questionnaire on cognitive decline.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of cognitive impairment varied significantly depending on the neuropsychological assessment tool used and cut-off value used to define cognitive impairment. Despite this, all assessment tools showed the same pattern of results with those patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation having poorer cognitive performance than those with heart failure in sinus rhythm. Cognitive impairment was also more common in patients with cardiac disease (either coronary artery disease or heart failure) than age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls, even after adjustment for common vascular risk factors.",

Sie sind charakterisiert durch Symptome wie Oberbauchschmerzen, Vollegefuhl etc. sowie durch das Fehlen struktureller Lasionen oder biochemischer Abnormalitaten, die diese Symptome erklaren. Die funktionelle Dyspepsie mit auf den Oberbauch bezogenen chronischen oder chronisch rezidivierenden Symptomen ist dabei eine der wichtigsten Erkrankungen, die in der Klinik Anlass gibt fur endoskopische Untersuchungen.\r\nHinsichtlich der Pathogenese der Symptome wird heute angenommen, dass neben Motilitatsstorungen vor allem Veranderungen der gastrointestinalen Sensorik eine zentrale Rolle einnehmen. So sind bei Patienten im Vergleich zu gesunden Probanden die Schwellen fur die Wahrnehmung und das Auftreten von Beschwerden bei mechanischer Distension des Magens signifikant niedriger als bei gesunden Probanden . Neben Unterschieden hinsichtlich der Wahrnehmungsschwellen sind Patienten gekennzeichnet durch gestorte adaptive Veranderungen der Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation oder einer mukosalen Schleimhautschadigung durch nicht-steroidale Antirheumatika (NSAR). Ziel der vorliegenden Untersuchung war es, den Einfluss opioiderger Bahnen fur die Modulation viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen zu erfassen und die Effekte bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie und gesunden Probanden zu vergleichen. In Ubereinstimmung mit anderen fruheren Arbeiten findet sich bei Gesunden ein Anstieg viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation und Behandlung mit NSAR, wahrend die Schwellen bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie abnehmen. Die Gabe von Naloxon, einem unspezifischen Opioidantagonisten, bewirkt bei Gesunden einen signifikant starker ausgepragten Abfall viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen als bei Patienten. Die Daten lassen insofern den Schluss zu, dass \r\na) bei Patienten offensichtlich antinozizeptive Bahnen nur eingeschrankt funktionstuchtig sind; \r\nb) b) dies auf eine Storung opioiderg vermittelter antinozizeptiver Effekte zuruckzufuhren ist, was die verminderte Antwort auf intravenos appliziertes Naloxon bei Patienten nahe legt.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cognition is the action or faculty of knowing—knowledge—implying consciousness. The complex faculty is taken to include orientation, attention, memory, language functions, gnosis, visual perception, comprehension, abstraction, reasoning, constructional praxis, judgement, and new learning. Definitions of dementia emphasize memory loss, the presence of other cognitive disturbances, a progressive course, and the presence of diffuse brain disease. Thus the DSM-IIIR criteria for probable Alzheimer’s disease require the presence of dementia; deficits in two or more areas of cognition; progression; normal consciousness; and the absence of other diagnosable pathologies. The diagnosis is supported by progressive deterioration of specific cognitive skills; impaired Activities of Daily Living and inappropriate behaviour; positive family history; normal cerebrospinal fluid; normal electro-encephalography (EEG) or non-specific changes only; and CT evidence of cerebral atrophy. But to require the absence of other pathologies begs the question as to the diagnosis and makes the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease one of exclusion. In this chapter, we will survey briefly those conditions which fulfil many of the criteria for Alzheimer’s disease but exhibit physical signs or other clinical features which disallow that diagnosis. As there are so many of them, those occurring less frequently are included in an appendix at the end of this chapter.",

B. ausdünnendes Haar, Falten, Größe oder Form der Nase), was zu signifikanten Beeinträchtigungen in sozialen oder beruflichen Lebensbereichen führt. Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> Workers in the various fields of child behavior have long been aware that mental disturbances of different kinds result, in some patients, from some type and degree of organic defect causing either generalized or localized impairment of function of brain tissue. The pathological manifestations of cerebral damage are usually believed to be of two general types—first, those symptoms which result directly from the loss of or damage to cerebral tissue, and, second, symptoms not directly associated with tissue loss, but, rather, symptoms of indirect or \"superimposed\" psychological disturbances, e.g., the patient's reactions to or attitudes toward disability occasioned by brain damage. Evidence of cerebral dysfunction may show up in one or more areas, such as sensory or motor function, intellectual functioning, emotional control, manifestation of seizure phenomena, and others. In medicine, the classical picture of the brain-injured child has traditionally included some motor defect as a primary condition. Beginning",

      "title": "Fall or Shaken: Traumatic Brain Injury in Children Caused by Falls or Abuse at Home - A Review on Biomechanics and Diagnosis",
      "abstract": "In cases of traumatic brain injuries in children it may be difficult to differentiate between physical abuse and accidental occurrence. This review will shed light on discriminating epidemiological as well as biomechanical data, morphological findings, and clinical features. As a basic principle, simple injuries are caused by simple mechanisms like falls whereas life-threatening injuries should be attributed to abuse until proven otherwise. Implausibilities between reported events and mechanisms by caregivers as well as more than one explanation of injury indicate suspicion of child abuse. From reviewing the literature, it can be stated that falls from less than 1.5 m lead only in few cases to severe brain injuries. Children who experienced a fall at home seldom exhibit fractures of the skull but just minor intracranial injuries without neurological deficits. Regarding biomechanical aspects, multiple or complex skull fractures, depression fractures, additional fractures of the body, and intracranial hemorrhages as a consequence of an impact are the most important findings in child abuse. Moreover, additional specific morphological criteria give evidence of clinical and/or post-mortem diagnosis of the shaken baby syndrome. These include subdural hemorrhage and laceration of the brain and retinal bleeding, epidural hemorrhage of the cervical cord, gripping marks (bruises) on chest and/or shoulders, and tearing injuries of the throat and neck muscles. Post-mortem signs of recurrent shaken baby syndrome are indicated by iron-positive cells or microglial cells in neuronal or retinal tissue. A clinical diagnosis will be dependent on the one hand on the exclusion of coagulation diseases, on the other hand on the demonstration of a subdural hemorrhage by means of neuroimaging techniques, i.e., CT and MRI, as well as retinal hemorrhage. The shaken baby syndrome will usually be observed within the first year of life. The doctor has to manifest his diagnosis to the caregivers and - before informing the caregivers - he must be sure of his diagnosis.",

Occasionally AD may simulate other disorders such as supranuclear palsy, corticobasal ganglionar degeneration and Jacob-Creutzfeldt disease. Finally, there are mixed forms, in which AD is associated with cerebrovascular disease (very commonly) and with other diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies.

      "abstract": "Our classification of the mental disorders of later life, which are becoming a social and medical problem of increasing magnitude, is still based upon the views of the great descriptive psychiatrists of half a century ago. Most of the classical accounts of mental disorder of old age (Kraepelin, 1909; Bleuler, 1916) confine themselves to the pre-senile, senile and arteriosclerotic psychoses. Their writers evidently regarded other illnesses as numerically insignificant in relation to these degenerative disorders peculiar to old age. Cases with a predominantly depressive or paranoid picture or with clouding of consciousness alone were described in these old accounts, but were attributed to an underlying cerebral illness, either of senile or arteriosclerotic type. It is consequently a long-established practice when such symptoms appear for the first time in old age, or occur in senescence after prolonged remission, to search for neurological signs, or for some evidence of a decline in intellectual efficiency which might account for the illness in terms of organic disease of the brain. Weight is thus often given to clinical findings of a quite subtle character, or the results of “deterioration tests” whose value in the early diagnosis of degenerative processes in the brain is unproven, form the basis of conclusions of doubtful validity.",

      "title": "The clinical assessment of the patient with early dementia",
      "abstract": "ementia is a clinical state characterised by a loss of function in at least two cognitive domains.When making a diagnosis of dementia, features to look for include memory impairment and at least one of the following: aphasia, apraxia, agnosia and/or disturbances in executive functioning.To be significant the impairments should be severe enough to cause problems with social and occupational functioning and the decline must have occurred from a previously higher level.It is important to exclude delirium when considering such a diagnosis.When approaching the patient with a possible dementia, taking a careful history is paramount.Clues to the nature and aetiology of the disorder are often found following careful consultation with the patient and carer.A focused cognitive and physical examination is useful and the presence of specific features may aid in diagnosis.Certain investigations are mandatory and additional tests are recommended if the history and examination indicate particular aetiologies.It is useful when assessing a patient with cognitive impairment in the clinic to consider the following straightforward questions: c Is the patient demented?c If so, does the loss of function conform to a characteristic pattern?c Does the pattern of dementia conform to a particular pattern?c What is the likely disease process responsible for the dementia?An understanding of cognitive function and its anatomical correlates is necessary in order to ascertain which brain areas are affected.This, in turn, aids diagnosis.A discussion of the localisation of all cognitive processes is beyond the scope of this review.It is, however, particularly important to have an understanding of memory and its subdivisions, which is necessary to aid in differential diagnosis.We shall then illustrate how the history and examination, including bedside cognitive testing, are used in diagnosis. TYPES OF MEMORY cWhen considering any memory disorder it is important to have an understanding of the main ''types'' of memory; otherwise erroneous use of the term ''short term memory'' may cause confusion. 1Memory can be thought of in terms of working memory, episodic memory (anterograde and retrograde), semantic memory, remote memory, and implicit memory (table 1).Classically, early Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes defects in anterograde episodic memory (for example, the ability to remember an address after five minutes or longer). 2 The relevance of this is that aspects of memory are subserved by different structures.Certain disease processes have a tendency to start focally and progress in a typical anatomical pattern.They have, therefore, a largely predictable neuropsychological signature.For example, initially AD pathology tends to be perihippocampal, then spreads to temporo-parietal association cortex and latterly involves frontal lobes.This is mirrored by the initial cognitive deficit of anterograde episodic memory, progressing to attentional, semantic memory and visuo-perceptual impairment, with personality change occurring as a later feature. TAKING A HISTORY AND THE EXAMINATION OF THE MEMORY IMPAIRED PATIENTIt is vital to obtain a corroborating history from a relative or close friend in addition to the patient's account if they can provide one.The need to physically examine the patient, looking for signs pointing to a particular cause, is discussed below. History takingIt is useful to interview the patient and the accompanying person separately.The absence of a concerned relative or friend at the appointment may lessen the likelihood of dementia in a patient complaining of memory problems.Interviewing the patient separately enables the cooperation and language skills to be assessed without them being masked by interruptions or assistance from a third party.It also allows an assessment into the degree of insight of the affected individual.Conversation with the patient may be as important as any formal cognitive assessment.The presence of word finding difficulties, paraphasic errors, and inappropriate behaviour is helpful in v15",

      "title": "Anorexia in Exercise and Sport",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders that are associated with severe disturbances in eating behavior are called “eating disorders.” According to the American Psychiatric Association1, a mental disorder consists of “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” Of particular attention here is the eating disorder of anorexia nervosa. This disorder amounts to a refusal to maintain a normal body weight. In the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV, pp. 544–545), the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (See Table 1) are associated with physical symptoms (abnormal body weight, amenorrhea) and psychological symptoms (fear in gaining weight and body image disturbances).Table 1: A. Diagnostic Criteria for Anorexia NervosaDiscussion: Although the incidence of clinically diagnosed anorexia nervosa is only about 1% in the U.S. population, its prevalence among athletes in sports that emphasize leanness has been estimated to be much higher. Part of this confusion comes from misinterpreting scores on questionnaires such as the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI) or the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). These standardized instruments are not designed to determine psychopathology since it takes a clinical interview to determine if the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria are met. Instead, the EDI and EAT are useful in determining who might be at risk for meeting the diagnostic criteria of anorexia nervosa. Athletes in sports that emphasize leanness will often have elevated scores on the drive for thinness scale of the EDI2. However, when athletes are subjected to a clinical interview, most of those classified as “at risk,” are not found to have a true clinical relevant “eating disorder.” Higher scores on the EDI, for instance, may be only be a rationale response on the part of the athlete and may not represent a clinical eating disorder. As O'Connor and Smith3 have pointed out, a higher drive for thinness score may merely represent a desire to perform well, especially in light of the time the athlete has devoted to the sport. Evidence from several sources suggests that athletes are more apt to have “subclinical or disordered eating patterns,” particularly when their sports are in-season. However, the disordered eating patterns seen in most athletes are not of the severity that would qualify as a clinically diagnosed eating disorder.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that result from progressive damage to cells and nervous system connections that are essential for mobility, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognition. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Neurological disorders are disorders that involve the brain, spinal cord or nerve and muscle. Children with neurological disorders may have disorders such as epilepsy, developmental delay, cerebral palsy, meningitis, genetic/metabolic diseases or diseases of muscle or nerve such as muscular dystrophy or peripheral neuropathy. These illnesses are frequently severe and potentially have long lasting consequences for the affected children. The pathologies most frequently responsible for psycho-physical disorders can be summarized into three groups: collaboration difficulties (autism spectrum disorders, intellectual impairment, phobia); motor dysfunction (cerebral palsy, epilepsy, other brain pathologies, neuromuscular disorders), and craniofacial anomalies (Down syndrome, other genetic syndromes). Due to their clinical history, and the lack of collaboration, in pediatric non-cooperative patients with Special Needs (SN), the anesthesiological risk may result difficult to assess, despite the fact that they meet the criteria of the outpatient management applied for the patient without disabilities. The perioperative management of pediatric patients with psycho-physical disorders with related relational and cognitive problems must be carefully planned, in order to make the entire hospitalization process as comfortable and as less traumatic as possible. General anesthesia is the most suitable type of anesthesia in pediatric patients with Special Needs (SN), although anesthetic complications are more frequent in these patients, mainly due to comorbidities, taken drugs and anatomical peculiarities. Some studies observed no correlation between multiple anesthesia exposures and neurodevelopmental deficits, while others reported that even a single exposure could increase the risk of deficits. An increased risk of developmental or behavioral disorders as the consequence of surgeries requiring general anesthesia was observed. Based on current studies, it is necessary to endeavor to limit the duration and numbers of anesthesia and the dose of anesthetic agents. The evaluation must include history and physical examination pertaining to the conditions requiring special anaesthetic considerations. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing these neurological disorders in pediatric patients to improve overall quality of life and long-term outcomes.",

      "title": "Research into the Informational Underload (Sensory Deprivation) Hypothesis of Mental Illness: Preliminary Report",
      "abstract": "Five assumptions, leading to and defining the hypothesis of the ‘informational underload syndrome’ of psychotic mental illness exhibiting hallucinosis, are described: 1. All clinically and experimentally occurring hallucinatory syndromes have, in spite of their differences, a common neurophysiological pattern; 2. Psychiatry has studied the neurophysiological aspects of ‘sensory deprivation’ or ‘sensory restriction’ inadequately; this study may hold important clues for our understanding of mental illness; 3. We assume, in spite of insufficient scientifically tenable evidence so far, that experimental conditions described under the label ‘sensory deprivation’ or ‘sensory restriction’ represent a unitary condition; 4. For its normal functioning the brain depends on both stored information as well as on continuously new extra-cerebral input; if the extracerebral inflow of new information falls below a certain threshold, then the brain must rely mainly on stored information and is assumed to develop a ‘state of informational underload’ which in due course may be characterized electrophysiologically. This pattern is thought to be at the basis of external behavioural manifestations of the sensory deprivation experiments; 5. Genetic, metabolic, degenerative, toxic, faulty learning and other pathogenetic processes may interfere with the sensory input regulating system, thus possibly leading to ‘informational underload’, which might be at the basis of some clinical psychiatric syndromes in which an analogy with sensory deprivation experiments cannot be recognized. The described research attempts to answer whether different sensory deprivation experiments represent one common condition (‘informational underload’) and if so how this condition may be characterized neurophysiologically. Cats, living in colony fashion are used. The experimental set-up and the data acquisition system is then described, involving the study of auditory, visual, proprioceptive and other experimental parameters, singly or in combinations. Six electroencephalographic traces are obtained before and during the experimentation and stored on electromagnetic tape. Resting activity as well as reactivity to visual and auditory repetitive stimultations (evoked cortical responses) are under study, in which topographical interrelations are stressed rather than localized or generally occurring events. The data-analysis system is discussed, involving analogue to digital conversion with the help of the IBM 1710 computer and eventually the mathematical procedures of autocorrelation, autospectral analysis, cross-correlation and cross-spectral analysis, concerning resting activity as executed by the IBM 7094 computer. For evoked responses a computer of analogue transients is presently in use. Changes in evoked potentials are noticed under different experimental conditions. Concerning resting activity the preliminary impression is that there seems to occur a phenomenon characterized by fewer rhythms, the centre of which moves toward the lower frequency range. It is, however, far too early to allow for statistical analysis of groups of animals which have been subjected to the same experiment in order to establish statistical tendencies.",

Common mental health problems often present atypically in older individuals; and loss of physical abilities, financial resources, and family and friends can challenge even the most resilient amongst older people. As part of comprehensive diagnostic workup, neuroimaging such as non-contrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are recommended for all older adults with significant cognitive deficits, new-onset mood or psychotic symptoms accompanied by subtle neurological symptoms, or general physical symptoms.",

      "title": "Clinical, methodological and theoretical issues in the assessment of cognition after anaesthesia and surgery",
      "abstract": "As people live longer, the burden of cognitive impairment to elderly patients, their families and society becomes increasingly common and important. The loss of independence, a reduction in the quality of life and increased mortality are possible correlates to the mental disintegration. Cognitive dysfunction following major surgery on the elderly is a significant problem which adds to other cognitive impairments caused by neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular impairments and other causes. There are challenges in reviewing the literature because of many methodological concerns. There is no standard definition; the diagnosis is made only by the results of neuropsychological tests which are not standardised for this purpose; test results are analysed by different statistical methods (some of them inappropriate); controls are often absent or poorly matched; and pre-existing mild cognitive impairment, which affects 10 to 20% of people older than 65 years and is similar to the subtle cognitive impairment following surgery, is not sought for and recognised. Reviews of the subject have varied from descriptions such as ‘a well recognised and significant problem’ to ‘a hypothetical phenomenon for which there is no International Statistical Classification of Disease (ICD-9) code, and no Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) code’. This article examines both sides of the spectrum in a detailed review which explains the necessary psychological ‘jargon’, discusses the methods used and points to areas of future research.",

Chronic pain of the musculoskeletal system is often a pathologic reaction against the stress. Because a correlation between physical symptoms and psychological stress factors has been observed, chronic pain can be regarded as a representative form of psychosomatic disease. To improve efficacy in the medical treatment or psychotherapy, it is important to understand the psychosocial condition of chronic pain through sufficient history taking or appropriate psychological tests. For the pharmacological treatment of such chronic pain modified with psychosomatic factors, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be more effective than general analgesics or physical therapy.

      "title": "Cell-based therapies for neural replacement strategies in stroke-related neurodegeneration: neurophysiological insights into stem progenitor cell neurogenesis within a host environment",
      "abstract": "The restricted neurogenesis limits the brain ability to overcome neuronal cell death following ischemic lesion: Failure of the damaged brain to regenerate following cerebral ischemia results in functional deficits those are most often irreversible and can further deteriorate, causing mortality and severe disability, progressive memory loss and cognitive impairments, known as dementia. This is caused by massive neuronal cell death and neurotoxicity following limited blood supply to the brain. Ischemic death of brain neurons (acute or delayed after lesion) has been the etiology of vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Multiple types of vascular dementia exist, common in cognitive decline that gradually worsens and variable in where strokes happen (subcortical dementia) or how severe lesions are (e.g., major stroke, series of small strokes or brief transient ischemic attacks). It has emerged a synergistic combination of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease that often comes (mixed dementia). For over the last three decades after the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death had been discovered, intense research has been focused on withdrawing or, at least, attenuating neurodegeneration to improve restoring function in experimental models of post-stroke cognitive impairments while mimicking focal ischemia, permanent or transient brain lesions, hypertension or reproducing Alzheimer's disease combined with vascular pathology [for review (Hainsworth et al., 2017)]. Long-standing perspectives that ischemic neuronal death might be potentially suspended through activation of endogenous neuroprotection stay with genomic reprogramming and/or gene activation for de novo protein synthesis, relied on the hypoxia-activated signaling pathways (Dirnagl et al., 2009). On the other hands, pre-clinical studies, including our own works (Kopach et al., 2016; Rybachuk et al., 2017), have reported functional impairments at the later times (weeks) post-ischemia (as in principal neurons as within network), with controversial effectiveness of pharmacological therapeutics utilized after lesion. Unfulfilled regeneration convinces experimental neuroscientists to focus on cell-based therapies for neuronal replacement strategies used to overcome massive neuronal loss in the brain tissue subjected to ischemia. The major issue, however, remains how this therapy should be utilized in order to promote beneficial effects timely, namely via engraftment of neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) or already differentiated stem cell-derived neurons into the damaged brain. From that, the other conceptual question arises regarding the regulatory role of a host environment in either NSPC neurogenesis or functional integration of the grafted stem cell-derived cells. If choose the latter, what 'proper' proportion of the entirely different phenotypes needs to be grafted to possibly succeed? More insights into this are essential when considering cell therapy while aiming at remodeling of the damaged post-stroke brain from mixed stem cell-derived cells for restoring the broken functionality of such a complex tissue as the brain. NSPC grafts mature neuronal phenotype within a host tissue in a weeks' time: The survival rate of differentiated stem cell-derived cells grafted into the organized brain tissue has been routinely low – this suggests a strong regulatory role of the host environment in the viability of stem cells. As an alternative, grafting NSPCs could potentially promote the multipotent stem cell differentiation and subsequent maturation of the entirely different phenotypes, regulated by endogenous environment, to pave the way towards 'self-repair' of damaged tissue while engaging the endogenous mechanisms of self-renewal. However, discoveries in this field are hampered by technical challenges and controversy in clinically translatable advances. Eventually, the enormous potential of stem cell therapy has been evidenced for post-stroke recovery (Tornero et al., 2017) while its neurophysiological basis has been much less learned thus far. Repeatedly reported common patterns of firing and synaptic activity have been recorded from the stem cell-derived neurons at the very end time-points – typically few months after transplantation – that fosters underestimation of the time-dependent neurophysiological integration of differentiated cells into the host tissue. In our recent study, we have traced the time courses of maturation and integration of the NSPC-derived neurons into the host circuits, demonstrating their matured excitability and synaptogenesis (to the level of endogenous principal neurons – CA1 pyramidal neurons) within 3 weeks or less in situ (Kopach et al., 2018). To neurophysiological point of view, biophysical properties (Na+/K+ conductance, capability for high-frequency firing, characteristic excitatory transmission) make these cells physiologically credible those are capable to constitute specified relationships with other cells, providing functional impact. This also points out the accelerated rate of neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts in situ when compared with much longer time required to achieve similar patterns of activity by stem cell-derived neurons in vitro (Morgan et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2012; Telezhkin et al., 2016). For restorative neuroscience, a query remains to precisely define the timing of NSPC-derived phenotypes mature and set the appropriate activity within the damaged, pathophysiological environment. Establishing this is primary to enabling the assessment of timing for emerging beneficial effects, to design and rationale further reaching perspectives for accelerating stem cell neurogenesis while considering replacement strategies for various post-stroke brain regions (subpopulations of neurons, other neural cell types). Post-ischemic environment regulates neurogenesis of NSPC grafts: An in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia provides technological advantages for feasibly exploring the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death together with managing therapeutic approaches for targeted interventions in the organized brain tissue. In translational neuroscience, this methodology benefits with a meaningful consideration of variable experimental modifications utilized to mimic ischemic insult and onset of cell therapy (depending on how severe and complex the ischemic impairments are, diverse stem cell origin, etc.). In our study of an in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia optimized for a delayed death of principal neurons [within 2 weeks instead of acute CA1 neuronal death (Rybachuk et al., 2017)], we have traced the functional properties of NSPC grafts over the time in the hippocampal tissue subjected to ischemia (Figure 1; Kopach et al., 2018). The post-ischemic environment influenced neurogenesis of NSPC grafts in different ways. Neuronal maturation has been delayed, both excitability and synaptogenesis, at each time points tested (for over 3 weeks in total; Figure 1). Instead, multipotent NSPC differentiation has been prompted towards the non-neuronal phenotype – we have identified the NSPC-derived glial cells as fast as within a week in the post-ischemic tissue. Such principal difference in the stem cell fate between control and post-ischemic environments implies the determinant, yet underestimated, regulatory role of the host tissue in neurogenesis of NSPCs, both differentiation profile (neuronal vs. non-neuronal) and neurophysiological maturation.Figure 1: The experimental scheme of neural stem progenitor cell (NSPC) administration in an in situ model of stroke.A carton shows the time course for functional assessment of the NSPC-derived neural maturation in a host tissue (organotypic hippocampal tissue subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation of 10 minutes duration, with onset of the therapy after 2 hours (h) of re-oxygenation). W: Week(s).Endogenous facilitators of stem cell fate: Ischemic cell damage results in the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity followed by massive neuronal death and overwhelmed neurotoxicity. Ultimately, different signaling molecules and mediators are released those levels became dramatically heightened, overloading the extracellular matrix and activating a vast majority of signaling pathways, with an immense variety of molecular mechanisms being involved. Moreover, during neuronal cell death, necrotic, pro-apoptotic factors and mediators of inflammation activate pro-inflammatory signaling, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and others, pertinent to overactivated astrocytic response featuring the post-ischemic brain. Numerous signaling cascades can, thus, contribute to how the ischemia-subjected environment governs the fate of NSPC grafts. The notable regulatory roles in stem cell differentiation have been evidenced for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), Ca2+-dependent Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), and Wnt signaling pathways in in vitro and in vivo studies, among the involved cAMP, protein kinase C (PKC) and CaMK pathways, and phospholipase C and D signaling activation (Le Belle et al., 2011; Telezhkin et al., 2016). Therefore, pharmacological or genetic manipulations modulating presently dissecting signaling pathways, providing multiple growth facilitators, such as neurotrophins, to support intrinsic growth capacity of differentiating neurons, neutralizing high levels of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the post-ischemic tissue can accelerate neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts. Further, the supposed beneficial effects may include neurogenesis of the resident neural stem cells of the brain for activating endogenous self-renewal. By contrast, the non-neural (glial) NSPC differentiation, prompted up in the post-ischemic tissue, assumes the ROS-mediated regulation of NSPCs. The activated Notch signaling eliciting the latent neurogenic program in astrocytes after stoke (Magnusson et al., 2014) may have a synergistic effect on the post-ischemic NSPC differentiation to astrocytes. Functional restoration via multipotent NSPC function: Outcome after cell therapy is mediated by diverse mechanisms underlying functional improvements in the post-stroke recovery. Our study implies that NSPC therapy comprised primarily of promoted neurogenesis to a glial lineage that emerges shortly after initiating the therapy in the ischemia-subjected brain tissue (Kopach et al., 2018). This initial stage includes supplying the damaged tissue with the NSPC-derived astrocytes and oligodendrocytes – the output assuming the glia-related neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. The stem cell-derived astrocytes enhance the viability of brain cells by secreting various neurotrophic factors and supporting cell regeneration, evidenced for improving neurological function of post-stroke brain (Jiang et al., 2013), whereas oligodendrocytes' role has been proven in re-myelination and axon regeneration, both essential to synaptic networking (Figure 2). Such glial-directed differentiation of NSPC grafts, driven by overactivated master regulators that heavily burden the post-ischemic tissue, may mirror endogenous mechanism of boosting the glia-mediated tissue clearance following ischemic neuronal cell death. As the cellular debris became cleared and pro-apoptotic and inflammatory mediators recede, multipotent NSPC neurogenesis towards neuronal maturation takes place, which is the longer lasting process. Indeed, the ability of multipotent stem cells to mature with higher efficacy to neurons in astrocyte co-cultures had been evidenced. Other roles of glial cells have included the active astrocytic contribution to synapse formation, plasticity and remodeling that should facilitate network remodeling in the post-stroke tissue.Figure 2: The current concept of NSPC-therapy in stroke-related neurodegeneration encompasses the multipotent differentiation of NSPC grafts in a host tissue for replacement of various neural phenotypes after ischemia-induced cell loss for restoring the function in multiple ways.Conclusions and future perspectives: Ischemia-induced neuronal cell death is one of the leading causes of the brain damage that results in high rate of mortality and severe disability in patients after stroke (series of strokes). The stroke-related neurodegeneration gives rise to numerous neurological disorders, including cognitive decline (vascular dementia), motor disability (paralysis), and others associated with a wide range of impairments. Massive neuronal death after stroke could be barely overcame only by pharmacological interventions, but requires also implementation of cell therapies for replacement strategies. Although the long history of stem cell research had provided conceptual advances and clinical relevance of cell-based therapy, it has been less understood the neurophysiological basis of such tremendous effects of stem cells on the post-stroke recovery of brain function. Because recovery of the brain is not a single process, it is essential to clearly define the precise timing required for maturing of neurophysiological activity, ranging from intrinsic excitability to network function, for the entirely different stem cell-derived phenotypes. Dissecting this will expand the knowledge about stem cell therapy to find how best to use multiple routes of the therapy (induced pluripotent or embryonic stem cells) for the stroke-related neurodegeneration. More work is needed on defining the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell neurogenesis to provide the field with a meaningful consideration of cell therapy in context of promoting 'self-repair' of the post-stroke brain by engaging endogenous brain recovery mechanisms to power self-renewal. The perspective remains in accelerating neurophysiological maturation of neuronal phenotypes in the post-ischemic tissue tailored to enhancing the functional influence and, thereby, maximizing beneficial effects. Understanding the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell grafts will foster cell therapy use to augment therapeutic interventions in stroke-related neurodegeneration and to improve ultimate outcome.",

      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

      "abstract": "The duration of the movement aftereffect (MAE) has sometimes been used to make inferences about the subject's state (for example, their level of arousal). Some studies are reviewed in which visual aftereffects (including the MAE) were measured in schizophrenia, with inconsistent results. Some relevant psychopharmacological and neurological evidence is considered. It is concluded that: (i) Differences in the clinical status of the schizophrenic subjects and whether they were receiving medication, but not the method used to measure aftereffects, may underlie the interstudy disagreements. (ii) The effect of schizophrenia is to increase MAE duration, and this is not due to some peripheral artefact. (iii) Longer MAEs in the illness could result from enhanced neurally signalled contrast and/or from the increased adaptability of cortical neurons.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathy may be difficult to distinguish from neuronopathy, on both motor and sensory sides. A number of disorders that present with characteristic electro-clinical features are readily recognized. Except for those, distinction of the lesions that concern the peripheral nerve cell or the axon may require support of clinical, electrophysiological and other ancillary tests. Distinction between motor neuropathy and neuronopathy can be based on the abnormalities of nerve conduction and on the signs that relate to the reinnervation process. Signs of terminal axonal reinnervation, such as motor axon reflex, may be observed in axonal neuronopathies, whereas only collateral reinnervation occurs in motor neuronopathies. Sensory axonopathies are usually characterized by clinical and electrophysiological findings that are axon length-dependent, by the course of the disorder that is most often chronic, and by possible reversibility. Sensory neuronopathies are usually subacute and induce clinical deficits that are more or less widespread to the whole body surface rather than distal. Follow-up studies disclose limited or absent recovery. A better knowledge of the structural differences of motor and sensory neurons and axons will improve our understanding and lead to the development of specific tests. Meanwhile, although some parameters and techniques should still be improved, electrophysiological and additional tests are useful to detect and to distinguish the peripheral nerve disorders that affect the nerve cell bodies and their axons.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The differential diagnosis of optic neuropathy is broad. Ischemic vascular forms of optic neuropathy are more common in older patients. Pain generally accompanies the visual loss in cases of inflammatory optic neuritis. Compressive or infiltrative lesions that affect the optic nerve, such as optic glioma or optic nerve sheath meningioma, may present with painless unilateral visual loss. Neoplastic and non-neoplastic causes of compression of the intracranial optic nerve and optic chiasm frequently present with visual field defects. Slowly progressive, symmetric, central visual loss suggests a possible toxic or nutritional cause. Hereditary optic neuropathies generally are classified by their mode of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or mitochondrial (maternal) inheritance. Symptoms may be confined to the visual system or be accompanied by other neurologic or systemic signs and symptoms. Optic neuropathy can also be a manifestation of inherited metabolic and degenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Neuroendocrine abnormalities in depression have been regarded, by many authors, as relatively specific markers of nosological subtypes of the disorder, e.g. primary vs. secondary, endogenous vs. non-endogenous or unipolar vs. bipolar depression. They should reflect the same changes in central neurotransmitters (e.g. noradrenergic insufficiency and/or cholinergic hyperactivity) that were hypothesized as the cause of clinical symptoms. This view is challenged on the basis of our own neuroendocrine investigations in 317 psychiatric patients and 103 normal controls. According to these studies the abnormalities are nosologically rather unspecific. They are induced by a large variety of factors, e.g. emotional stress associated with the clinical symptomatology, weight loss due to malnutrition as a consequence of reduced appetite, medication and drug withdrawal. Stress-induced hypercortisolism appears to be the most common abnormality that may trigger other neuroendocrine dysfunctions, such as a blunted TSH response to TRH. Differences in neuroendocrine abnormalities of depressives are probably due to variations in the manifold factors influencing the hormonal axes involved, to temporal changes in hormonal patterns (e.g. one abnormality triggering another) and to individual differences in the basic activity and the responsiveness of the various axes.",

This is partly because the nervous system is a communications system with direct access to consciousness, so that the patient is in a unique position to monitor his own disorder. Clinical diagnosis becomes very difficult in the presence of dysphasia, confusion or dementia. Another reason is that useful biochemical and histological information about the function of neurons is rarely available, in contrast to the wealth of data used in the assessment of diseases of other organs, such as the lungs, liver or kidneys. The failure of neurons in the CNS to regenerate means that delay in making a precise diagnosis can worsen the eventual outcome; the clinician often cannot afford to watch how an illness progresses before intervening.",

There are, however, some peculiarities that are typical of cardiac and skeletal muscle disorders. Skeletal muscle weakness presenting at any age may indicate a primary neuromuscular disorder (associated with creatine kinase elevation as in dystrophinopathies), a mitochondrial disease (particularly if encephalopathy, ocular myopathy, retinitis, neurosensorineural deafness, lactic acidosis are present), a storage disorder (progressive exercise intolerance, cognitive impairment and retinitis pigmentosa, as in Danon disease), or metabolic disorders (hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperammonaemia or other specific biochemical abnormalities). In such patients, skeletal muscle weakness usually precedes the cardiomyopathy and dominates the clinical picture. Nevertheless, skeletal involvement may be subtle, and the first clinical manifestation of a neuromuscular disorder may be the occurrence of heart failure, conduction disorders or ventricular arrhythmias due to cardiomyopathy. ECG and echocardiogram, and eventually, a more detailed cardiovascular evaluation may be required to identify early cardiac involvement. Paediatric and adult cardiologists should be proactive in screening for neuromuscular and related disorders to enable diagnosis in probands and evaluation of families with a focus on the identification of those at risk of cardiac arrhythmia and emboli who may require specific prophylactic treatments, for example, pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and anticoagulation.",

      "title": "The Problem of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Functional&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder is an entity that is commonly referred to by names such as psychogenic or conversion disorder [1]. It is defined as a neurological disorder caused by psychological factors, falling into the category of somatic symptom disorders in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Some well-known examples of somatic symptom disorders involving other organ systems include irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and chronic pelvic pain [2].\r\n\r\nPatients with functional disorders are seen in various clinical settings and are commonly admitted as an inpatient for further work-up and symptom management [3]. Those with neurological symptoms in particular may receive work-up beyond the scope of being thorough, as their symptoms can be concerning for neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. Physicians may ultimately become convinced that these patients’ symptoms are due to a psychological cause, but convincing these patients may not be easy, as the suffering is real but the treatment is not instantaneous.\r\n\r\nAs a movement disorders clinical fellow, I often see patients with functional movement disorders. Functional movement disorders can present in various ways such as tremor, myoclonus, or dystonia, but share common clinical features on examination such as variability, distractibility and entrainibility of the movements [4]. Although the term psychogenic is considered to be less ambiguous than functional, its negative nuance may add to the patients’ struggle to accept the diagnosis. Some common reactions are: “Are you saying it is all in my head?” “I find it hard to believe that what I am experiencing is just from stress.” “…but I don’t feel stressed.”\r\n\r\nThrough my fellowship, I have tried different ways of delivering the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder. My strategy has evolved with experience, a mix of successful and unsuccessful situations. For example, the patient might seem to be initially receptive of the diagnosis and considering the recommended treatment options with a positive attitude. When this appeared to be the case, I would feel not only relieved, but also a sense of triumph-I had successfully dealt with a challenging situation, and now surely the patient would be on the road to recovery! I quickly realized that this was not always the case. In the following days, I would receive emails doubting or misinterpreting the diagnosis that seemed to be clear at the time. Some patients seemed unhappy, if not angry or disappointed. I would often review the approach that I had used to deliver the diagnosis on the day of the visit, and try to revise my strategy accordingly, hoping to be more successful the next time.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons may underlie this difficulty of accepting the diagnosis of a functional disorder. Currently, the knowledge on the physiology of the disorder is limited, and we cannot satisfactorily explain to these patients exactly how this occurs, which may add to the patient’s skepticism towards the diagnosis. The variability of symptoms, a common feature of the disorder itself, may confuse and deceive the patients, leaving them to wonder what rare organic neurological disorder they might have as the cause. Last but not least, patients may be influenced by the stigma of having any disorder that has relation to psychological factors, and even misinterpret the diagnosis as malingering, an intentional production of symptoms.\r\n\r\nBut do we physicians also have difficulty embracing the diagnosis of a functional disorder? Some patients are seen by several physicians and undergo extensive testing until seen by someone who might finally share the diagnosis. It is not unusual that this can be years later since the beginning of symptoms. Delivering the diagnosis is certainly challenging for reasons mentioned above, and physicians fear missing an organic neurological disorder. However, simply labeling these patients as having ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ not only leads to increased healthcare cost [5], but can result in increased morbidity and mortality from unnecessary diagnostic workup or treatment.\r\n\r\n“How can you tell me it’s functional when I am not functional?” The words of a patient echo through my head as I share this diagnosis with yet another patient. I only hope to be able to help my patients so that they understand that the diagnosis was achieved through identifying positive signs and symptoms, and that it is not merely a diagnosis of exclusion. I try to reassure them that this disorder is very much real, involuntary and acknowledge that it can be very disabling. Some patients have accepted the diagnosis and made a substantial recovery through cognitive behavioral therapy. Hopefully, with more knowledge on the physiology, increased awareness of the disorder in both patients and the medical community and better strategies of sharing the diagnosis functional can one day become truly functional.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Unquestionably, the patient with low-back pain often is a diagnostic challenge for the physician irrespective of whether the physician is a neurologist, neurosurgeon, orthopedist, physiatrist, internist, or generalist. This is due, in part, to the fact that the patient’s complaint is a symptom, not a clinical sign or diagnosis, and the anatomical substrates for causing the problem are myriad (Fig. 16.1). The etiologies are diverse, if not legion, and there is poor correlation with symptoms, laboratory study findings, and pathological findings. This accounts for the fact that in 85% of patients with acute low-back pain and in 50% of patients with chronic low-back pain, no diagnosis is ever established.64,156,209 Further the problem may be complicated by other factors, resulting in an exaggeration of symptoms by nonphysiological processes (psychological, remunerative, occupational, etc.).",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint in the general population. The condition can manifest itself in several ways and can be triggered in different scenarios, facts that render it a peculiar and multifaceted clinical entity. Nosologically, insomnia can be understood as a symptom or as a disorder with its own characteristics and has a chronic course. Insomnia disorder is more common among women and older adults, as well as in social risk strata, and is usually associated with comorbidities, particularly mental disorders. The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder have changed as new perspectives emerge. The cause-based classification (e.g., secondary to clinical diseases; associated with poor sleep hygiene) was abandoned in the latest editions of clinical manuals, which combined the subdivisions into a single entity, insomnia disorder. There are varied pathophysiological mechanisms that involve physiological and psychological features. The chronification of insomnia is more easily understood based on psychosocial models, especially Spielman's model that explains the development and maintenance of insomnia based on predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. The most recent challenge is to determine new clinical phenotypes that allow a more assertive approach and treatment.",

It comprises a wide range of etiologies, including Creutzfledt-Jakob disease and Alzheimer's disease. When faced with a recent and rapid onset of major cognitive impairment, it is essential to rule out delirium or any other cause that may lead to rapid cognitive decline (such as stroke, encephalitis, or epileptic seizure). The work-up is based on a detailed history (drugs, exposure, medical history), a thorough clinical examination, and a broad biological work-up including MRI, lumbar puncture and EEG. Management should rapidly involve a neurologist or a specialized center.Les démences rapidement progressives se distinguent des autres troubles neurocognitifs par leur rapidité d’installation, soit moins de deux ans entre les premiers symptômes et le diagnostic.

The onset and severity of terminal decline vary greatly between individuals. It is thought that a certain degree of cognitive decline occurs due to biological changes in the aging human brain, but evidence suggests that more abrupt and perceptible decline is often associated with an underlying death process or disease pathology. Decline is often gradual and relatively imperceptible for a period of several years, then increases dramatically in closer proximity to death. Future investigations are necessary to characterize disease‐specific decline trajectories and understand how specific areas of cognition (i.e., memory, vocabulary) are affected by terminal decline.",

They can emerge due to genetic factors or abnormalities in the brain or body acquired after birth, or because of faulty or incomplete physical experiences when learning more complex behavior. Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

Causal pathologies are either cerebral or general. The most common is the stroke, especially if it is haemorrhagic. If the seizure is delayed in relation to stroke, it defines vascular epilepsy and is an indication for long-term antiepileptic therapy. Neurodegenerative diseases, primarily Alzheimer's disease, are associated with epilepsy, but the pathophysiological links between the two are poorly understood. The clinical presentation of seizures is often atypical and the existence of memory disorders complicates the diagnosis because they make it difficult to reconstruct the anamnesis. Cranial trauma and tumours are the other classic brain causes of epilepsy. The general causes include metabolic and hydroelectrolytic disorders (especially hypoglycaemia and hyponatremia), drugs (either by their toxicity or by a withdrawal syndrome), and uraemic encephalopathy of renal failure. Finally, alcohol is a common cause not to be neglected, including among institutionalised patients.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders and the epilepsies share common etiologies and pathologies. The severity of impairment and the variety of symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders or with particular epilepsy syndromes reflect focal or global, structural or functional dysfunction of neuronal networks. The complex relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy is secondary to common factors that include genetics, cognition, motor and language function. The epileptic encephalopathies are associated with regression or slowing of cognitive, language or behavior and the accepted working hypothesis is that this is a direct consequence of the seizures or of the interictal epileptiform activity, as opposed to the associated medical condition. The evidence that recurrent seizures or abnormal electrical activity can cause specific cognitive, language or behavioral abnormalities even in accepted epileptic encephalopathies is still controversial. Data from animal studies and the clinical experience from epileptic encephalopathies of early life imply that there are developmental time windows crucial to the type of epilepsy syndrome and to cognitive and behavioral outcome.The management of children in whom a neurodevelopmental disorder coexists with epilepsy is a difficult problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the epilepsy and the specific cognitive or behavioral problem and is tailored to the needs of the individual child.",

Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

      "abstract": "The development and selection of optimal outcome measures is increasingly recognized as a key component of evidence-based medicine, particularly the need for the development of a standardized set of measures for use in clinical trials. This process is particularly complex for functional neurological disorder (FND) for several reasons. FND can present with a wide range of symptoms that resemble the full spectrum of other neurological disorders. Additional physical (e.g., pain, fatigue) and psychological (e.g., depression, anxiety) symptoms are commonly associated with FND, which also can be highly disabling with implications for prognosis, and warrant concurrent assessment, despite an unclear etiological relationship with FND. Furthermore, several unique clinical aspects of FND make it likely that the usual prioritization of \"objective\" (or clinician-rated) over \"subjective\" (or patient-rated) measures might not be appropriate. Self-report measures may be more clinically meaningful in this patient population. Despite being a common and disabling disorder, there has been little research into outcome measures in FND, and to date trials have largely used measures designed for the assessment of other disorders. An international FND Core Outcome Measure group (FND-COM) has been established to develop a consensus battery of outcomes for FND: a \"core outcome set.\" In this perspective article, the authors reviewed the process of outcome measure development and selection before considering the specific features of FND affecting the development of a core outcome set, as well as a research agenda to optimize outcome measurement in this complex neuropsychiatric disorder.",

      "abstract": "The location of single strategic infarcts and the cognitive impairment after a stroke reect the neuroanatomy of the brain's cognitive functions. Poststroke dementia or post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSD/PSCI) is a form of cognitive disturbance caused by cerebrovascular disease that can manifest at different times after a stroke, including during the acute phase of stroke, during the recovery phase (while motor stroke symptoms improve), or months and years later. The onset of cognitive impairment depends on the location of infarct. Infarct in certain locations have cognitive impairment as a sole presentation from the outset. Infarcts in the left frontotemporal lobes, right parietal lobe, and left thalamus are notably correlated with cognitive impairment following a stroke. In the former, patients present with complains of motor difculties as the main complain. In addition to these locations, vascular lesions in the thalamo-perforating area of the PCAmay cause dementia and other forms of severe memory loss. Abaseline (pre-morbid) and early post-stroke (early post-morbid) cognitive status should be evaluated and a protocol for the same is needed in regular clinical and ICU care facilities. MoCA assessment is commonly used for cognitive assessment. Its role in strategic infarcts is undermined as it leaves out the evaluation of symptoms corresponding to common strategic infarct locations such as the medial temporal lobe and thalami. There is a need for dedicated neuropsychological assessment score based on education level, and native-language for PSCI.",

      "abstract": "Serious physical illness naturally leads to emotional disturbance, particularly when the illness is disabling or life-threatening, so it is not surprising that stroke is associated with mood disorder, manifested as an increase either in general levels of distress or in the rate of clinically diagnosable states. In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

The most difficult problems in differential diagnosis arise from psychoneurosis and gallbladder disease.

Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development.

At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development.

      "abstract": "Las distrofias musculares congénitas (DMC) son enfermedades musculares hereditarias muy heterogéneas. Su diagnóstico se basa en criterios histológicos (signos distróficos en músculo) y clínicos (de inicio neonatal o durante la infancia precoz, antes de adquirir la marcha). Los lactantes presentan hipotonía, movilidad disminuida y retraso o estancamiento del desarrollo motor. Son enfermedades progresivas, con frecuente aparición de retracciones articulares, rigidez y deformidad de columna, insuficiencia respiratoria y, en algunas formas, afectación cardiaca. Por ello, necesitan un manejo multidisciplinario neuro-ortopédico, cardio-respiratorio y frecuentemente quirúrgico. Los valores de las enzimas musculares (CK) permiten orientar el diagnóstico. Formas con aumento marcado de CK guían hacia la DMC con déficit de merosina (gen LAMA2) y las distroglicanopatías, muy heterogéneas genéticamente. Ambas pueden asociar anomalías cerebrales y retraso mental (frecuente en las distroglicanopatías), o limitarse a la sustancia blanca cerebral, sin deterioro cognitivo (merosinopatías). La biopsia muscular ayuda en el diagnóstico detectando el déficit de merosina o la glicosilación anómala de distroglicano. Las formas de DMC sin aumento importante de CK no presentan afectación cerebral y se diagnostican frecuentemente gracias a la identificación de signos clínicos como hiperlaxitud distal en la DMC de Ullrich (genes COL6), rigidez espinal selectiva y fallo respiratorio en las selenopatías (gen SEPN1) o “drop-head” en las laminopatías (gen LMNA). La resonancia magnética muscular es muy útil para confirmar la sospecha clínica y orientar casos difíciles. La identificación genética y el desarrollo de modelos animales están ayudando a conocer mejor la fisiopatología de estas enfermedades, aumentando las posibilidades de encontrar terapias para el futuro. Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) are inherited muscle disorders with a high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Diagnostic criteria are histological (dystrophy in muscle biopsy) and clinical (onset at birth or before the age of walking). Affected infants typically appear “floppy” with low muscle tone and poor spontaneous movements. Patients may present with delay or arrest of gross motor development. CMDs show progressive weakness, joint contractures, spinal stiffness and deformities, respiratory compromise and certain types may develop cardiac symptoms. Multidisciplinary management is required, including neuro-orthopedic, cardio-respiratory and often surgical treatment. Dosage of muscle enzymes (CK) helps in the diagnostic pathway. Marked increase is observed in merosin deficient CMD (LAMA2 gene) and in the dystroglycanopathies, which are genetically very heterogeneous. Both disorders may show central nervous system abnormalities, being often associated with mental retardation in dystroglycanopathies, while merosinopathies show only striking white matter changes and intellect is not impaired. Muscle biopsy helps to detect defects in merosin expression or abnormal dystroglycane glycosylation. CMDs without marked increase of CK do not associate brain involvement. Diagnosis is often oriented by the identification of clinical markers such as distal hyperlaxity in Ullrich CMD (COL6 genes), selective spinal rigidity and respiratory failure in selenopathies (SEPN1 gene), or dropped head in laminopathies (LMNA gene). Muscle MRI is very useful to confirm clinical suspicion and orientate difficult cases. Gene identification in these disorders and development of animal models are helping to better understand their physiopathologic mechanisms, opening the possibility for future therapies.",

      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The most common errors in the diagnosis of dementia are underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Underdiagnosis is best avoided by careful use of psychometric screening tests to detect cognitive impairment in patients unaware of their own defect. Overdiagnosis can be avoided by not applying the label of “dementia” until the diagnosis is unequivocal. Complete evaluation is necessary to rule out treatable causes of dementia, and should include medical, neurological, and psychiatric history and examination, simple psychometric tests, laboratory battery, computerized transaxial tomographic brain scan, and electroencephalogram. Ultimately, the diagnosis of dementia may change at follow‐up examination, and the unequivocal diagnosis of a specific form of dementia still requires autopsy and neuropathological examination of the brain. The most common causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly include Alzheimer's disease, multi‐infarct dementia, depression, and other specific illnesses such as tumors, Jakob‐Creutzfeldt disease, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Even systemic disease can present as dementia. The evaluation outlined above may help distinguish among these causes. New diagnostic techniques may eventually be helpful as well.",

      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

      "abstract": "У статті розглядається питання необхідності дослідження особистісної саморегуляції в дітей із порушеннями інтелектуального розвитку. Ситуація в країні сприяє збільшенню травматичних стресів, які можуть мати серйозні наслідки для дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Ці події порушують базове відчуття безпеки особистості дитини та можуть призвести до розвитку різних психічних проблем. Травматичний стрес може викликати травматичний стресовий синдром (ТСС) або посттравматичний стресовий розлад (ПТСР), які характеризуються різними симптомами, такими як повторні спогади про травматичну подію, проблеми зі сном, харчові розлади, депресія тощо. У дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку ці симптоми можуть бути особливо вираженими та можуть потребувати специфічної та індивідуалізованої підтримки. Крім того, травматичні стреси можуть сприяти розвитку інших невротичних і психічних розладів, таких як тривожність, депресія, різноманітні фобії тощо. Ці розлади можуть значно ускладнити життя дитини й вимагати комплексного підходу до їх корекції та підтримки. Однією з важливих характеристик особистості дитини з порушенням інтелектуального розвитку є незрілість її емоційної сфери. Тому важливо вчасно виявляти та вирішувати проблеми, пов’язані з травматичним стресом, у дітей з порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Саморегуляція вважається ключовою якістю особистості й важливим фактором гармонійних міжособистісних відносин у дітей із такими порушеннями як самих із собою, так і з оточуючим світом. Саморегуляція сприяє подоланню різноманітних перешкод, що заважають повноцінному включенню дитини в реальне життя, а також дозволяє розкрити її психологічний потенціал.",

      "abstract": "The assessment of patients with mental health problems is often seen as different from assessment in other areas of medicine. However, it has much in common with any area of medicine in which taking a good history is vital. It should be conducted in a systematic way using good interview techniques. Clear knowledge and understanding of the signs of mental illness is essential for accurate assessment. The assessment should allow the clinician to reach a differential diagnosis, and to estimate how much confidence can be placed in the primary diagnosis. Although there are few diagnostic tests in psychiatry, appropriate investigation of patients includes assessment of their physical health (and whether this might relate to their psychiatric presentation), formal and detailed assessment of their cognitive function (which can help characterize or localize possible brain pathology), objective ratings of the severity of symptoms, and neuro-imaging if indicated.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

      "title": "Delayed Neuronal Degeneration Results from Endogenous Glutamate Excess",
      "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes clinical neurological dysfunction that may be acute, fluctuating, or progressive.1,2 The molecular basis for neuronal injury has not been elucidated, although antineuronal antibodies have been identified in some patients. Immune-mediated injury to vessels or to coagulation cascades that cause inflammatory vasculopathies or embolic or hemorrhagic phenomena can produce ischemia and neuron death, as in stroke, seizures, and spinal cord and peripheral nervous system disease.3 Questions about the mechanism of chronic neurological disease in SLE, such as encephalopathy, and cognitive and behavioral disorders, arise when the autoantibody markers for active SLE fail to correlate with the neurological symptoms.1,4,5 (For an alternate opinion, see ref. 6.) Some will argue that this failure amounts to inadequate methodology either in detection of autoantibodies or in detection of a cytokine imbalance that mediates central nervous system injury independent of autoantibodies. Alternatively, chronic or progressive neurological symptoms in SLE may not depend on the activity of the systemic disease. For example, neurologic disease in SLE could depend on nonimmune-mediated factors like infection and toxic effects of medications. There is another possible mechanism that would account for the failure of chronic or progressive neurological disease to correlate with systemic disease. Recent experiments in several different animal models suggest that an initial insult to the brain may initiate a cascade of events that ultimately lead to distal progressive neuron loss. Based on these studies it is possible that an immune insult could initiate injury and become resolved, but the neuron injury could continue in an expanding cascade without the presence of serum markers of immunologic disease. Building on experimental evidence that had demonstrated that the increased excitatory effect of glutamate and calcium influx causes neuronal death, studies on different animal models suggest that after an initial injury, neurons distant from the region of the first injury may die as the excitatory and inhibitory tone changes on downstream glutamate neurons.7–15 One experimental model demonstrated that ischemic or neurotoxic damage to the striatum caused, days later, the degeneration of 50% of the GABA neurons in the substantia nigra,13–15 although the substantia nigra was not damaged by the initial striatal injury. Behavioral changes in the animals correlated with the development of delayed neuronal degeneration.16 One possible mechanism for the delayed degeneration of GABA neurons in the substantia nigra reticulata depended on glutamatergic overactivity. A brief review of the critical feature of the anatomy of the striatonigral system shows that the substantia nigra reticulata receives inhibitory afferents from the striatum (caudate-putamen and globus pallidus), and excitatory glutamatergic afferents from the subthalamic nucleus. In the next experiment, ablation of the subthalamic nucleus occurred prior to the striatal injury. The nigral GABA neurons were completely protected from the endogenous excitotoxicity.14 These results suggest a central role for alterations of glutamate activity in chronic progressive neurological disease and raise the question of whether SLE cytokines or antibodies may provoke similar delayed neuronal injury by altering glutamatergic activity. In this hypothesis SLE cytokines or antibodies might affect upstream neurons and initiate a cascade of events that would evolve over a longer time, and lead eventually to neuronal death through overexcitation; alternatively SLE cytokines or antibodies might acutely affect glutamate receptors. This hypothesis would be plausible if SLE determined brain injury-affected neurons with excitatory or inhibitory activity on glutamatergic neurons or if SLE cytokines or antibodies demonstrated an effect on glutamate receptors. In fact, it has been demonstrated in SLE that microinfarcts and larger vessel occlusions destroy cortical, striatal, or thalamic brain regions with afferents to downstream glutamatergic neurons. Also, in SLE, defective regulation and function of interleukin-4, -6, and -10 have been recorded,17,18 and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that interleukin-6 protects neurons against glutamate-induced death.19 Interleukin-1-receptor antagonist also protects against excitotoxin-induced neuron death in in vivo experiments.20 Furthermore, some studies have identified a lymphocytotoxic antibody that cross-reacts with brain tissue.21 The recent finding, however, of autoantibodies to the glutamate receptor in patients with encephalitis and paraneoplastic syndrome22,23 may set the stage for a discovery of an autoantibody in SLE to the glutamate receptor. These data suggest that the search for the pathogenesis of the chronic neurological symptoms in SLE should also include the possibility that delayed neuronal degeneration may occur after the initial injury and need not necessarily associate with active SLE. Delayed neuronal degeneration might help explain the progressive or fluctuating neurologic impairments in systemic lupus erythematosus.",

Ziel dieser Übersicht ist es, anhand einer systematischen Literaturrecherche eine Reihe von Hypothesen zu diskutieren, die dieses überzufällig häufige, gemeinsame Auftreten erklären sollen. Eine Anzahl von Untersuchungen weist auf biologische Gemeinsamkeiten zwischen Depression und Demenz hin, ohne dass diese in allen Studien untermauert werden können. Die Vorgeschichte einer Depression kann als distaler Risikofaktor für demenzielle Erkrankungen angesehen werden. Besonders nach Ausbruch demenzieller Erkrankungen sind depressive Störungen häufig und der Zusammenhang zwischen beiden wahrscheinlich am stärksten. Bei Patienten mit großer kognitiver Reserve kann eine Depression als Reaktion auf die Wahrnehmung der beginnenden kognitiven Defizite gedeutet werden. Sicherlich können Depressionen bei der Alzheimer-Demenz und anderen Demenzformen als eigene Krankheitsentität angesehen werden, zumal sich die klinischen Syndrome von denen anderer Depressionen in früheren Lebensabschnitten etwas unterscheiden. Studien über die Therapie von Depressionen bei Demenzen haben in den letzten Jahren ein steigendes Interesse gefunden.

      "title": "Problemi di diagnostica differenziale nelle sindromi lombosciatalgiche",
      "abstract": "Gli Autori, in base alla loro esperienza pluriennale nella terapia delle sindromi lombo-sciatalgiche, distinguono tre gruppi principali di patologie: 1) Patologia delle radici o del nervo intervertebrale: Queste lesioni alte sono il regno della Neuroradiologia e raramente il paziente giunge al tavolo operatorio con una diagnosi dubbia. Le cause più frequenti di lesione a questo livello sono rappresentate dall'ernia discale, dalla stenosi del canale midollare (congenita o acquisita) e dalla stenosi del canale intervertebrale (continua o intermittente). Queste tre cause principali possono presentarsi isolate o variamente associate tra loro. 2) Patologia del plesso lombare o sacrale, patologia del tronco nervoso del nervo femorale o del nervo ischiatico: Le lesioni del plesso o del tronco nervoso rappresentano il regno della «elettro-diagnosi». Essa permette, infatti, la localizzazione del livello di lesione, agevolando quindi il ricorso ad altre indagini diagnostiche per individuare la causa. 3) Sindromi pseudo-sciatalgiche: Le sindromi pseudo-sciatalgiche rappresentano un gruppo di patologie caratterizzate da una sintomatologia algica lungo un'arto inferiore, in assenza di coinvolgimento diretto del nervo femorale o del nervo ischiatico. Esse possono riconoscere due meccanismi principali: a) Sindromi dolorose con meccanismo rifiesso: In questo gruppo di sindromi, la struttura sede di processo algico-infiammatorio è localizzata a livello lombare, ma essendo innervata da un ramo del plesso lombare o sacrale, il dolore viene falsamente avvertito nelle aree cutanee dal nervo femorale o ischiatico. Ciò si spiega col «fenomeno della convergenza». I principali quadri clinici sono rappresentati da: — Patologia delle articolazioni interapofisarie posteriori. Il meccanismo patogenetico dell'infiammazione articolare non è del tutto noto e probabilmente è complesso. — Patologia del legamento ileo-lombare. Tra le «legamentiti vertebrali» la patologia del legamento ileolombare su base meccano-degenerativa è certamente una delle forme più frequenti. — Patologia della articolazione coxo-femorale. L'articolazione coxo-femorale, per le sue caratteristiche di articolazione portante, è frequentemente coinvolta da patologie degenerative o infiammatorie. A causa della complessità della innervazione di tale articolazione, le zone di irradiazione del dolore possono essere molto varie. b) Sindromi dolorose da convolgimento delle strutture tendinee o fasciali dell'arto inferiore: In questo gruppo di sindromi il dolore lungo l'arto inferiore non è causato da una irradiazione, ma da un coinvolgimento patologico diretto di strutture muscolari, tendinee o fasciali dell'arto. In questo gruppo si possono includere le seguenti forme: — Sindrome fibro-mialgica primaria generalizzata. E caratterizzata da una dolorabilita alla presso-pal-pazione della cute, delle masse muscolari, delle inserzioni tendinee, da una sindrome ansiosa, da disturbi del sonno e della sfera affettiva e sessuale. — Patologia tendinea multidistrettuale dell'arto inferiore. — Patologia della fascia lata e della banderella ileo-tibiale",

Late-life depression (LLD) is an umbrella term to define depressed mood in people older than 65 years. It can have a variety of presentations: as recurrent disease stemming from earlier life (early onset depression [EOD]); as new-onset depression (late-onset depression [LOD]); as a mood disorder secondary to a general medical condition; or as mood symptoms secondary to substance or medication use [2]. Mistakenly, LLD is believed as a normal part of aging. For older people, depression could be the epiphenomenon of underlying biological processes (vascular changes, metabolic disturbances and neurodegenerative diseases); conversely, it could be the leading cause of cognitive impairment [3].",

Behandeling met klassieke antipsychotica verbetert de geheugenstoornissen niet of weinig; er zou zelfs sprake zijn van een nadelig effect op de geheugenfuncties.

Examination limitations, complex comorbidities, and technical difficulties associated with electrodiagnostic testing in an ICU setting also create unique challenges during evaluation of patients with possible neuromuscular disorders. Respiratory failure may occur as an initial sign of an underlying neuromuscular disorder, as a chronic respiratory insufficiency, or as an inability to wean the patient from mechanical ventilation. Respiratory function is often closely related to dysphagia, which may also lead to aspiration and sudden worsening of respiratory function. In addition to weakness, progressive cardiomyopathy associated with myopathies can precipitate cardiac failure and arrhythmias and even necessitate heart transplantation.

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have \"soft\" signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

In systemic and metabolic disorders, EEG changes reflect the diffuse cerebral impairment and may detect negative prognostic factors. Widespread EEG slowing sometimes associated with epileptiform activity is a typical pattern encountered in these conditions; however it is neither pathognomonic nor specific of a certain etiology.

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

      "abstract": "The origin of degenerative diseases of the central nervous system lies in genetic and acquired disorders. Analysis of the clinical characteristics of diseases affecting specific neuronal systems may help us to understand their pathogenesis. The stereotyped symptomatology characteristic of most degenerative diseases results from neuronal death in specific pathways: pyramidal tract and motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, nigrostriatal dopamine system in Parkinson's disease, posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord in Friedreich's ataxia, etc. This suggests that these neurons are sensitive to pathological processes that are still unknown. Progression of the disease, whether linear or not, is slow, but it is more rapid than similar effects due to ageing. This indicates either that the environmental cause of degeneration (if it exists) is continuously present or that a vital process has been once and for all disrupted, perhaps at the level of the genome, causing insufficient production of essential proteins, or accumulation of eventually toxic metabolites. Symptoms generally appear during adulthood, i.e. after normal differentiation has taken place, and after a considerable number of neurons have already been damaged. The initiation of neuronal death precedes the appearance of the first symptoms.",

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "The prognosis for those suffering from frequent seizures will be closely linked to their etiology (1). If there is extensive brain damage, whether this results from trauma, disease, or brain tumors, there is likely to be a poor response to whatever treatment is given. The more diffuse the lesions the worse this will be: and localisation is also a factor, for example mesial temporal sclerosis causing complex partial seizures. For these reasons patients who are mentally handicapped often have the additional handicap of epilepsy (2). The best chance of controlling the fits lies in making an accurate diagnosis and applying appropriate treatment, whether this is surgery to remove a tumor or the identification of a metabolic disorder which can be controlled, such as pyridoxine dependency or biotinidase deficiency (3). It is important to identify epileptic syndromes, often genetically determined, so that at least an accurate prognosis can be given, even if this does not effect treatment. For example the prognosis for infantile spasms and the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are well known (4). Tuberous sclerosis is another diagnosis to be viewed with concern. Even within the field of epilepsy there are important diagnostic issues; for instance differentiating minor seizures from reflex anoxic seizures, and absence epilepsy and pseudoseizures from complex partial seizures (5).

      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC.

      "abstract": "CONTEXTO: A realização de diagnóstico neurológico e psiquiátrico em ambiente de emergência hospitalar com freqüência é uma tarefa complexa e exige colaboração interdisciplinar. Um dos diagnósticos diferenciais de doenças neurológicas é o transtorno conversivo, cuja característica principal é a presença de sintomas afetando funções motoras ou sensoriais, que sugerem desordem clínica ou neurológica, porém sem doença orgânica subjacente que explique o quadro. RELATO DE CASO: Os autores relatam o caso de uma paciente de 23 anos com apresentação clínica atípica de acidente vascular cerebral, afasia global sem hemiparesia, que foi inicialmente diagnosticada como transtorno psiquiátrico pelo serviço de clínica médica de emergência. CONCLUSÃO: Certas apresentações neurológicas podem ser interpretadas como transtorno conversivo pelas similaridades clínicas entre as duas desordens, raridade do quadro clínico, pela presença de sintomatologia psiquiátrica e fatores psicossociais nos pacientes neurológicos. Mesmo com apresentações neurológicas atípicas e sintomas psiquiátricos, pacientes com quadro sugestivo de transtorno conversivo devem ser sempre investigados de forma interdisciplinar.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders (PDs) in neurology are more frequent then it verified in routine exam, not only in the less developed but also in large and very developed neurological departments. Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

It is emphasized that psychopathological syndromes are not pathognomony for certain neurological diseases. Among the signs that help in the correct diagnosis of mental disorders caused by neurological pathology, their sudden occurrence on heteronomy soil with very variable and atypical for mental diseases of clinical manifestations, the absence of aggravated by mental illness (including family) history, resistance to the drugs commonly used in psychiatric pathology, the patient’s intake of drugs, among side effects which are mental disorders. In the diagnosis, the key is the correct assessment of neurological status, its dynamics, as well as confirmed by paraclinical research methods, in patients with neurological diseases, which in themselves can lead to the development of mental disorders. However, ignoring the features of mental disorders, the lack of a clinically adjusted approach to this category of patients, difficulties in highlighting the most significant symptoms, can lead to misdiagnosis. Therefore, it is so important to know not only the neurological manifestations of certain neurological diseases, but also to properly navigate their mental manifestations. To solve this problem, it is necessary to closely interact psychiatrists with neurologists. Only with this condition will it be possible to effectively help the patient.",

Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described.

Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

      "title": "Aspectos psicológicos y neuropsicológicos de la esclerosis múltiple",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION\nLa Esclerosis Multiple (EM) es una enfermedad de naturaleza desmielinizante y curso cronico, cuya base anatomopatologica se caracteriza por un proceso de destruccion de las vainas de mielina que recubren los axones neuronales (manifestandose en forma de lesiones distribuidas extensamente en el parenquima cerebral y la medula espinal), lo que propiciaria una alteracion en los mecanismos sinapticos y la emergencia de los sintomas caracteristicos de la misma. Se trata de una neuropatologia que se diagnostica habitualmente al final de la segunda decada de la vida o inicio de la tercera, con una prevalencia superior entre las mujeres (2:1). Supone, ademas, una de las principales causas de discapacidad en este periodo etario. \nA nivel sintomatologico se aprecia una clinica diversa en la que predomina el compromiso sensomotriz, acompanado con cierta frecuencia de perdidas en otras areas de relevancia clinica y humana (vision, funcion vesical/intestinal, estabilidad postural, fatiga o dolor; entre otros). La evolucion es generalmente en forma de brotes periodicos (85%), seguidos de un periodo de remision/estabilidad tras el cual pueden prevalecer sintomas residuales (cuyo efecto acumulativo genera discapacidad con el devenir del tiempo). Ocasionalmente este proceso se presenta de modo continuo, tanto desde el inicio de la enfermedad (EM primaria progresiva) como tras algunos anos de convivencia con el subtipo bifasico (EM secundaria progresiva), momento en el que la EM constituye un reto terapeutico todavia mayor. \nLa literatura sobre esta patologia evidencia la presencia de resonancias en el area de la salud mental de estos pacientes (presencia de sintomas depresivos, deterioro de la calidad de vida, compromiso de la funcion cognitiva, etc.), que requieren la puesta en marcha de recursos diagnosticos y terapeuticos especificos dirigidos a su deteccion y abordaje clinico.\n OBJETIVO\nLa presente tesis doctoral tiene como proposito principal evaluar a un grupo de pacientes con diagnostico de EM en una serie de variables sociodemograficas, clinicas, psicologicas y neuropsicologicas; con el fin de explorar las relaciones que se establecen entre todas ellas y detectar las necesidades asistenciales de este colectivo en el ambito de la salud mental.\n METODO\nSe opto por un diseno descriptivo y transversal, de corte correlacional. Se incluyo un grupo control (personas sin evidencia de la enfermedad), de tamano equivalente al clinico (n=55 en ambos casos). Tras una profunda revision de la literatura, se procedio a la construccion de una bateria de evaluacion dirigida a la exploracion de las siguientes variables: estres (Escala de Sucesos Vitales Estresantes -SVEAD), afrontamiento (Cuestionario de Estilos de Afrontamiento -COPE), apoyo social (Cuestionario Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey -MOS-SSS), personalidad (Cuestionario de Personalidad de Eysenck Revisado -EPQ-R), sintomas psicologicos (Cuestionario Revisado de Sintomas Psicologicos -SCL-90-R), calidad de vida (Cuestionario Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 -MSQOL-54), dolor (West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory -WHYMPI) y funcion cognitiva (Bateria Neuropsicologica Breve -BNB y Trail Making Test -TMT). Para la evaluacion de las variables sociodemograficas se diseno una entrevista ad hoc.\nEl analisis de los datos contemplo estrategias de comparacion de medias, analisis multivariados (discriminante), analisis correlacionales y analisis de mediacion; ademas del calculo de los correspondientes tamanos del efecto. Adicionalmente, se exploro la consistencia interna de todos los factores sometidos a estudio.\n RESULTADOS\nDe las diferencias obtenidas entre los pacientes y la poblacion general (de las que se infieren las necesidades asistenciales) se concluye: un malestar emocional mas intenso, una erosion pronunciada de la calidad de vida, un apoyo social deficitario, un perfil de personalidad que implica vulnerabilidad para la psicopatologia, un estres acentuado y un uso mas frecuente del afrontamiento emocional. Paralelamente, el analisis discriminante extrae las dimensiones que permiten una mejor diferenciacion entre los grupos, asi como su correspondiente capacidad de clasificacion.\nSe confirma, asimismo, el papel modulador de determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas (discapacidad, estres percibido, experiencia de un brote reciente y problemas para dormir) sobre un amplio abanico de dimensiones psicologicas y neuropsicologicas, evidenciandose la configuracion de patrones especificos de expresion en casa caso. Tambien se corrobora el papel mediador del apoyo social en la relacion que se establece entre la discapacidad y el malestar emocional, asi como la capacidad de mediacion del afrontamiento orientado a la emocion y el neuroticismo en la asociacion entre el estres y las variables de resultado (sintomas psicologicos y calidad de vida). Por ultimo, se detallan las interacciones entre las variables contempladas en el estudio, de modo que puedan discernirse las relaciones de covariacion que se establecen entre todas ellas en aras de una comprension mas profunda de la experiencia interna del paciente.\n CONCLUSION\nLa EM es una enfermedad compleja, que presenta un evidente impacto sobre la salud mental de la persona que la sufre. La presente tesis doctoral extrae algunas de las principales necesidades asistenciales (incluyendo el modo en que determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas durante el proceso de enfermedad pueden modular la experiencia subjetiva del paciente) y explora las interacciones entre variables de relevancia clinica (incluyendose las relaciones con el deterioro cognitivo), de modo que pueda incrementarse el conocimiento disponible sobre la enfermedad desde la perspectiva de la salud mental. Los analisis de mediacion determinan que tanto el apoyo social como el estilo de afrontamiento emocional (dos dimensiones susceptibles de abordaje terapeutico) tienen un importante papel explicativo en la relacion que se objetiva entre la discapacidad y el estres con la sintomatologia psicologica y la calidad de vida. \nLos resultados obtenidos permiten incrementar el conocimiento actual sobre los aspectos psicologicos y neuropsicologicos de la EM, y ofrecer herramientas para el diseno de un plan de tratamiento orientado a este colectivo.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

      "title": "Abdominal Pain: Is It in the Gut Or in the Head?",
      "abstract": "It is in both. Many years have gone by since physicians used the naive dichotomy of mind versus body to differentiate \"real\" from \"imaginary\" diseases. Of course, the \"real\" ones were those that the physician could touch, see, photograph, or analyze under the microscope and the \"ones in your mind\" were those associated with disorders of function or with emotional distress. The implication was that the conditions the physician could not see were either feigned or not as important. Now we know that the gastrointestinal tract functions as a sensory and motor organ and that in each individual brain and gut have a constant exchange of information. Rare are the conditions that affect solely one domain and not the other. Even conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, in which the presence of bleeding and inflammatory changes provide legitimacy of real disease, are associated with high levels of mental disorders and treatment of the psychologic co-morbidities is often associated with significant improvement in quality of life (1). In other conditions, classically considered purely psychiatric, such as depression, there is a high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and evidence of abnormal gastrointestinal function (2). The recent observation that some functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) may be associated with subtle inflammatory changes (3) is blurring even further the distinction between organic diseases and functional disorders. An example of the complex interaction between mind and the gastrointestinal tract is the observation that patients who develop an intercurrent bacterial colitis are more likely to develop irritable bowel syndrome if the infection occurs at a time when there are more stressful events in the individual's life (4). Also, animal models of neonatal maternal separation (a stressful event perceived by the mind) have suggested that physical or emotional distress early in life may prime the gastrointestinal tract to develop visceral hyperalgesia (a gut dysfunction often found in FGID) (5). An observational study in Sweden has even suggested that gastric intubation in healthy newborns may be associated with late development of FGID (6). There is increasing evidence that corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) modifies gastrointestinal function and new therapeutic strategies for FGID are beginning to target its function (7). In the context of such observations, the classic diatribe between diseases primarily coming from the head or from the gut seems futile and obsolete. Unfortunately, the bias against symptoms associated with disorders of function and with psychologic distress is still present in many health care providers (8) and patients and sabotages the development of ideal treatment strategies. There continues to be a hierarchy of stigma with health care providers and patients often feeling more comfortable dealing with organic diseases that with functional disorders and even less at ease with psychiatric illnesses. The Table summarizes some of the abnormalities in gut and brain function described in children with FGID.TABLE 1: Abnormalities in gut and brain function described in children with FGIDMost of the gastrointestinal dysfunctions refer to the areas of motility and sensation. Heterogeneous abnormalities in antroduodenal motility have been described in small groups of children with severe abdominal pain. More recently doubts have arisen about the etiologic role of motility in causing symptoms in FGID. There is often little correlation between abnormal contraction patterns and symptoms. It is now believed that patients with FGID are more likely to manifest an abnormal response to a physiological stimulus, such ingestion of food or release of gastrointestinal hormones, rather than have baseline dysmotility. Perturbance of gut motor reflexes may contribute to abnormal transit and onset of symptoms. Hypersensitivity has been demonstrated in all areas of the gut in response to balloon or gas distension in adults with a variety of FGID. It has recently been shown by using PET and functional MRI technology that adults with irritable bowel syndrome show an aberrant brain activation pattern both during noxious rectal distension and during the anticipation of rectal pain (28). Psychological factors, such as degree of parental anxiety, may be important in determining how a child and his caretakers react to a symptom and in health care seeking behavior. THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS In view of the interaction between gut and psychologic factors in generating symptoms in FGID it is clear that one cannot strive to cure the patient or treat the illness, until it becomes clear that there is only one health; the individual's health. Despite the fact that for years FGID were synonymous with \"motility disorders\", drugs that have targeted gut motility, such as antispasmodics or prokinetics have traditionally provided disappointing results (29). Treatment might be most effective if all aspects of the physiology of pain are addressed at once, within a bio-psycho-social model of care (30). Such an approach aims at treating peripheral and central neurologic sources of pain, as well as promoting behavioral changes for better coping with pain. Establishing a \"strong\" patient-physician alliance may be as effective as any other pharmacological or behavioral intervention to improve the patient's symptoms. Serotonin is found both in the enteric and the central nervous system and has recently emerged as a key mediator in modulating visceral sensitivity and motility. Interestingly, it has been reported that some of the medications who bind to serotonin receptors may exert their effects by modulating both gut and brain function (31). Low doses anti-depressant drugs, which inhibit serotonin uptake, facilitate endogenous endorphin release and have action the descending inhibitory pain control system, may benefit children with pain predominant FGIDs (32). Biofeedback, hypnosis, and other cognitive behavioral treatments have been beneficial in many conditions associated with chronic pain, including childhood FGIDs. \"Alternative\" treatments focusing on the \"MindBodySpirit\" connection have also great potential to impact functional disorders by modulating belief system and behaviors (33).",

      "abstract": "Virtually all drug interventions that have been successful pre-clinically in experimental stroke have failed to prove their efficacy in a clinical setting. This could be partly explained by the complexity and heterogeneity of human diseases as well as the associated co-morbidities which may render neuroprotective drugs less efficacious in clinical practice. One aspect of crucial importance in the physiopathology of stroke which is not completely understood is neuroinflammation. At the present time, it is becoming evident that subtle, but continuous neuroinflammation can provide the ground for disorders such as cerebral small vessel disease. Moreover, advanced aging and a number of highly prevalent risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis could act as silent contributors promoting a chronic proinflammatory state. This could aggravate the outcome of various pathological entities and can contribute to a number of subsequent post-stroke complications such as dementia, depression and neurodegeneration creating a pathological vicious cycle. Moreover, recent data suggests that the inflammatory process might be closely linked with multiple neurodegenerative pathways related to depression. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines could play a central role in the pathophysiology of both depression and dementia.",

No es tampoco un fenomeno unitario ya que engloba diferentes manifestaciones de dificultades lectoras asociadas a distintas disfunciones neuropsicologicas. Entre las hipotesis que se barajan en la literatura cientifica, las mas populares hacen referencia a la existencia de un deficit en el procesamiento fonologico o conciencia fonologica que consiste en una incapacidad para segmentar el flujo del habla en sus constituyentes sonoros. Todavia no se conoce con exactitud el origen de este problema aunque se han planteado dos hipotesis:\nA,- El deficit es producido por una disfuncion en un sistema especifico para el habla.\nB,- El deficit es producido por una deficiencia auditiva mas general caracterizada por una dificultad para discriminar estimulos que cambian rapidamente de frecuencias.\nEsta ultima hipotesis ha sido denominada hipotesis del procesamiento temporal.\nOtro tipo de teorias hacen referencia a la existencia de dificultades en el procesamiento visual tanto a un nivel de procesos basicos, que se encuentran relacionados con la via magnocelular encargada de procesar las imagenes en movimiento durante la lectura, como de procesos superiores asociados al procesamiento ortografico o visuoespecial.

Many alternative causes of encephalitis can be excluded after a careful clinical history and evaluation of the CSF, brain MRI, and routine blood tests. Some types of encephalitis can be suspected before receiving the results of neural antibodies, according to the clinical presentation (for instance, faciobrachial dystonic seizures in anti-LGI encephalitis, or psychotic manifestation in anti-NMDAR encephalitis) or brain MRI features (temporal lobe involvement in limbic encephalitis).

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is underdiagnosed and, in consequence, not properly treated. Neuropathic pain is defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system. The term dysfunction is not clearly defined and is suggested not used. The prevalence of neuropathic pain is unknown, but a few detailed studies show that neuropathic pain is more common than previously assumed. Some common causes of neuropathic pain are entrapment/injuries to peripheral nerves, painful neuropathies, infections in the nervous system (i.e. postherpetic neuralgia), spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis and cerebral infarcts. Evaluation of neuropathic pain is performed on the basis of a thorough clinical examination which includes detailed questioning of different types of pain. Both spontaneous (ongoing and paroxysmal) as well as evoked pain may occur. The ongoing pain may be described by a large number of adjectives such as burning, aching, throbbing, sore, cutting, but there is no pain descriptor which is diagnostic for neuropathic pain. Pain may usually be evoked by lightly touching the skin or by exposure to cold. A clinical neurological examination is necessary in the evaluation of the level of injury, possibly also electromyography/neurography in case of peripheral nerve lesions or CT/MR in case of central lesions. Neuropathic pain is almost always characterised by changes in sensibility, usually involving the thin-fibre system (peripheral nerve fibres or central projections). Special emphasis is put on the examination of sensory dysfunction.",

KUNNSKAPSGRUNNLAG KUNNSKAPSGRUNNLAG En vurdering av eksisterende litteratur, inkludert litteratursøk, samt vår kliniske erfaring ligger til grunn for innholdet i artikkelen. RESULTATER RESULTATER I eksisterende undersøkelser er det brukt varierende definisjoner av tilstanden og det er anvendt ulike kartleggingsverktøy. Forekomsten av utmattelse etter hjerneslag eller traumatisk hjerneskade er usikker på grunn av ulike inklusjonskriterier og kartleggingsmetoder og fordi ulikt måletidspunkt kan gi ulike prevalenstall. I flere arbeider anslås forekomsten til å ligge mellom 50 % og 70 %. Vår kunnskap om de patologiske mekanismene er svært begrenset. Både premorbide, sosiodemografiske, slag-/traumerelaterte og komorbide faktorer spiller inn på hvordan pasienten oppfatter tilstanden. Blant anvendte behandlingstiltak er psykoedukasjon, aktivitetsregulering, fysisk trening og behandling av komorbide tilstander. Det er også gjort forsøk med medikamentell behandling, foreløpig uten overbevisende resultater. FORTOLKNING FORTOLKNING Utmattelse er vanlig hos hjerneslagpasienter og pasienter med traumatiske hjerneskader og begrenser ofte i betydelig grad deres hverdag.

      "abstract": "Abstract This article provides an overview of the neurological examination and diagnostic studies commonly used in the evaluation of low back pain, information that is essential for both clinical assessment and impairment rating in the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment . Clinical evaluation begins with a careful review of medical records. After taking a thorough history, the physician performs the physical examination, including neurological testing, on the patient. The clinical evaluation also determines data needed for impairment evaluation. Neurological examination helps distinguish among the various types of pathology suggested by the history, but to some extent the neurological examination lacks sensitivity and specificity and only about two-thirds (69%) of patients with documented L4-L5 or L5-S1 disc herniations demonstrated weakness or deep tendon reflex changes. To maximize information from the evaluation, physicians routinely test for nonorganic physical signs. Isolated positive signs have no clinical or predictive value, and only a score of three or more positive signs is considered clinically significant. Further, these tests were not designed to detect malingering. Used in isolation, the history, neurological examination, and various diagnostic studies do not have the necessary sensitivity and specificity to diagnose and identify the structural pathology responsible for lumbar radiculopathy. Integrating these components into a logical, unbiased evaluation, physicians usually can perform an accurate assessment.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

      "title": "Blurred boundaries of the brain-1 (Aide-memoire for patient narrative)",
      "abstract": "Background: This is a case series of clinical cases presenting to our Neuropsychiatry Center, who were either referred by physicians or approached to seek treatment on their own. They were receiving treatment since few years. No improvement in symptom were primary reason for referral and consultation with our team. Re-evaluation in realms of Neurology and Psychiatry depicted the missed link in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches exercised previously. The intent to reflect upon novel findings is not to undermine the effort applied in clinical evaluation by prior physicians, but to reflect few observations which may have been inadvertently missed during routine assessment. This serves as as an aide-memoire to history taking and suggestions to remain well informed and updated in our approach to service seekers. Abstract: Symptom overlap and comorbidities are commonly encountered in clinical practice of Psychiatry or Neurology. Many neurologic disorders have psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression in patients following a stroke or with multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease), and many psychiatric disorders have been associated with neurologic symptoms (e.g., movement disorders in schizophrenia). This overlap occurs mostly because brain is the source common for both neurological and psychiatric illness and on multiple occasion it becomes difficult to delineate the boundary, leading to diagnostic dilemmas, followed by inappropriate management strategies. Patients and family members suffer for long periods of time in trying to understand the disease phenomenon and prognosis. In this case series, we present 3 cases of clinical interest across different framework of clinical presentation and assessment for e.g, neurological illness being managed as psychiatric illness or scenarios where both neurological and psychiatric illness coexisted but only one aspect was addressed. Re-assessment and work up by a team of neurologists and psychiatrist lead to clarification of the boundaries (at least in these cases who underwent prolonged sufferings owing to lack in clarity of pathology) with precise diagnosis generating improved outcomes in functionality and satisfaction. The diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders is performed by psychiatrists through diagnostic interviews, and categorization of patients based on diagnostic and classification manual (ICD-10, DSM-5) which are syndrome/symptom based. Although this has been a standard practice, often error may occur in diagnosing illnesses falling under the wider realm of neurology and psychiatry. Some presenting symptoms may be assumed being part of neurological illness or of functional origin, or mixed states and many may be overlooked during routine clinical assessment.",

Some of the more noteworthy causes are related to medication, alcohol, aging, depression, and, as in this case study, the possible consequences of recurrent severe hypoglycemia related to diabetes.1 Diabetes, of course, may cause an increase in cognitive decline over the course of time because of vascular risk factors.2 Some evidence suggests that acute hyperglycemia may have a negative impact on cognitive performance.3\n\nDepression is the most common of the reversible causes of memory impairment, and people with diabetes are twice as likely to suffer from depression as those without diabetes.4 Recent evidence suggests that diabetes may create alterations in regions of the brain that are associated with affect regulation and increase the risk for developing a depressive disorder.5 Fortunately, problematic medications can be modified, and alcohol misuse or depression can be treated. Unfortunately, despite its relevance to the course of diabetes, depression is recognized and treated in fewer than one-third of people with diabetes.4\n\nThe relationship between recurrent severe hypoglycemia and cognitive impairment remains unclear. Both prospective and longitudinal studies of cognitive function have been so plagued by methodological problems that it is difficult to unequivocally determine whether patients who experience repeated episodes …",

As the experts 7 certified specialists (psychiatrists, psychologists and others) were involved. In the research the academically definitions and the clinical case descriptions of the following clinical phenomena were estimated: Conversion, obsession, neurasthenia, phobia, derealisation/depersonalization, anxiety (partly specific for neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders); True hallucinations, confusion, amnesia, fixation hypomnesia, anecphoria (partly specific for organic mental disorders); Pseudo hallucinations, delusion of control, automatism, paralogia, emotional withdrawal, autism, ambivalence (common symptoms of schizophrenia); Inability to feel, sadness, lassitude, euphoria, excitement as the signs of endogenous affective disorders. Mainly non-specific phenomenon - persecutory delusions. Thus were obtained 14 estimates for each item on a 100-point scale. Dispersion of majority ranges was too high to get significant differences. But 6 from 7 experts significantly (p<0.05) and 1 tendentionally (p<0.01) rated 3 symptoms (autism, conversion and paralogia) as relatively more complex as compared with 7 more simplex phenomena (anxiety, confusion, euphoria, excitement, neurasthenia, phobia and sadness) by U-Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney criteria. established ranges of psychopathological phenomena's complexity reveal non-linear relations to etiology but in some cases they can be useful instrument of differential diagnostics of mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Multiple Sklerose (MS) ist die häufigste degenerative Erkrankung des zentralen Nervensystems bei jungen Erwachsenen in den Industrienationen, einhergehend mit chronischen Entzündungen in Gehirn und Rückenmark und sukzessiver Demyelinisierung bzw. Zerstörung von Axonen. MS wird den Autoimmunerkrankungen zugeordnet, mit chronischem und meist schubförmigem Verlauf. Im Schub treten Ausfallerscheinungen wie Lähmungen, Erblinden oder kognitive Beeinträchtigungen auf. Die Ursachen sind ungeklärt. Zur pharmakologischen Therapie stehen u. a. Glukokortikoide und immunmodulierende Therapeutika zur Verfügung. Viele der körperlichen und psychosozialen Beeinträchtigungen wie Kau- und Schluckstörungen wirken sich direkt auf den Ernährungsstatus aus. Zusätzliche Beschwerden entstehen infolge unerwünschter Arzneimittelwirkungen, z. B. durch Glukokortikoide. Lähmung und psychosoziale Belastung tragen zur Adipositasentstehung bei. Im Resultat ist je nach Verlauf, das Risiko für Fehl-, Über- und/oder Unterernährung gegeben. Befragungen zeigten, dass ein hoher Anteil Betroffener unkontrolliert Nahrungssupplemente einnimmt bzw. einseitige Wunderdiäten durchführt, wodurch sich diese Risiken umso gravierender darstellen. Alle angeführten Punkte illustrieren den dringenden (Be-)Handlungsbedarf seitens Ernährungsmedizin und Ernährungsberatung, deren Vorteile unbestritten sind. Eine professionelle Anleitung kann der risikoreichen Eigenbehandlung entgegensteuern, bzw. zu Eigenständigkeit und Lebensqualität von MS-Kranken beitragen. Aktuell nehmen diese noch selten ernährungstherapeutische Beratung in Anspruch. Die ernährungsmedizinische Forschung konzentriert sich auf die Einflussnahme auf das Krankheitsgeschehen. Hinweise gibt es z. B. für die Zufuhr von n-3- und n-6-Fettsäuren oder Vitamin D. Die Literatur hierzu ist umfangreich, erlaubt aber keine generalisierbare Aussage über wirksame Ernährungsstrategien oder Supplementation explizit für MS-Kranke. Unabhängig von dieser Zielsetzung, besteht aber auch Bedarf, MS-Kranke bezüglich ihrer reellen Ernährungsrisiken adäquat zu beraten bzw. zu behandeln. Ein in der Zielgruppe noch zu evaluierendes Konzept erarbeiteten Adam et al. mit der „Anti Entzündlichen Diät“ (AED). Originär für rheumatische Erkrankungen entwickelt, lag aufgrund pathologischer Parallelen die Adaptation für MS nahe. Das Wirkprinzip beruht u. a. auf Modifikation der alimentären Fettzufuhr, basierend auf den generellen Empfehlungen für eine ausgewogene Ernährung und einer flexiblen, nichtrestriktiven Umsetzung.",

      "abstract": "About one-third of people with major depressive disorder (MDD) fail at least two antidepressant drug trials at 1 year. Together with clinical and experimental evidence indicating that the pathophysiology of MDD is multifactorial, this observation underscores the importance of elucidating mechanisms beyond monoaminergic dysregulation that can contribute to the genesis and persistence of MDD. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are mechanistically linked to the presence of neurovascular dysfunction with blood-brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability in selected neurological disorders, such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. In contrast to other major psychiatric disorders, MDD is frequently comorbid with such neurological disorders and constitutes an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in disorders characterized by vascular endothelial dysfunction (cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus). Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are implicated in the neurobiology of MDD. More recent evidence links neurovascular dysfunction with BBB hyperpermeability to MDD without neurological comorbidity. We review this emerging literature and present a theoretical integration between these abnormalities to those involving oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in MDD. We discuss our hypothesis that alterations in endothelial nitric oxide levels and endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling are central mechanistic links in this regard. Understanding the contribution of neurovascular dysfunction with BBB hyperpermeability to the pathophysiology of MDD may help to identify novel therapeutic and preventative approaches.",

In der Zusammenschau lässt sich schlussfolgern, dass schizophrenen Patienten eine große Bandbreite perzeptueller, motorischer und kognitiver Fertigkeiten durch Übung verbessern können. Die Lernraten sind trotz eines häufig reduzierten Ausgangsniveaus vergleichbar mit denen gesunder Probanden. Dagegen haben schizophrenen Patienten Schwierigkeiten, von unbekannten zugrunde liegenden Strukturen oder Regeln in den verwendeten Stimuli zu profitieren. Implizite Lernleistungen werden wenig von der Symptomschwere, wahrscheinlich aber von der Medikation beeinflusst.

      "title": "PIK3CA-Related Segmental Overgrowth",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth includes disorders of brain (e.g., MCAP [megalencephaly-capillary malformation] syndrome, hemimegalencephaly); and segmental body overgrowth (e.g., CLOVES [congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies] syndrome, fibroadipose hyperplasia [FH]). Heterozygous (usually somatic mosaic) pathogenic variants of PIK3CA are causative. MCAP syndrome is characterized by the major findings of (1) megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) associated with neurologic findings of hypotonia, seizures, and mild to severe intellectual disability; and (2) cutaneous capillary malformations with focal or generalized somatic overgrowth. Additional findings can include digital anomalies (syndactyly, polydactyly), cortical malformations – most distinctively polymicrogyria (PMG); and variable connective tissue dysplasia. CLOVES (or CLOVE) syndrome and fibroadipose hyperplasia (FH) may be associated with (1) MEG or HMEG; and (2) patchy segmental overgrowth associated with skeletal anomalies, lipomatosis, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi. Diagnosis/testing PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is confirmed in an individual with a pathogenic variant on one PIK3CA allele, typically in affected tissues. Because the vast majority of PIK3CA pathogenic variants arise postzygotic (and are thus mosaic), more than one tissue may need to be tested. Failure to detect a PIK3CA pathogenic variant does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of the PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth disorders in individuals with suggestive features. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant or lipomatous segmental overgrowth may require debulking; scoliosis and leg-length discrepancy may require orthopedic care and surgical intervention. Neurologic complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, progressive and/or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia or Chiari malformation; epilepsy in those with HMEG) may warrant neurosurgical intervention. Routine treatment of the following, when present, is indicated: cardiac and renal abnormalities; intellectual disabilities and behavior problems; motor difficulties; speech, swallowing, and feeding difficulties. Surveillance: MCAP syndrome: Follow up no less than every six months until age six years and at least yearly thereafter to monitor for neurosurgical complications, breathing or sleep disorders, seizures and orthopedic complications. Provisionally recommended imaging in early childhood includes brain MRI every six months for the first two years, then yearly until age eight years for neurologic complications (e.g., hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia). Consider screening for Wilms tumor following the protocol suggested for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (by ultrasound examination every 3 months until age 8 years); however, tumor risk in PIK3CA-related segmental overgrowth is undetermined and appears to be lower than in BWS. CLOVES syndrome and FH: Monitoring for severe scoliosis, infiltrative lipomatous overgrowth, paraspinal high-flow lesions with spinal cord ischemia, lymphatic malformations, cutaneous vesicles, orthopedic problems, central phlebectasias, and thromboembolism. Genetic counseling PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is not typically inherited. Most affected individuals with MCAP reported to date (21/24) had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA, suggesting that mutation occurred post-fertilization in one cell of the multicellular embryo. Two of 24 affected individuals had a de novo germline pathogenic variant in PIK3CA. All reported individuals with CLOVES and FH had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA. No confirmed instances of vertical transmission or sib recurrence have been reported. Because family members are not known to have an increased risk, prenatal diagnosis is usually not indicated for family members.",

      "title": "Psychological and Psychiatric Triggers and Risk Factors for Stroke",
      "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that psychiatric and/or psychological factors could be independent risk factors for stroke. Some of these factors may act as stroke triggers producing short-term physiological changes that may directly lead to stroke onset. Most data is related to four distinct domains: (1) depression and/or anxiety and related syndromes, (2) personality and character traits, (3) psychological stress, and (4) psychotropic medication. Some factors (e.g., depression) are closely related to stroke risk, and there is some evidence that psychological stress could be an important risk factor. However, many studies have methodological limitations (small sample size, lack of adjustment for stroke risk factors, or residual confounding) and lack of standardized definition and/or measurement. Data about stroke triggers is scarce but epidemiological studies suggest a triggering effect of acute or subacute life stress exposure. The potential pathophysiological ways by which psychiatric and/or psychological factors may promote stroke include a higher frequency of unhealthy behaviors and direct biological effects on the cardiovascular system, notably through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. More research is still needed to improve measurement and to better investigate the impact of psychiatric and/or psychological factors. The clarification of pathophysiological mechanisms could help to consider preventive strategies.",

      "title": "Promoting Physical Activity in People with Brain Impairments",
      "abstract": "Brain impairment is defined as a significant loss or abnormality in the brain structure. Brain impairments may be acquired as a result of trauma (e.g., traumatic brain injury or stroke), non-traumatic origins (e.g., tumour) or disease (e.g., Parkinsonrs disease or multiple sclerosis) or congenital (e.g., cerebral palsy) and are frequently associated with abnormal brain function (e.g., impaired memory, executive function and/ or impaired motor control). Evidence indicates that physical activity is beneficial for individuals with brain impairment as the subsequent loss of cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength and flexibility that occurs as a result of inactivity can compound the effects of the initial disability. Current cross-sectional evidence indicates that individuals with brain impairment are significantly less active than individuals without brain impairment. In order to address the low levels of physical activity in adults with brain impairment and thereby improve health, fitness and functioning, it is critical to develop interventions which effectively promote physically active behaviour in this population. The overall aim of the program of research described in this thesis is to contribute to the development and implementation of evidence-based physical activity promotion strategies in individuals with brain impairment. This thesis presents studies relating to two major subpopulations of people with brain impairment: adolescents with cerebral palsy (Chapters Three and Four); and adults with brain impairment (Chapters Five and Six). Chapter Three presents a systematic review of the clinimetric properties of objective and subjective measures of physical activity in adolescents with cerebral palsy. Seven measures were included in this review. Each measure had notable limitations related to the assessment of physical activity intensity and duration and compliance with the physical activity guidelines. The review identified accelerometry as a promising means of measuring physical activity as it is objective and can collect real-time activity data on the frequency, intensity, and duration of activity, allowing for meaningful comparison to the physical activity guidelines. Chapter Four presents a study that evaluated the validity of the ActiGraph accelerometer for the measurement of physical activity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy. Results indicated that the ActiGraph is able to differentiate between different intensities of walking and that, for the purpose of classifying activity intensity, the cut-points developed by Evenson et al. for typically developing children had excellent classifaction accuracy for detecting moderate to vigorous physical activity. These findings indicate that the ActiGraph is a suitable device for measuring free-living ambulatory physical activity among children and adolescents with cerebral palsy and that the output can be used to make meaningful comparisons to the physical activity guidelines. Chapter Five presents a systematic review of the research relating to physical activity and adults with brain impairment mapped against the five phases of a behavioral epidemiological framework. Results indicated that the vast majority of research to date has focused on identifying the benefits of physical activity for people with brain impairment; that measures previously used to evaluate physical activity participation do not allow meaningful comparison to the physical activity guidelines; that the evidence relating to correlates of physical activity has been largely concerned with levels of impairment and self-efficacy and; there is a relative paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions that promote physically active behaviour in this population. Currently there are no studies that evaluate the translation of physical activity interventions previously shown to be successful in controlled efficacy or effectiveness studies into widespread practice. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that future studies should consider a community-based rehabilitation model of intervention and that the rigor of such studies would be enhanced by the use of objective measures of physical activity. Chapter Six presents the results of a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a physical activity promotion intervention for community-dwelling adults with brain impairment. The intervention utilised elements of a community-based rehabilitation approach to deliver a lifestyle intervention to community-dwelling adults with brain impairment and outcomes were evaluated using an objective measure of physical activity. After the 12-week program, intervention participants exhibited significant increases in average counts per minute (cpm) (60.9 p 20.7 cpm, p= .004) and daily average time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (10.4 p 4.0 mins MVPA, p= .01). Daily counts per minute and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity declined significantly among attention controls (-11.1 p 22.9 cpm; -2.6 p 4.5 mins MVPA). Net differences in daily counts per minute and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity were 71.9 cpm (p= .02) and 12.9 mins MVPA (p= .03), respectively. Between-condition differences in the physical activity outcomes were not significant at 3-months follow-up. These findings are noteworthy given the particularly low rates of physical activity participation in this population and the significant physical and environmental barriers that individuals with brain impairment face. Given the rigour of the study, the results are sufficiently positive to warrant conducting a larger scale effectiveness trial utilising trained practitioners in clinical practice settings.n",

      "title": "Developmental Dyslexia: An Update",
      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have soft signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is characterized by a variety of cognitive dysfunctions. Information-processing dysfunctions differ between clinical subtypes such that nonparanoid schizophrenia patients attend less than paranoid schizophrenia patients to connotative or contextual aspects of stimuli. The positive and negative symptom dimensions are also associated with distinct cognitive deficits. In general, positive symptoms are related to auditory-processing deficits and negative symptoms to visual/motor dysfunctions. The interaction of frontal and septohippocampal brain systems, and failures of information-processing automaticity and self-monitoring, have been proposed as the bases of positive symptoms. Negative symptoms are thought to arise from abnormalities in the complex interactions of frontal and striatal systems. Recent theoretical analyses have recommended a focus on the cognitive and neuropsychological analysis of specific symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) instead of on the more heterogeneous symptom clusters or dimensions. Studies of specific symptoms indicate that patients with hallucinations have deficits in discriminating the source of information. Delusions have been related to abnormal inference processes as well as abnormal perceptual experiences. Studies should now examine the links between information-processing abnormalities and symptoms over time, as the latter change, within the framework of explicit, disconfirmable theoretical models.",

      "title": "Reversible dementias.",
      "abstract": "In recent years, more attention has been given to the early diagnostic evaluation of patients with dementia which is essential to identify patients with cognitive symptoms who may have treatable conditions. Guidelines suggest that all patients presenting with dementia or cognitive symptoms should be evaluated with a range of laboratory tests, and with structural brain imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While many of the disorders reported as 'reversible dementias' are conditions that may well be associated with cognitive or behavioral symptoms, these symptoms are not always sufficiently severe to fulfill the clinical criteria for dementia. Thus, while the etiology of a condition may be treatable it should not be assumed that the associated dementia is fully reversible. Potentially reversible dementias should be identified and treatment considered, even if the symptoms are not sufficiently severe to meet the clinical criteria for dementia, and even if partial or full reversal of the cognitive symptoms cannot be guaranteed. In the literature, the most frequently observed potentially reversible conditions identified in patients with cognitive impairment or dementia are depression, adverse effects of drugs, drug or alcohol abuse, space-occupying lesions, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and metabolic conditions land endocrinal conditions like hypothyroidism and nutritional conditions like vitamin B-12 deficiency. Depression is by far the most common of the potentially reversible conditions. The review, hence addresses the common causes of reversible dementia and the studies published so far.",

Cognitive enhancers can improve intellectual function and have been approved for Alzheimer’s dementia, dementia of Parkinson’s disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Cognitive enhancers are being developed for other cognitive disorders. There are many advantages for development of symptomatic cognitive enhancers compared to disease-modifying agents. Cognitive enhancers typically modulate transmitter systems. Cross-disease phenotypes such as executive function impairment may represent a development strategy for cognitive enhancing agents. Life cycle management strategies for cognitive enhancers include expanding indications to disorders with related pathophysiology or to different stages of disease severity and development of alternate formulations. Cognitive enhancers can restore essential cognitive capability and are a critical element of optimal care of patients with neurologic and psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Integrated pathophysiology of schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder as monoamine axon disorder",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide evidence that similar to early-stage Parkinson’s disease, depression is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of monoamine axons. The major difference between the two disorders is that the symptoms of depression become evident without loss of monoamine neurons, while the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease appear after loss of the cell body. Given that the axonal degeneration of monoamine neurons underlies the pathophysiology of neurological (Parkinson’s disease) and neuropsychiatric (depression) diseases, axonal impairment of monoamine neurons is thought to also occur in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and play a significant role in the pathophysiology of these mental illnesses. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia and manic symptoms of bipolar disorder are known to occur in hyper-monoaminergic states, opposite to depressive symptoms, negative/cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, and motor disorders of Parkinson’s disease, all occurring in hypo-monoaminergic states. Since monoamine axons have the capacity to spontaneously regenerate or sprout in response to damage in the adult brain and sometimes show hyperinnervation due to excessive regeneration/sprouting beyond normal levels, it is possible that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are disorders that include excessive regeneration/sprouting of monoamine axons leading to hyper-monoaminergic states. Together, based on accumulating data from animal and human studies, the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder is summarized as follows: The degeneration of monoamine axons is associated with the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, major and bipolar depression, while hyper-regeneration/sprouting of monoamine axons underlies the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar mania. The integrated understanding of schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder as monoamine axon disorder will open the door to the development of new diagnosis and treatment methods for major mental illnesses as well as early-stage Parkinson’s disease.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Reflex seizures occur in a broad range of epilepsies, including common epilepsies such as idiopathic (or genetic) generalized epilepsies, and more rare epilepsy syndromes such as progressive myoclonic epilepsies and other monogenic conditions. Idiopathic generalized epilepsies have a polygenic basis, with multiple gene variants contributing to the disorder—but in the typical idiopathic generalized epilepsy clinical presentation, no diagnostic genetic test is indicated. However, several monogenic conditions have been recognized in recent years, with intellectual disability and generalized and reflex seizures, which need be differentiated from the idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Rare epilepsy syndromes include conditions caused by chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., trisomy 21), copy number variants, or single gene abnormalities (e.g., progressive myoclonic epilepsies, familial adult myoclonic epilepsy, Dravet syndrome, others with photosensitivity, or other reflex seizures caused by pathogenic varints in CACNA1A, CDKL5, CHD2, GNAO1, LGI1, NEXMIF, NOVA2, MECP2, PURA, RORB, SYN1, SYNGAP1). These genetic syndromes featuring reflex seizures are at times identified based on their electroclinical characteristics, but need be confirmed by specific genetic testing, ranging from karyotyping, chromosomal microarray analysis, direct Sanger sequencing of the target gene, next-generation sequencing panels of epilepsy genes, trio-based whole exome, or genome sequencing. Although the choice of the most appropriate genetic testing is based on the clinical presentation, it is not uncommon for wide-spectrum genetic testing to reveal an underlying abnormality in patients with reflex seizures, even when their characteristics do not suggest a specific genetic etiology.",

Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition.

      "abstract": "RESUMO: Introducao: Epilepsia e uma desordem cerebral caracterizada pela predisposicao duradoura para ocorrencia de crises epilepticas, as quais sao a expressao clinica de descargas neuronais corticais hipersincronicas. Sem fronteiras raciais, geograficas ou sociais, a epilepsia e uniformemente distribuida em todo o mundo, com predominio na populacao idosa. A caracterizacao clinica das crises e suficiente para o diagnostico, mas este pode ser refinado por exames complementares (eletroencefalograma e neuroimagem). Tais crises podem reproduzir ou bloquear todos os tipos de comportamento motores e nao motores: desde crises convulsivas tonico-clonicas generalizadas, ate piloerecao em antebraco, por exemplo. As manifestacoes atipicas dessas crises foram definidas pela semiologia clinica, quando atenderem aos seguintes criterios: nao estiverem descritas na Classificacao Internacional das Crises Epilepticas e/ou sua semiologia clinica for sugestiva de crise nao epileptica e o eletroencefalograma (EEG) comprovar que se trata de crise epileptica. O amplo espectro clinico dessas crises frequentemente promove um retardo no diagnostico, ocasionando prejuizos ao tratamento e prognostico. Destaca-se a necessidade de reconhecer as crises atipicas, a fim de diminuir o numero de pacientes subdiagnosticados e, portanto, sem o tratamento adequado. Pretende-se, por meio deste estudo, avaliar a prevalencia e a semiologia das crises epilepticas atipicas (CEA) nos pacientes diagnosticados com epilepsia. Metodologia: Estudo transversal, com 1244 pacientes atendidos no ambulatorio de epilepsia do Hospital Universitario da Universidade Federal de Alagoas (HU-UFAL), entre fevereiro de 2013 e maio de 2019. A presenca de CEA, sua semiologia ictal e sua relacao com o perfil epidemiologico dos pacientes foram analisadas. Foram incluidos os pacientes diagnosticados com epilepsia e excluidos 305 pacientes, por apresentarem um diagnostico duvidoso de epilepsia e/ou por terem comprometimento cognitivo suficiente para comprometer a clareza das informacoes prestadas. Resultados e discussao: Foi observada uma prevalencia de 5,79% de pacientes com componente atipico de crises epilepticas, dos quais 1,85% apresentaram crises exclusivamente atipicas. Neste grupo, observou-se a hegemonia do sexo feminino e de pacientes com idade acima de 50 anos, ambos com prevalencia de 60,8%. Alem disso, nos pacientes com CEA, houve um predominio evidente de crises com um componente focal, com sindrome epileptica indeterminada,  exame neurologico normal e com uma frequencia  de mais de uma crise por mes. Conclusao: As crises epilepticas atipicas descritas no trabalho caracterizam-se por manifestacoes escassamente ou nunca descritas na literatura. A nossa proposta de definicao de CEA ajudou a caracterizar esse tipo de crise e a situa-la no contexto das CE em geral. Observamos uma expressiva prevalencia de CEA nos pacientes com epilepsia. Reconhecer essas crises facilita o diagnostico precoce das epilepsias. A partir desse diagnostico, pode-se identificar as causas subjacentes, potencialmente trataveis. Desse modo, sera possivel mudar o prognostico do controle das crises e de suas causas, como tumores cerebrais, encefalites, acidentes vasculares cerebrais, disturbios metabolicos.",

It occurs more frequently in AD than in older adults without dementia. The underlying biology remains obscure. We aimed to identify patterns of differential gene expression in individuals with depression in AD compared to individuals with AD but no history of depressive illness. Method We used data from the Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging Project: the ROSMAP cohort. Individuals with other disorders which could have caused cognitive impairment e.g. Parkinson’s disease(n = 122) or clinically significant head trauma (n = 234) were excluded, and those with bipolar disorder(n = 13). Those with neuropathological or consensus clinical evidence of a dementia other than Alzheimer’s disease were also excluded (n = 116). Depression caseness was defined as a highly probable/probable clinical diagnosis of depression made by the assessing clinician at a study visit or a CESD score of &gt;7 at a study visit. Individuals with treated depression (n = 301) who were taking antidepressants but never met depression caseness criteria and 380 individuals with subthreshold depressive symptoms on the CESD but a clinical assessment that depression was “not present” were also excluded. RNAseq data was available from the DLPFC and posterior cingulate. The posterior cingulate analysis is ongoing. Fastq files were quality controlled using fastqc and Picard following HISAT2 alignment to GRCh38. After exclusion of files which failed QC fastq files were aligned to the GRCh38 transcriptome using Salmon. Files with low transcriptome alignment (&lt;28%) were also excluded. Differential gene expression analysis was carried out in Rstudio using DEseq2. Result After exclusions and QC, data was available for 15 individuals with depression &amp; AD and 25 individuals with AD but no depression for the DLPFC. Age, RIN, sex and Braak stage were included in the analysis model. After adjustment of the p value for multiple comparison 64 genes were differentially expressed in depression including Fbox proteins, nucleosome assembly proteins and voltage‐gated channel proteins. KEGG pathway analysis is underway Conclusion We have identified genes differentially expressed in depression in AD which may allow better understanding of this condition.",

      "title": "The Phenomenology of Depressive States",
      "abstract": "Résumé1. Une étude des données épidémiologiques met en lumière le rapport qui existe entre les formes plus graves des états dépressifs et la fin de l'âge mûr la vieillesse et la feminité.2. L'expérience acquise grâce aux traitements physiques utilisés en psychiatrie au cours des vingt-cinq dernières années confirme dans l'ensemble l'existence de deux types comparativement distincts d'état dépressif, l'un basé sur une prédisposition spécifique, l'autre sur une vulnérabilité générale vis-à-vis de laquelle les individus ne diffèrent qu'au point de vue du degré. Ces deux groupes diffèrent quant à leur image clinique—son inconstance et ses conséquences aussi bien que par le type de prédisposition—plutôt que par la présence ou l'absence de causes environnantes de la maladie.3. Le rapport entre les états anxieux et les états dépressifs est discuté avec mention particulière d'un nouveau syndrome qui habituellement se manifeste tout à coup après un malheur ou une grave maladie physique. Ce dérangement est plus fréquent chez les femmes qui auraient tendance à être rigides et dépendantes d'autrui. Le noyau même de la maladie est une dépersonnalisation qui se combine avec une forme caractérisée de phobie anxieuse; cette combinaison se trouve accompagnée de symptômes plus variables de dépression, d'obsession, d'hystérie, d'hypocondrie et parfois de psychose de courte durée. Les symptômes de dépression peuvent être plus évidents particulièrement chez des malades plus âgées—mais un traitement d'électrochoc ne fait habituellement qu'aggraver la maladie. On considère que les faits connus sont à l'encontre du concept d'une seule et unique famille des maladies affectives où les différents types de réactions se fondraient insensiblement les uns dans les autres.4. Les observations récentes ne confirment pas le concept d'un état dépressif d'un type spécifiquement involutif. Mais des preuves permettraient de suggérer que ceux qui passent par un état dépressif pour la première fois à un âge avancé sont moins prédisposés de naissance aux dépressions nerveuses que ceux dont la maladie s'est révélée quand ils étaient plus jeunes. Dans le premier cas une force exogène est le point de départ le plus fréquent et la dépression se complique souvent de troubles physiques, particulièrement chez les hommes.5. Le rapport qui existe entre d'infimes altérations de la conscience et certaines formes de réactions dépressives est discuté en se basant particulièrement sur les psychoses 'psychogènes', les états dits 'schizophréniformes', les psychoses des épileptiques et des alcooliques et les symptômes affectifs associés avec les maladies somatiques aiguës.6. Discussion du rapport qui existe entre les symptômes d'hypocondrie et d'ob-session et les états dépressifs. Plus les symptômes précédents seront prononcés en relation avec l'état dépressif, plus le cours de la maladie et la réaction au traitement seront éloignés de ceux de la dépression endogène. Il est suggéré que l'hypocondrie existe en tant que telle aussi bien qu'en tant de symptôme d'un état dépressif. Description de quelques formes cliniques de cette maladie.7. Les états de dépression sont parmi les plus communs des maux humains. L'incidence morbide des seuls cas endogènes est d'environ 1–2%, ce qui implique une plus grande fréquence que pour toute autre maladie provoquée par un mécanisme génétique spécifique. L'auteur met ces faits en relation avec la psychopathologie et avec la signification biologique des états dépressifs.",

Transient global amnesia is sometimes precipitated by a psychological or physiological stress. Transient global amnesia also must be distinguished from psychogenic amnesia and from factitious amnesia. Usually no physical symptoms are associated with transient global amnesia. Any physical symptoms should raise the possibility of an alternative etiology for the patient's amnesia. The characteristic presentation of transient global amnesia is a sudden loss of ability to form new memories. Patients who develop transient global amnesia generally are taken by companions to an emergency room. Neuropsychological testing after multiple attacks may reveal more memory impairment as well as visuoperceptual deficits. Transient global amnesia is rare in young or middle-age adults. It is relatively common in individuals who are over 50 years old.",

      "title": "Functional cognitive disorder: dementia’s blind spot",
      "abstract": "Abstract An increasing proportion of cognitive difficulties are recognized to have a functional cause, the chief clinical indicator of which is internal inconsistency. When these symptoms are impairing or distressing, and not better explained by other disorders, this can be conceptualized as a cognitive variant of functional neurological disorder, termed functional cognitive disorder (FCD). FCD is likely very common in clinical practice but may be under-diagnosed. Clinicians in many settings make liberal use of the descriptive term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for those with cognitive difficulties not impairing enough to qualify as dementia. However, MCI is an aetiology-neutral description, which therefore includes patients with a wide range of underlying causes. Consequently, a proportion of MCI cases are due to non-neurodegenerative processes, including FCD. Indeed, significant numbers of patients diagnosed with MCI do not ‘convert’ to dementia. The lack of diagnostic specificity for MCI ‘non-progressors’ is a weakness inherent in framing MCI primarily within a deterministic neurodegenerative pathway. It is recognized that depression, anxiety and behavioural changes can represent a prodrome to neurodegeneration; empirical data are required to explore whether the same might hold for subsets of individuals with FCD. Clinicians and researchers can improve study efficacy and patient outcomes by viewing MCI as a descriptive term with a wide differential diagnosis, including potentially reversible components such as FCD. We present a preliminary definition of functional neurological disorder–cognitive subtype, explain its position in relation to other cognitive diagnoses and emerging biomarkers, highlight clinical features that can lead to positive diagnosis (as opposed to a diagnosis of exclusion), and red flags that should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses. In the research setting, positive identifiers of FCD will enhance our recognition of individuals who are not in a neurodegenerative prodrome, while greater use of this diagnosis in clinical practice will facilitate personalized interventions.",

      "title": "Clinical approach to the weak patient in the intensive care unit.",
      "abstract": "Motor weakness in a patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) may be related to (1) pre-existing neuromuscular disorder that leads to ICU admission, (2) new-onset or previously undiagnosed neurological disorder, or (3) complications of non-neuromuscular critical illness. Neuromuscular syndromes related to ICU treatment consist of critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, and prolonged neuromuscular blockade, and are now recognized as a frequent cause of newly acquired weakness in ICU patients. Clinical features include quadriparesis, muscle wasting, and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. Evaluation of these patients is based on knowledge of clinical setting and predisposing factors, focused neurological examination, detailed electrophysiological investigation, serum creatine kinase level, other laboratory studies as needed, and histological examination of muscle biopsy. If a central nervous system (brain or spinal cord) lesion is suspected, neuroimaging studies are required. In addition to conventional nerve conduction and needle electromyography, phrenic nerve conduction, diaphragm electromyography, blink reflex, and (recently) the technique of direct muscle stimulation have been employed. Critical illness polyneuropathy is an axonal motor and sensory neuropathy that often follows sepsis and multiorgan failure. Risk factors for critical illness myopathy are corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking drugs, acute respiratory illness, and organ transplant. Three subtypes (acute necrotizing myopathy, thick myosin filament loss myopathy, and type II fiber atrophy) are recognized. Major differential diagnoses of critical illness related paralysis are incidental Guillain-Barré syndrome and unmasked myasthenia gravis. Rarely, atypical presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polymyositis or other myopathies, and precipitation of porphyria or rhabdomyolysis due to drugs used in the ICU have been described. Recently a poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis due to West Nile virus infection was reported. A subgroup of patients with myasthenia gravis with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibody is noted to present as respiratory crisis. Muscle biopsy in ICU paralysis syndromes may be helpful in arriving at a specific diagnosis or to classify the type of critical illness myopathy. Nerve biopsy is only rarely indicated.",

      "title": "What is the Relationship of Traumatic Brain Injury to Dementia?",
      "abstract": "There is a long history linking traumatic brain injury (TBI) with the development of dementia. Despite significant reservations, such as recall bias or concluding causality for TBI, a summary of recent research points to several conclusions on the TBI-dementia relationship. 1) Increasing severity o f a single moderate-to-severe TBI increases the risk of subsequent Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. 2) Repetitive, often subconcussive, mild TBIs increases the risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative neuropathology. 3) TBI may be a risk factor for other neurodegenerative disorders that can be associated with dementia. 4) TBI appears to lower the age of onset of TBI-related neurocognitive syndromes, potentially adding \"TBI cognitive-behavioral features\". The literature further indicates several specific risk factors for TBI-associated dementia: 5) any blast or blunt physical force to the head as long as there is violent head displacement; 6) decreased cognitive and/or neuronal reserve and the related variable of older age at TBI; and 7) the presence of apolipoprotein E ɛ4 alleles, a genetic risk factor for AD. Finally, there are neuropathological features relating TBI with neurocognitive syndromes: 8) acute TBI results in amyloid pathology and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies; 9) CTE shares features with neurodegenerative dementias; and 10) TBI results in white matter tract and neural network disruptions. Although further research is needed, these ten findings suggest that dose-dependent effects of violent head displacement in vulnerable brains predispose to dementia; among several potential mechanisms is the propagation of abnormal proteins along damaged white matter networks.",

How can other clinical conditions and mental states, besides brain damage, influence memory? Different subtypes of amnesia have different characteristics. The study of amnesia is important as a way of discriminating between memory processes and in linking deficits in remembering with specific neurological structures that are damaged. Not all memory disorders arise from organic injury or illness. ‘Psychogenic amnesia’ is usually caused by a functional impairment of memory with no tangible evidence of neurological brain injury.",

In many instances it may reasonably be supposed that subjective feelings of pain or discomfort in the stomach, leading to the refusal of food, arise from organic disease or functional disorder of that organ. That there is a centre in the brain, disorder of which causes a distaste for food, has been suggested, but is scarcely worthy of serious consideration. The cause is more likely to be some local affection, such as malignant disease, gastric ulcer, or simple gastritis, giving rise to pain on the ingestion of food; the refusal of food is then the translation of a protest from a stomach in an unfit state to receive any but the lightest food.",

The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

In this report, we describe the case of a 39-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain for three days and whose illness became progressively drowsy on the fifth day. Based on clinical assessment, nerve conduction studies, and biochemical, microbiological, and radiological investigations, other causes were ruled out and it was concluded that the patient had hyponatremia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) due to GBS. Although sensory symptoms like pain or dysaesthesias occurring in the back or extremities are common and may precede motor weakness, abdominal pain remains a very rare presentation of GBS. GBS is usually understood as a \"pure\" peripheral nervous system disorder but central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction may occur due to metabolic abnormalities (like hyponatremia and CO2 narcosis) or autonomic dysfunction in GBS, its treatment, or due to GBS itself (Anti-GQ1b disease variant).",

      "abstract": "Epileptic seizures and epilepsy appear frequent in the elderly. The diagnosis is often more difficult and therapeutic decisions are often debated. In this context, the implementation of a rigorous analysis and reasoning to correctly determine the various components at the origin of the epileptic seizure is fundamental. Some data are in favor of a decrease of the epileptogenic threshold with advancing age. But, this is in no way sufficient to account for the occurrence of a seizure. It is necessary to add to aging factor a chronic pathology responsible for brain lesions (micro or macroscopic: stroke, Alzheimer's disease, brain tumors...) and/or acute aggression (trauma, central nervous system infection, metabolic or toxic disorders...) to trigger a seizure. It is notable that an association of some mild brain lesions and a weak metabolic disturbance could trigger a seizure. In these cases, the probability of trigger a new seizure with another mild precipitant factor appears very high. This analysis is necessary and particularly useful in these multi-pathological patients. It also makes it easier to decide whether to start antiepileptic treatment. In case of a triggering factor such as hyponatremia, for example, in the absence of associated underlying lesions, it seems legitimate not to start treatment at the first epileptic seizure. On the other hand, if hyponatremia (often less deep than in the previous case) is associated with sequel of stroke or Alzheimer's disease, it seems reasonable to start treatment quickly.",

It is true that there are a great number of oligophrenia syndromes with known aetiology, but together they represent a numerically small group.

However, the sexual problems affecting women with neurological disease are not well described. The etiology of female sexual dysfunction in neurological conditions is multifactorial. There are both psychological and physiological etiologies that can be difficult to separate. The more common psychological problems arise from difficulty adapting to a chronic, and sometimes progressive, illness. Physiological causes of sexual dysfunction in neurological disease include disruption of regions of the cerebral cortex mediating sexual behavior and response; neuroendocrine or neurochemical dysfunction; and motor, sensory, or autonomic neuropathy Sexual dysfunction may be a consequence of the neurological disease or the pharmacologic therapy. Female sexual dysfunction in neurological conditions affecting primarily the autonomic nervous system has not been well studied. It is important for physicians to recognize symptoms of sexual dysfunction since there are treatments available that can improve the patient's quality of life.",

These and other movement disorders may also occur as presenting or prominent features of general neurological disorders such as stroke, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or CNS tumors. Moreover, they may also occur in the setting of a wide spectrum of systemic diseases, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, intoxications, hematological diseases, cancer, or infection. These latter situations where movement disorders are the hallmark of general neurologic or systemic conditions is when clinicians may face challenges of diagnosis and treatment.

      "title": "Pathomechanisms and Clinical Implications of Myasthenic Syndromes Exacerbated and Induced by Medical Treatments",
      "abstract": "Myasthenic syndromes are typically characterized by muscle weakness and increased fatigability due to an impaired transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Most cases are caused by acquired autoimmune conditions such as myasthenia gravis (MG), typically with antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Different drugs are among the major factors that may complicate pre-existing autoimmune myasthenic conditions by further impairing transmission at the NMJ. Some clinical observations are substantiated by experimental data, indicating that presynaptic, postsynaptic or more complex pathomechanisms at the NMJ may be involved, depending on the individual compound. Most robust data exist for the risks associated with some antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, ketolides, fluoroquinolones) and cardiovascular medications (e.g., class Ia antiarrhythmics, beta blockers). Apart from primarily autoimmune-mediated disorders of the NMJ, de novo myasthenic manifestations may also be triggered by medical treatments that induce an autoimmune reaction. Most notably, there is growing evidence that the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), a modern class of drugs to treat various malignancies, represent a relevant risk factor to develop severe and progressive medication-induced myasthenia via an immune-mediated mechanism. From a clinical perspective, it is of utmost importance for the treating physicians to be aware of such adverse treatment effects and their consequences. In this article, we aim to summarize existing evidence regarding the key molecular and immunological mechanisms as well as the clinical implications of medication-aggravated and medication-induced myasthenic syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric nosology is widely criticized, but solutions are proving elusive. Planned revisions of diagnostic criteria will not resolve heterogeneity, comorbidity, fuzzy boundaries between normal and pathological, and lack of specific biomarkers. Concern about these difficulties reflects a narrow model that assumes most mental disorders should be defined by their etiologies. A more genuinely medical model uses understanding of normal function to categorize pathologies. For instance, understanding the function of a cough guides the search for problems causing it, and decisions about when it is expressed abnormally. Understanding the functions of emotions is a foundation missing from decisions about emotional disorders. The broader medical model used by the rest of medicine also recognizes syndromes defined by failures of functional systems or failures of feedback control. Such medical syndromes are similar to many mental diagnoses in their multiple causes, blurry boundaries, and nonspecific biomarkers. Dissatisfaction with psychiatric nosology may best be alleviated, not by new diagnostic criteria and categories, but by more realistic acknowledgment of the untidy landscape of mental and other medical disorders.",

This paper presents the neurological approach to such patients highlighting the clinical clues that need to be sought to decide whether the patient is in a persistent vegetative or minimally conscious state (i.e., showing any responsiveness to external stimuli), or alternatively suffering from a locked-in syndrome. This neurological clinical formulation is then assimilated with other tests and assessments from a range of medical specialities, and by so doing helps confirm the clinical impression. This multidisciplinary approach is vital in the assessment of such patients and ideally should also include neurophysiological and functional imaging paradigms.",

However, SA may also occur with the association between food and/or exercise plus one or more of the following other cofactors, such as drugs, especially non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory (NSAID), alcohol, infections, temperature variation, and menstrual cycle.

The true incidence of CNS manifestations attributable to SLE is not entirely clear, but several studies show prevalence rate between 15-75%, depending on criteria adopted. For cognitive impairment, the prevalence ranges from 17-59%. Cognitive impairment may be attributed to emotional distress, corticosteroid use, active systemic disease or primary CNS dysfunction. These manifestations may occur even in the absence of other neuropsychiatric [NP] manifestations clearly attributable to SLE. The etiology of cognitive impairment may be related to autoimmune mechanisms, such as brain-specific autoantibodies. Despite several studies using computer tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], brain structural abnormalities could not be associated with cognitive findings in SLE patients. Functional neuroimaging methods may be more sensitive for detecting subclinical brain involvement related to cognitive dysfunction in SLE. Despite the fact that cognitive impairment may be residual in patients with previous CNS involvement, it also may be an early marker of CNS involvement in previous asymptomatic patients. This article will review clinical assessment, pathogenic mechanism, and the role of neuroimaging methods in the evaluating of SLE patients with cognitive impairment. Keywords: Cognitive impairment, autoantibodies, brain imaging",

At the same time, some specific epileptic syndromes were indicated by the eponym of the first physician who originally described the condition (e.g., West syndrome, Dravet syndrome, Ohtahara syndrome, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome) or by some characteristic clinical features (e.g., nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, absence epilepsy, epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females). In many of these occurrences, the distinct epileptic syndrome was defined mainly by its most relevant clinical feature (e.g., seizure semiology), associated comorbidities, and electroencephalographic patterns.[3] [4]",

To diagnose absent brain function—some call it death by neurologic criteria—is a more detailed examination best done by a neurologist or neurosurgeon. Of course, in principle, any clinically experienced physician is qualified to determine death by neurologic criteria, but in our hospitals we noticed an increase in consulted neurointensivists, and perhaps this can be attributed to a poor comfort level of physicians less familiar with disorders of the nervous system. The diagnosis of brain death is neurocritical care territory because it gets to the fundamentals of pathophysiologic processes associated with acute brain injury.",

      "title": "SINTOMAS DEPRESSIVOS EM ACADÊMICOS DE UMA UNIVERSIDADE PÚBLICA NO OESTE DO ESTADO DO PARÁ, RELATO DE EXPERIÊNCIA",
      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A depressao e um disturbio do afeto e/ou do humor, que e caracterizado por sintomas como, piora do sono, do apetite, da auto-estima, pela tristeza, sentimento de culpa, entre outros. O individuo depressivo tem dificuldade em descrever experiencias emocionais positivas, sendo pouco aberto a sentimentos otimistas. Alem disso, na depressao nao existe apenas queixa de tristeza, mas tambem ha mudancas de humor que culminam em crises frequentes de explosao de raiva, que levam ao desgaste da saude fisica e emocional, prejuizos no convivio social, na aprendizagem e ideias e/ou tentativas frequentes de suicidio. Esse transtorno e considerado uma pandemia e a terceira maior causa a nivel global de doencas. Sao inumeros os fatores que podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento da depressao, como por exemplo, o baixo suporte social, a presenca de eventos estressantes, pensamentos negativos, problemas financeiros, entre outros. Alguns dados encontrados nos universitarios nesta pesquisa, sao considerados elevados, no que tange ao processo depressivo, e ganham maior destaque ainda quando comparados com a populacao em geral. Isso e possivel, pois e nessa fase academica que se exige muito esforco do adolescente ou jovem adulto, onde o mesmo deve aprender a lidar com uma gama de responsabilidades que estarao presentes em sua vida futura, tanto como academico, quanto como profissional. Estes incluem a adaptacao de cumprimento de prazos e horarios, a distância dos pais e demais familiares, a falta de motivacao para os estudos, dentre outros conflitos internos e/ou externos. Diante dessas informacoes, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em relatar a presenca de sinais e sintomas depressivos encontrados em academicos de uma instituicao de ensino superior em Santarem- PA, atraves de uma escuta qualificada. Desenvolvimento : Este estudo trata-se de um relato de experiencia acerca das vivencias durante uma acao em saude que ocorreu no dia 24 de abril de 2017 desenvolvida por academicos de enfermagem da Universidade do Estado do Para (UEPA) Campus XII-Santarem, a acao foi baseada na metodologia ativa da problematizacao segundo o Projeto Politico Pedagogico (PPP) do curso de enfermagem da UEPA para a Atividade Integrada em Saude que e um momento em que o academico de enfermagem integra todos os eixos da grade curricular do semestre, escolhendo assim um tema a ser abordado, assim como o publico, que foi composto de academicos dos cursos contemplados na universidade: enfermagem, musica, educacao fisica, medicina e fisioterapia. A tematica foi abordada atraves de acao educativa em saude, organizada pelos academicos do curso de enfermagem com diversos topicos como: alimentacao, avaliacao de risco para o desenvolvimento de doencas cronicas, avaliacao de medidas antropometricas e, nesta atividade, avaliacao da saude mental com a investigacao da existencia de sintomas depressivos. Durante a acao os academicos de enfermagem, em um primeiro momento, distribuiram folders contendo informacoes sobre a depressao e, posteriormente conversaram individualmente com cada academico que, de forma voluntaria, concordaram discutir sobre sintomas que, de acordo com o CID-10, poderiam estar sentindo. Durante a conversa os sintomas investigados foram: fadiga aumentada ou perda de energia fisica e mental, perda de interesse e prazer, classificados como sintomas fundamentais; apetite diminuido, atividade diminuida, auto-estima e autoconfianca diminuida, concentracao e atencao diminuida, sentimento de culpa e inutilidade, pensamentos e/ou atos lesivos ou suicidas, sono perturbado, visao pessimista do futuro, classificados como sintomas episodicos. Alem disso, a acao contou com a ajuda de um psicologo que atendeu os participantes que apresentaram sintomas graves da depressao. Os participantes que apresentaram maior necessidade foram orientados a buscar tratamento efetivo com intervencao de psicologo. Resultados : A maioria dos entrevistados mostraram-se bastante interessados no assunto e nao demonstravam muita timidez, apresentaram-se bem a vontade e com disposicao para dialogar, o que de certa forma surpreendeu a equipe, que esperava uma resistencia por parte dos academicos, com isso observou-se facilitacao do trabalho para a equipe dos entrevistadores. Apos a entrevista, os academicos de enfermagem, organizadores da acao, detectaram uma alta incidencia de sintomas fundamentais e episodicos em um numero significativos dos universitarios, o que pode ser considerado uma situacao preocupante. No decorrer da acao, muitos academicos participantes, relataram o quanto consideravam acoes desse genero, importantes na universidade, por sentirem-se sobrecarregados pelas atividades academicas, desorientados, desanimados e com pensamentos pessimistas. Podem ser classificados como poucas as acoes voltadas para os academicos, sobretudo, os academicos da area da saude, ja que eles sao os principais responsaveis por promoverem esse tipo de acoes e que acabam deixando de se cuidar, nao lembrando-se que tambem precisam de cuidado e atencao. Deste modo, e inegavel a grande satisfacao de poder contribuir de alguma forma para esta comunidade e acredita-se que, todos os academicos tiveram uma boa oportunidade de serem ouvidos de forma mais qualificada por um profissional apto a lhe dar orientacoes essenciais que visem a prevencao diagnostica, alem de recuperacao e promocao da saude mental. Consideracoes Finais : Apos a acao em saude, alguns academicos que se ausentaram no dia em que a acao ocorreu procuraram a equipe afim de, saberem se haveria outra acao semelhante, alegando que gostariam de serem ouvidos ou ate mesmo referindo interesse de um amigo (a) na consulta psicologica. Essa experiencia aponta para a necessidade de que academicos na area da saude devem cuidar da saude mental de forma frequente sem negligenciar as tensoes e o estresse advindos da propria universidade, antes de serem lancados no mercado de trabalho. Alem da necessidade de acompanhamento psicologico para os academicos nas proprias universidades, sejam elas publicas ou privadas, no decorrer da formacao afim de manter a saude mental e de prevenir, diagnosticar ou ainda tratar quadros depressivos e outras doencas mentais que podem comprometer seu rendimento academico e a sua saude geral, visando reduzir dados crescentes relacionados a sintomatologia da depressao em universitarios. Essa experiencia mostrou que mesmo em cursos da area da saude, a saude mental ainda e pouco debatida, precisando assim, de uma atencao tanto dos academicos com sua propria saude, como da instituicao de ensino, promovendo um espaco e profissionais capacitados que possam auxiliar enquanto o academico estiver em formacao.",

DSM-5에서는 DSM-IV와 동일한 10가지 성격장애의 범주적 접근을 유지하고 있다. 한편DSM-5의 Section III에는 차원-범주 혼합모형(hybrid dimensional-categorical model)이 제안되었다. 이로써 임상가는 개인의 성격기능에서의 어려움과 성격의 병리적 특질패턴에 근거하여 성격장애의 진단과 성격을 평가할 수 있다.",

      "abstract": "Summary: A variety of factors could potentially influence the occurrence of mental deterioration in epilepsy, including seizure type, age of seizure onset, seizure duration, and seizure severity. The available literature suggests that measures of severity are more predictive of progressive decreases in intellectual functioning. There is also evidence suggesting that seizure severity and cognitive deterioration might both be the result of underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities in some cases. In the majority of patients with epilepsy, however, with relatively less severe disease, there is little evidence for cognitive deterioration. Total seizure number also has an inverse correlation with level of psychosocial functioning in some studies, whereas others have found that patients with emotional difficulties have fewer seizures. In the case of emotional deterioration, the impact of interpersonal relationships and other environmental factors upon psychosocial outcome seems clear, and the evidence for specific pathophysiologic explanations for emotional deterioration, less convincing.",

      "abstract": "A variety of personality, behavioral, cognitive, social, and emotional changes typically follow traumatic brain injury. Standardized psychological tests are of limited value in assessing these individuals and may even be misleading. While neuropsychological testing is effective in discriminating the performance of brain damaged and non-brain damaged patients, the etiology of brain dysfunction must be inferred from the pattern of behavioral impairments and comparison to characteristic neurobehavioral patterns associated with specific types of neurological disorders. Strict reliance on test data can be misleading when testing patients with prominent orbital frontal lobe injury. The conditions of testing may also inadequately mask many of the patient's impairments and may lack sufficient \"ecological validity.\" Frequently psychologists fail to take a chronological history of the injury, the patient, or interview the family or significant others. Many reports focus on the patient's deficits and presumed site of injury rather than discuss the patient's strengths, coping strategies or compensatory behaviors.",

Als solcher wird Rückenschmerz definiert, der ohne identifizierbare anatomische und/oder neurophysiologische Faktoren auftritt. Davon abzugrenzen sind Rückenschmerzen bei Irritationen der Nervenwurzeln und anderen spinalen neurologischen Prozessen wie beispielsweise Tumorleiden oder entzündliche Prozesse. Als spezifische Rückenschmerzursachen können Faktoren identifiziert werden, wie Bandscheibenherniation, Spondylolisthesis, Spinalstenosen, Instabilität der Wirbelsäule, Wirbelfrakturen, Wirbeltumore, Infektionen oder entzündliche Erkrankungen. Patienten mit einer neurologisch identifizierbaren Lumboischialgie mit klarer radikulärer Ausbreitung gehören zur Gruppe der Patienten mit spezifischen Rückenschmerzen. Gemäß aktueller epidemiologischer Daten sind jedoch nur maximal 150/0 der Patienten mit Rückenschmerzen in diese bekannten spezifischen Ursachengruppen einzuordnen, der übergroße Teil von rund 850/0 der Rückenschmerzpatienten leidet an unspezifischen Rückenschmerzen.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric diagnostic constructs often have no zones of rarity between different diagnostic constructs, and they often co-occur. This happens even where clear disease processes are involved, such as the dementias. They may represent different areas of a spectrum of illness/condition and/or be part of a spectrum of illnesses/conditions. However, they share both these characteristics with many general medical diagnostic constructs. For spectrums of illness/condition this may be because there are no natural boundaries but that it is important or seems obvious to recognize different areas of the spectrum for reasons of clinical utility (such as different prognostic implications or treatments) or different clinical pictures. For spectrums of illnesses/conditions the reason for co-occurrence may be because different diagnostic constructs have similar causes/mechanisms. On the other hand, these problems of lack of boundaries are not present as commonly in general medical diagnostic constructs. Alternative mental health classifications do not have the same issues with co-occurrence. They may be more useful in research to discover reasons why co-occurrence of symptoms may occur but have pragmatic drawbacks for other classification functions.",

It shows a substantial clinical and pathophysiological similarity of neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia and gives preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia. The differential diagnosis of neuropathic, nociceptive, and psychogenic pain and the determination of the level of damage to the nervous system and a leading pathogenetic mechanism of neuropathic pain syndrome require not only meticulous clinical examination of the sensory sphere, but also neurophysiological examination including electroneuromyography, somatosensory evoked potential recording, quantitative sensory testing, and, in a number of cases, neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging) or morphological (intraepidermal nerve fiber density examination) verification of injury somatosensory afferents.",

Whether bipolar depression or general depression, whether accompanied with or without psychotic symptoms, or with or without cognitive impairment, there are clinical and possible biological differences in these depressions, which indicates that different subtypes of depression represented by different TCM syndromes not only are different clinical syndromes, but also imply that there may be some biomarkers. The melancholia with liver depression and stagnation is different from melancholia with deficiency of both heart and spleen in clinical symptoms, which may indicate that there are differences in some potential biological biomarkers. For example, central nervous transmitters, trace elements, electrophysiology, neuroendocrinology, brain imaging, and even genomics may differ among different TCM syndrome types of depression, which not only serves for the modernization of TCM, but also finds biological differences for different TCM syndrome types of depression.",

A report by the Institute of Medicine1 identified medication nonadherence as a notable source of medical errors.\r\n\r\nPoor adherence has been shown to decrease the effects of prescribed medications or other treatments and to increase the likelihood of poor outcomes.2 Adherence has been related to intermediate clinical outcomes in several diseases. An increased incidence of adverse events has been linked to nonadherence in the elderly.3\r\n\r\nElders' adherence to prescribed medications is a complex phenomenon that depends on an interaction of medical, medication, personal, and economic factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical factors that affect adherence include cognitive abilities, as well as overall health status (eg, number of chronic conditions).\r\n\r\n\r\nMedication factors related to adherence include the characteristics of the medication (eg, dosing frequency or presence of side effects).\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal factors that affect adherence include: \r\n\r\npersonal beliefs about the condition for which the medication is prescribed (eg, how serious the condition is and how likely the medication is to have a positive effect).\r\n\r\n\r\nindividual cognitive abilities, including memory, overall intellectual ability, organization skills, and health literacy.

However, a narrow medicalized view of suffering, solely defined as physical discomfort, ignores or minimizes the broader significance of the suffering experienced by debilitated chronically ill adults. A fundamental form of that suffering is the loss of self in chronically ill persons who observe their former self-images crumbling away without the simultaneous development of equally valued new ones. As a result of their illnesses, these individuals suffer from (1) leading restricted lives, (2) experiencing social isolation, (3) being discredited and (4) burdening others. Each of these four scores of suffering is analysed in relation to its effects on the consciousness of the ill person. The data are drawn from a qualitative study of 57 chronically ill persons with varied diagnoses.",

They often represent the first or main manifestation of underlying disorders of the central nervous system, which require specific work-up and treatment. Diverse and often combined cause factors have been identified. Although recent data provide some evidence regarding abnormal activation and/or disinhibition of motor circuits during sleep, for the majority of these disorders the pathogenetic mechanisms remain speculative. The differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult and misdiagnoses are not infrequent. The diagnosis is based on clinical and video-polysomnographic findings. Treatment of sleep-related motor disturbances with few exceptions (e.g. restless legs/limbs syndrome) are based mainly on anecdotal reports or small series.More state-of-the-art studies on the cause, pathophysiology, and treatment of sleep-related movement disorders and disturbances of motor control are needed.",

There are no official diagnostic criteria for cognitive repercussions of EI, which may lead to incorrect diagnostics and confusion with other most frequent causes of dementia, such as frontotemporal dementia, pseudodementia, or dementias for reversible causes. In this case report, we described a right-handed man, aged 56 years old, referred to our service due to behavioral changes and cognitive alterations related to electric shock. The psychiatric team has monitored him, but cognitive deficits have raised doubts about the presence of dementia syndrome. The neuropsychological evaluation revealed severe deficits and loss of functionality, which filled the criteria for major neurocognitive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-5). Adding these findings to the patient's history and after a detailed investigation of other causes of dementia, we concluded that this is a possible case of EI with strong neuropsychological symptoms. This case report should help clinicians to recognize this condition and its features. We aimed to share the importance of recognizing the neuropsychological and psychiatric features of EI, mainly in the Brazilian context.",

За період 2010–2015 рр. нами проведено контрольоване проспективне рандомізоване когортне дослідження на клінічній базі кафедри анестезіології та інтенсивної терапії ДЗ «Дніпропетровська медична академія МОЗ України» і на базі відділення інтенсивної терапії сепсису КП «Дніпропетровська обласна клінічна лікарня ім. І.І. Мечникова» ДОР». У дослідження було включено 22 пацієнти. У всіх хворих було проведено рутинні лабораторні дослідження для визначення рівня клінічних і біохімічних маркерів системного запалення й органних дисфункцій за шкалами SOFA і LIFE. Для оцінки стану свідомості використовували шкалу коми Глазго. Концентрацію цитокінів (фактор некрозу пухлини α, інтерлейкін-1, інтерлейкін-4, інтерферон α) у сироватці крові вивчали імуноферментним методом. Базисна інтенсивна терапія здійснювалася відповідно до основних положень «Міжнародного керівництва з інтенсивної терапії сепсису та септичного шоку: 2016» з додатковим використанням нейропротекторного препарату Гліатиліну (холіну альфосцерат) 1000–3000 мг на добу внутрішньовенно, розчиненого в 0,9% розчині натрію хлориду, протягом 5–10 днів. Дослідження показників проводилося в чотири етапи: на 1-шу, 3-тю, 5-ту, 7-му добу. Результати. Узагальнюючи результати дослідження, можливо сказати, що на п’яту й сьому добу були відсутні клінічні прояви синдрому системної запальної відповіді в понад 75 % хворих; зменшилася тяжкість стану за APACHE II на 72,5 і 74,5 % (p &lt; 0,001) і ступінь вираженості синдрому поліорганної недостатності за SOFA в 9 разів (p &lt; 0,001) відповідно до етапів дослідження. Церебральна недостатність, оцінена за шкалою коми Глазго, становила 15 балів на п’яту й сьому добу дослідження, що відповідало стану ясної свідомості в понад 75 % хворих. Зазначене спостерігалося на тлі тенденції до збалансованості активності прозапальних і протизапальних ланок цитокінової системи, про що свідчили максимальні значення фактора некрозу пухлини α та інтерферону α на п’яту добу спостереження при зниженні концентрації інтерлейкіну-1 на 55,8 % щодо фону. Прогнозована летальність у пацієнтів другої групи становила 51 %, фактична летальність — 7,5 %. Отже, шляхом проведення даного варіанта інтенсивної терапії вдалося знизити передбачувану летальність на 43,5 %.",

      "abstract": "Dizziness is one of the most common symptoms in the elderly. Various vestibular disorders, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, Meniere’s disease, vestibular migraine, can cause dizziness. The vestibular system consists of the peripheral vestibular organs in the inner ear and the extensive central nervous system from the cerebellum and brainstem to the thalamus to cortex. In particularly, vestibular sensory input plays a important role in spatial cognitive abilities such as spatial memory and spatial navigation. In the elderly, cognitive decline, such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia, is a very frightening disease that worsens the quality of life. It is possible to evaluate vestibular dysfunction through vestibular function test, and there are various evaluation methods for cognitive function. The evidence has been gradually accumulating to suggest that the balance organs or ‘vestibular system,’ might also be important in the development of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Animal studies, pathologic and imaging evidence, and behavioral assays on the relationship between various diseases related to dizziness and cognitive dysfunction are supporting that. Given that vestibular dysfunction can be treated through physical-therapy such as vestibular rehabilitation, identifying and treating dizziness in older adults with and without cognitive impairment may provide potential benefits in preventing, mitigating cognitive decline.",

Predicting the probability of successful treatment for the patient assumes that the physician has made an accurate diagnosis. In this review, the practical differential diagnosis of MG is reviewed from the perspective of conditions (at presentation of symptoms and signs) that may mimic the disorder. The differential diagnosis includes disorders that limit eye movements (with or without associated diplopia), cause false-positive laboratory studies, and mimic MG but have normal eye movements. The differential diagnosis includes disorders that affect the upper brainstem, cranial nerves, neuromuscular junction, muscles, or local orbit anatomy. Nonneurological systemic diseases (i.e., encephalopathy, sepsis) can produce fluctuating ptosis or eye movements that can occasionally be confused with MG. Although MG is considered often in the differential diagnosis of weakness or fatigue symptoms that lack a correlate on neurological examination (subjective fatigue, breakaway weakness, chronic fatigue syndrome), MG is almost never found.",

In both a group of twin volunteers and a group of patients with panic disorder/agoraphobia, the lifetime experience of more than one diagnosis of a neurotic syndrome was common but there was no evidence of patterns of co-occurrence of diagnoses being associated with particular syndromes. Receiving a diagnosis was associated with abnormal scores on measures of neuroticism and locus of control, the extent of the abnormality increasing with the number of different diagnoses satisfied. It is argued that the concept of a general neurotic syndrome depends in part on the presence of such predisposing personality factors, and that reduction in this predisposition to neurosis should be the focus of treatment.",

The results show that many of the comorbidities identified may be metabolic risk factors for the development of other diseases or may even predispose to depression, as suggested by other studies in the literature. Patients with multiple comorbidities have a much higher risk of depression, which requires the implementation of a depression screening program and monitoring of patients at risk.

      "abstract": "Subjective sleepiness is defined as \"an elemental feeling state\" by which the subject, and only him/her knows whether he/she is alert or sleepy. Subjective sleepiness has little been used for the clinical evaluation of sleepiness. Objective sleepiness is defined as a consequence of the homeostatic need for sleep. In the absence of a measurable marker of the fulfillment of the function of sleep, the evaluation of objective sleepiness has to rely on a behavioral approach based on the postulate that the more you need sleep (i.e., the sleepier you are), the more likely you are to fall asleep. However, as for many other fundamental human behaviors (drinking, eating, sexual behavior), it is likely that the sleeping behavior serves other purposes than its primary objective, which distorts the relationship between the observed sleeping behavior and the actual need for sleep. The likelihood to fall asleep can be measured by the speed with which a sleep episode occurs under standardized laboratory conditions (multiple sleep latency test, maintenance of wakefulness test, OSLER test), or by the frequency of unwanted sleep episodes under the more naturalistic conditions of daily life (Epworth Sleepiness Scale). These various approaches have advantages and drawbacks, but none of them can be considered the \"gold standard\".",

Le debut partiel est quasi systematique chez le sujet âge mais des crises de toutes sortes, voire plus souvent generalisees sont observees chez le patient dement. Faire un diagnostic d'epilepsie et typer une crise, dans cette population, reste un exercice difficile et se heurte a plusieurs obstacles : l'interrogatoire n'est pas fiable, l'absence de temoin est frequente, la clinique est extremement variee, conduisant a passer a cote de nombreuses crises. Ces dernieres peuvent etre prises pour des problemes d'autres origines, notamment cardiaques, ou pour des symptomes de la demence sous-jacente et vice-versa. Le pourcentage important de crises liees a une situation pathologique, telle qu'un accident vasculaire cerebral a la phase aigue ou la survenue de troubles metaboliques ou toxiques, impose de realiser un bilan etiologique, pour rechercher un facteur intercurrent permettant alors de classer l'evenement en crise symptomatique. Ce n'est pas tant la frequence des crises qui pose probleme generalement, que les consequences medico-sociales nefastes. A moins d'etre en presence d'une crise symptomatique (liee a une cause identifiable) et surtout si la crise se repete au moins une fois, le traitement est conseille.

Some NMS may antedate the diagnosis of PD. Examples of NMS include cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, visual dysfunction, sleep abnormalities, and psychiatric disorders. NMS are associated with wide-ranging abnormalities in extranigral dopaminergic systems and non-dopaminergic (e.g. cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic) systems. The type and severity of NMS vary based on age, disease severity, and predominant motor symptoms. NMS can be disabling and reduce quality of life. Treatment of NMS can be challenging. Some NMS are helped by dopaminergic treatment, whereas others can be induced or exacerbated by treatments that help the motor dysfunction. Physicians should probe their PD patients about their NMS and address them for better care. Clinical trials should incorporate NMS as outcomes for more meaningful conclusions on the effect of treatments under investigation.",

      "abstract": "Functional weakness and sensory loss are common clinical problems with variable presentations. Functional weakness commonly presents as weakness of an entire limb, paraparesis, or hemiparesis, with observable or demonstrable inconsistencies and nonanatomic accompaniments. Documentation of limb movements during sleep, the arm drop test, the Babinski thigh-trunk test, Hoover tests, the Sonoo abductor test, and various dynamometer tests can provide useful bedside diagnostic information on functional weakness. Functional sensory loss typically affects all sensory modalities, either in a hemisensory distribution or affecting an entire limb. Although often inconsistent over serial examinations with nonanatomic features, many clinical findings reported to be helpful in diagnosing functional sensory loss are neither sensitive nor specific for functional sensory loss. The yes-no test, Bowlus-Currier test, and forced-choice tests can provide useful bedside diagnostic information on functional sensory loss. Clinicians must be prepared to make more than one diagnosis in some cases, including an organic neurological diagnosis and a diagnosis of functional overlay. Recent studies have reported relatively low rates (<5%) of misdiagnosis of functional weakness or sensory loss as indicated by subsequent diagnosis of neurological or psychiatric conditions that explained the presenting symptoms. Most neurologists find such patients more difficult to help than patients with organic disease. Management focuses on supportive psychotherapy and behavioral management, exploration of social and psychological issues, treatment of comorbid depression or anxiety, and facilitation of development of more appropriate and constructive coping methods. Many patients with functional weakness, and to a somewhat lesser extent functional sensory loss, have persisting or relapsing-remitting somatic symptoms and persistently impaired social/interpersonal, occupational, and psychological functioning.",

Gejala bervariasi tergantung pada bagian otak atau sistem saraf yang terpengaruh, terjadi pada berbagai rentang usia, mulai dari bayi hingga usia dewasa. GBS, penyakit sistem saraf tepi, dapat muncul pada berbagai kelompok usia dan disebabkan oleh peradangan yang merusak lapisan mielin saraf pada motor neuron serta melibatkan kelainan autoimun pada beberapa individu yang terkena. Infeksi terkait GBS dapat disebabkan oleh bakteri Campylobacter pylori yang dapat dideteksi melalui pemeriksaan laboratorium. Meskipun sangat langka, hanya sekitar 1 dari 100.000 orang yang mengalami gangguan sistem saraf akibat penyakit ini. Gejala GBS mencakup kram otot, parestesia, kesulitan menelan, kesulitan bernafas, kehilangan respons motorik, peningkatan denyut nadi, gangguan pencernaan, kelebihan keringat, dan ketidakstabilan tekanan darah. Untuk memfasilitasi diagnosa penyakit ini, disarankan penggunaan sistem pakar yang dapat memberikan keputusan melalui analisis masalah dengan menerapkan metode atau algoritma tertentu, termasuk algoritma certainty factor. Hal ini diharapkan dapat meningkatkan efisiensi dan objektivitas dalam proses diagnosa penyakit GBS tanpa memerlukan pertemuan langsung antara dokter dan pasien. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengidentifikasi jenis penyakit berdasarkan gejala atau keluhan pasien melalui penerapan certainty factor. Hasil diagnosa menunjukkan persentase tingkat keyakinan sebesar 99.7%, memberikan kontribusi dalam penyediaan diagnosis yang cepat, efisien, dan objektif, mengurangi ketergantungan pada pertemuan langsung antara dokter atau pakar dengan pasien.",

      "title": "Prevalence and clinical specificity of fatigue symptoms in chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis",
      "abstract": "This article provides a critical review of the psychological and related literature on fatigue resulting in both mental and physical experiences. On one hand, prolonged severe fatigue is a prominent disabling symptom in various diseases of different aetiology – psychiatric (e.g. depression), somatic (e.g. some infections) and neurologic (e.g. multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis). For instance, fatigue is a main symptom of myasthenia that leads to pathological skeletal muscle weakness. Furthermore, 40 to 90 per cent of individuals suffering from multiple sclerosis confirm they have experienced fatigue, which impairs their cognitive functioning. In both multiple sclerosis and myasthenia, fatigue has not only a physical but also a psychological dimension. On the other hand, fatigue can be seen as an isolated set of symptoms of unknown origin called the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The development of the concept, diagnostic criteria and some strategies of coping with CFS are presented. Various somatic disorders, as well as subjective cognitive and emotional complaints, are common and well documented in patients with CFS. The most typical include depression, as well as problems with concentration of attention, decision-making and reasoning in complex situations. However, general intellectual abilities and higher order cognitive skills are intact. Directions for future research are outlined.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "title": "People presenting with physical disorder",
      "abstract": "All healthcare professionals dealing primarily with physical disorder need a working knowledge of relevant psychological factors and psychiatric dis­orders. Despite the geographical and, often, cul­tural separation of most ‘general’ (i.e. physical) and psychiatric hospitals, there are close links (1) be­tween physical and psychological disorders, and (2) between physical and psychological factors in the aetiology, presentation, and management of all illness. This chapter aims to stimulate you to think about these issues in primary care and in the general hospital, and to equip you with the know­ledge required to think about them in an integrated, biopsychosocial way. The links between physical and psychological fac­tors are multiple. They include: … ● psychiatric and physical disorders occurring together by chance— as they are both common; ● psychiatric disorders causing physical symptoms— for example, depression is associated with low physical energy (anergia), amenorrhoea, and constipation; ● psychiatric disorder adversely affecting the outcome of physical disorder— for example, a depressive disorder might impair self- management of diabetes mellitus, because low motivation is a common symptom of depression, and may reduce adherence to self- monitoring of glucose; ● psychological factors increasing disability associated with physical disorder— for example, if a patient recovering from a myocardial infarction believes that it has led to a permanent reduction in their cardiac function, they are less likely to return to work, to take regular exercise, and to have a normal sex life; ● untreated psychological problems leading to the inappropriate use of medical resources and to poor compliance with medical advice— for example, people with panic disorder are more likely to attend emergency departments with acute ‘cardiac’ symptoms; ● physical symptoms and disorders having psychological consequences, which include psychiatric disorder— for example, hypothyroidism and cerebrovascular disease may lead to depression; ● physical disorder exacerbating unrelated psychiatric symptoms— for example, a viral infection could delay recovery from a depressive disorder, by impairing the person’s usual activities, at work and at home, which would otherwise provide therapeutic distraction and stimulation.",

      "abstract": "Memory loss commonly occurs as a result of the loss of nerve cells in the brain. When memory loss is so severe that it interferes with normal daily functioning, it is called dementia. People with dementia may have difficulty learning new things or remembering names of people they just met. They may get lost in places that were previously very familiar or have trouble finding words. The term “mild cognitive impairment” is used for a common condition in elderly people in which the memory problem is usually mild and does not interfere with normal daily activities. Most people with mild cognitive impairment do not develop a severe memory problem or end up developing dementia. There are many things that can cause dementia. One of these is Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Another is called vascular dementia, caused by brain damage due to strokes. More information about causes of dementia can be found on the next page.\n\nIn this issue of Neurology , O’Brien and colleagues report the results of a study in elderly people evaluating the risk of developing dementia after a person has had a stroke (Gamaldo A, Moghekar A, Kilada S, Resnick SM, Zonderman AB, O’Brien R.

There is circumstantial evidence that this is also true in humans. Since a reduced ability to experience pleasure or reward (i.e. anhedonia) is a cardinal feature of clinical depression, and since the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine projections have been shown to degenerate in Parkinson’s disease, it is suggested that damage to these reward-related systems may contribute directly to the high incidence of depression that has been reported in this disease.",

      "abstract": "Neurosyphilis presents a significant diagnostic challenge in psychiatric settings due to its highly variable neuropsychiatric manifestations, which can mimic a range of other psychiatric disorders. This case report describes a 36-year-old male admitted with acute psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior. His clinical history revealed previously treated syphilis, with no subsequent follow-up, and recent progressive cognitive and behavioral changes, ultimately leading to a diagnosis of neurosyphilis (specifically general paresis) following serological confirmation. This case highlights the complexities in diagnosing neurosyphilis, as its symptoms often overlap with common psychiatric conditions, making it easy to overlook in routine assessments. Importantly, the diagnosis required a high index of suspicion due to the patient’s psychiatric presentation combined with a background of untreated syphilis. Considering neurosyphilis in the differential diagnosis can be challenging, especially when psychiatric symptoms like depression, cognitive decline, and psychosis appear in the absence of clear neurological signs and when there is no follow-up on prior infections. The resurgence of syphilis and its neurological complications remains a concern, particularly in psychiatric populations where risk factors such as substance use disorders, socioeconomic challenges, and limited access to healthcare are prevalent. This case underscores the critical role of psychiatrists in screening for syphilis, especially in patients at risk or in areas with high syphilis prevalence. Early and accurate diagnosis, coupled with appropriate treatment using penicillin, can halt disease progression and mitigate severe neuropsychiatric outcomes. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis in psychiatric patients and considering neurosyphilis in cases of unexplained psychiatric symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many neurologic symptoms may appear without organic lesions of the nervous system. Based on the underlying mechanisms, psychogenic (or functional) neurologic diseases are classified into three categories: conversion disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering. Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

      "abstract": "The extent and consequences of medical comorbidity in patients with schizophrenia are generally underrecognized. Patients with comorbid conditions are usually excluded from research studies, although they probably represent the majority of individuals with schizophrenia. Elderly patients are especially likely to have comorbid disorders. In this article, we review selected literature on medical comorbidity in schizophrenia, including physical illnesses, substance use, cognitive impairment, sensory deficits, and iatrogenic comorbidity. Data from the University of California, San Diego Clinical Research Center on late-life psychosis are also presented. Older schizophrenia patients report fewer comorbid physical illnesses than healthy comparison subjects, but their illnesses tend to be more severe. These results suggest that schizophrenia patients may receive less than adequate health care. Substance abuse is more common in patients with schizophrenia than in the general population and may exacerbate psychiatric symptoms in these patients. Although generalized cognitive impairment is associated with schizophrenia, the main contributors to dementia in older patients are more likely to be comorbid neurological and other physical disorders, substance abuse, and medication side effects. Iatrogenic comorbidity results primarily from the use of neuroleptic (e.g., tardive dyskinesia) and anticholinergic (e.g., confusion) medications. Clinical and research recommendations are made for management of comorbidity in schizophrenia.",

The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

Deux elements y concourent : la difficile appreciation des fluctuations cognitives, elements cles du diagnostic, et de la faible frequence de conjonction des trois criteres principaux qui semble liee a la presence d’une pathologie de type Alzheimer associee. Les criteres proposes pour un diagnostic de DCL probable sont : 1) la presence des trois signes majeurs : fluctuations cognitives avec des variations prononcees de l’attention et de la vigilance ; hallucinations visuelles recurrentes et detaillees ; presence de signes parkinsoniens spontanes ; 2) la presence de 1 ou plus des signes majeurs s’il existe 1 ou plus signes suggestifs. Le diagnostic de DCL possible peut etre porte chez un sujet dement, en l’absence de signes majeurs, devant 1 ou plus des signes suggestifs suivants : 1) troubles du sommeil paradoxal que traduit une agitation nocturne (les patients « agissent leurs reves ») ; 2) severe sensibilite aux neuroleptiques ; 3) mise en evidence d’un deficit dopaminergique dans les noyaux gris par la tomoscinigraphie. D’autres signes sont communs mais manquent de specificite : 1) signes de dysautonomie : hypotension orthostatique, chutes ou syncopes, instabilite neurocardiovasculaire, incontinence urinaire, impuissance, constipation ; 2) delire systematise ; 3) hallucinations autres que visuelles ; 4) depression ; 5) relative preservation des structures temporales internes en IRM ; 6) ralentissement diffus a l’EEG ; 7) hypoperfusion cerebrale generalisee, notamment dans les regions occipitales. Au plan neuropsychologique, la differenciation avec la MA repose sur une double dissociation : dans la DCL, la preservation relative de la denomination, du rappel a court et moyen terme comme de la reconnaissance contraste avec l’alteration de la fluence verbale, de la perception visuelle et des performances visuospatiales. Pour diminuer les difficultes d’appreciation des fluctuations, les auteurs recommandent d’utiliser les echelles de fluctuations cognitives proposees par Walker et al. [2] (la Clinician assessment of fluctuation scale necessite toutefois une plus grande expertise que la One day fluctuation assessement scale) ou la Mayo fluctuations composite scale pour differencier les fluctuations de la DCL de celles qui sont observees dans la MA [3]. Les criteres histopathologiques sont precises, notamment la quantification des lesions de type Alzheimer. L’article se conclut sur l’interet d’un traitement combine par les inhibiteurs de la cholinesterase et les dopaminergiques [4]. Quant a la question des rapports entre demence parkinsonienne (definie par l’apparition d’une demence chez un parkinsonien de longue date) et la DC (dans laquelle les signes parkinsoniens ne doivent pas avoir precede la demence de plus de 1 an), le consortium considere que cette distinction doit etre maintenue pour des raisons cliniques, mais qu’au niveau de la recherche, clinicopathologique ou therapeutique, les deux phenotypes peuvent etre reunis sous le terme de maladie a corps de Lewy ou alpha-synucleinopathie ! 1. McKeith IG, Dickson DW, Lowe J, Emre M, O’Brien JT, Feldman H, et al.

      "title": "Medication Noncompliance and Criminal Responsibility: Is the Insanity Defense Legitimate?",
      "abstract": "Noncompliance with medication therapy and mental health care is prevalent among the mentally ill. Its multifactorial dynamics can include aspects of the illness itself, such as anosognosia. Noncompliance with medication can increase risk of violent or other criminal behavior, but the law currently does not recognize it as a factor in determining culpability.

      "abstract": "Noncompliance with medication therapy and mental health care is prevalent among the mentally ill. Its multifactorial dynamics can include aspects of the illness itself, such as anosognosia. Noncompliance with medication can increase risk of violent or other criminal behavior, but the law currently does not recognize it as a factor in determining culpability. The legal test of insanity that focuses on a “defect of reason from disease of the mind” presumes that the disease was not self-induced.

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Kognitive Beeinträchtigungen treten bei etwa jedem zweiten MS-Betroffenen unabhängig von der Verlaufsform auf. Sie zeigen weder Linearität zum körperlichen Beeinträchtigungsgrad gemessen mittels Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), noch gibt es eine direkte Relation zur Erkrankungsdauer. Kognitive Defizite können bereits früh im Krankheitsgeschehen, beispielsweise bei einem Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) oder Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) auftreten und werden auch bei Patienten mit einem benignen Verlauf beobachtet. Obgleich die Progression als eher moderat betrachtet werden kann, wirken sich kognitive Einbußen in beinahe jedem Stadium stark negativ auf die Lebensqualität und die Therapieadhärenz aus. Diagnostisch sind wir in der Lage mittels sensitiver Screeninginstrumente diejenigen kognitiven Teilfunktionen zu erfassen, die bei MS-Patienten am häufigsten beeinträchtigt sind. Wie so häufig in der Medizin hinkt jedoch die Therapie dem Fortschritt bei der Diagnostik hinterher, sodass wir keine zuverlässige evidenzbasierte symptomatische Therapie zur Behandlung kognitiver Defizite bei MS zur Verfügung haben. Derzeit sind nonpharmakologische Ansätze, mit dem Ziel die kognitive Reserve des Gehirns zu stärken, Erfolg versprechend. Methodisch saubere Wirksamkeitsstudien stehen allerdings noch aus.",

      "title": "Neurobiology of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders",
      "abstract": "The schizophrenia spectrum disorders are a group of psychiatric diagnoses that share several clinical features, typically involving reality distortion. Each is considered a disorder, diagnosed with a distinct set of diagnostic criteria. Spectrum conveys the idea that they are somehow similar to each other. Such similarity could be defined on purely clinical grounds or at the level of disease mechanism and aetiology. It is this tension of distinctiveness and similarity that makes the scientific study of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders challenging. The concept of the schizophrenia spectrum can be traced back to Bleuler and his book Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias. 1 The schizophrenias are characterised by significant heterogeneity of signs and symptoms, disease course and outcome. This gives rise to various clinical subtypes and to variants defined by a shorter duration of illness. Most importantly, the outcome of the schizophrenias ranges from long-term disability to",

      "title": "Acute psychotic symptoms caused by overlapping central nervous system pathologies: a case report",
      "abstract": "Background: In some medical cases, psychotic symptoms can be part of the clinical picture, and sometimes it can even be the only clinical appearance of the medical condition. Psychotic disorders secondary to organic pathologies affecting the central nervous system are called psychotic disorders due to a general medical condition. While some of these secondary causes can easily be detected by laboratory and imaging methods, anamnesis or neurological examination (substance use, trauma, and tumors), others are often overlooked in the presence of rare medical conditions (autoimmune disease and viral encephalitis), when laboratory and examination findings are not clear and psychiatric symptoms are in the foreground. Case Presentation: In this case, we tried to reveal the differential diagnosis and treatment processes of a patient who was admitted to the emergency department with psychotic symptoms, such as agitation, aggression, and paranoid delusions, and was admitted to the psychiatry clinic after an urgent medical evaluation. After his admission to the psychiatry clinic, the medical evaluation of the patient was re-evaluated in detail due to memory and orientation deterioration, and as a result, clinical pictures such as Hashimoto’s encephalopathy, herpes encephalitis, and epileptic seizures were found to be together in the patient. As a matter of fact, both general medical and psychiatric statuses of the patient improved with the application of low doses and short-term antipsychotic treatment for psychiatric symptoms together with the treatment for this underlying general medical condition. Conclusion: Since the treatment of psychiatric symptoms caused by secondary medical factors is quite different from the treatment of primary psychiatric disorders, it is important to make full medical evaluations, especially in patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms for the first time or presenting with emergency psychiatric symptoms.",

In many cases, an accurate estimation of the respective part of neurobiological abnormalities, adjustment disorders, disability and narcissistic wounds related to the disease appears very difficult for the practitioner. Specific data on the therapeutical aspects of secondary depressive disorders remains quite scarce.

Recognition of these clues will allow referral, as necessary, for further investigation or surveillance.

      "title": "Clinical Assessment of Cervical Myelopathy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Myelopathy literally indicates any pathology of the spinal cord, but the term most commonly is used when the cord pathology results from degenerative disease. Specific names usually are used if the disorder is traumatic (spinal cord injury), infectious (myelitis), or neoplastic (the name of the tumor is used). Cervical myelopathy (CM) may result in symptoms such as clumsiness, loss of dexterity, imbalance or poor coordination; muscle weakness; pain; and, in severe cases, bowel, bladder, or sexual dysfunction. When impairment is rated, if the evaluator finds objective evidence of myelopathy when the individual is at maximum medical improvement, neurological impairment is combined with that for the spine. A detailed and thorough neurologic examination is the current standard for the diagnosis of CM, but diagnosis is challenging in the early stages. Correlation of patient symptoms and imaging studies, both plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging scans, is essential for correct diagnosis. When imaging studies are equivocal or insensitive, other studies such as electrodiagnostic testing and cerebrospinal fluid analysis may be considered. When CM is defined as the presence of more than one long-tract sign, spinal cord compression in isolation did not cause myelopathy, and up to 20% of those with cord compression did not exhibit CM.",

Die Pathogenese ist letztendlich unbekannt; wahrscheinlich handelt es sich um ein Syndrom mit verschiedenen Ursachen. Sekundäre Mechanismen wie Schlafstörungen, eine Anämie oder eine Schilddrüsenfunktionsstörung, aber auch Depressionen und kognitive Störungen müssen von der Fatigue im engeren Sinn (primäre Fatigue) abgegrenzt werden. Die subjektive Dimension der Fatigue kann mit standardisierten Fragebogen erfasst werden. Da sich zumindest ein Teil der Symptomatik mit einer Aufmerksamkeitsstörung erklärt lässt, kann mittlerweile die Fatigue mit einer Aufmerksamkeitstestung (Subtest „Alertness” aus der Testbatterie zur Aufmerksamkeitsprüfung) objektiviert werden. Die medikamentöse Therapie mit z. B. Amantadin oder Modafinil stellt in Einzelfällen eine Option dar, ist aber oftmals nicht bzw. nicht anhaltend erfolgreich.

      "title": "Stress and cognition",
      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

      "abstract": "Constipation is a frequent complaint among patients with different neurological diseases. This review provides a brief account of the numerous conditions affecting the central, peripheral and intrinsic (enteric) nervous systems in which constipation can be the only clinical manifestation or a component of a complex syndrome. Recent neuropathophysiological acquisitions show that any structural or functional impairment of the intrinsic innervation of the gut, including both developmental (i.e., Hirschsprung's disease and intestinal neuronal dysplasia) and acquired (i.e., either degenerative or inflammatory neuropathies) disorders, can be associated with constipation. Constipation may also arise from derangements of the peripheral nervous system, including diabetes and primary chronic autonomic failure (pandysautonomias). Finally, in the central nervous system, a wide array of disorders (post-traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic) are recognized to determine bowel dysfunction, ultimately leading to constipation. Further understanding of the fine pathophysiological mechanisms through which the intrinsic and extrinsic nerve supplies to the digestive system are involved in idiopathic constipation or in diseases generating this symptom will hopefully lead to a better treatment of this frequent pathological condition.",

Prevalence of \"reversible dementias\" varies between 1 and 40 %. Being potentially reversible, it remains essential to investigate and treat potentially reversible causes of dementia or dementia-like symptoms. High level of clinical suspicion is necessary to recognize these conditions. Therefore, an extensive list of potentially reversible conditions that may either cause or mimic dementia is reviewed, and their neuropsychiatric aspects described. Diagnosis is made by thorough history, neurological and physical examination combined with certain routine tests, and, occasionally, other selective investigations.

Clinical signs of encephalopathy in the uraemic patient often overlap with several other affections causing neurological disorders. Whenever basal ganglia are anatomically involved, movement disorders arise, including chorea. Some acute and chronic neurological syndromes associated with chronic uraemia have consistently been reported (uraemic encephalopathy, dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, dialysis dementia, nephroangiosclerosis neuropathy and ageing neuropathy). Other clinical conditions in which neurological involvement exists are not so frequent in both haemodialysis patients and in the general population (Wernicke's encefalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease). Because of the non specific symptoms and the very heterogeneous aetiology, a careful physical examination should be performed in haemodialysis patients with clinical signs of encephalopathy and the main metabolic alterations should be sought; moreover, central nervous system imaging examination is often appropriate. In case of basal ganglia anatomical involvement, supported by findings of imaging techniques, it is necessary to evaluate individual causes of encephalopathy by means of more accurate tests including analysis of cerebro-spinal fluid, measurement of plasma levels of vitamin B components and laboratory tests searching for more uncommon diseases such as Huntington's chorea and Wilson's disease.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric diagnostic constructs produce highly variable clinical pictures in patients. Amongst the reasons for this are high rates of co-occurrence of different diagnostic constructs, which themselves are often polythetic in nature. People who meet criteria for a diagnostic construct may have little or even no clinical features in common. These diagnostic constructs rely on people meeting the diagnostic criteria having similar qualities to their condition such as similar likelihoods of outcomes/responses to treatments. These highly variable clinical pictures are seen even when clear disease is involved, such as the dementias. General medical diagnostic constructs can also display highly variable clinical pictures even when clear disease processes have been identified. Polythetic diagnostic criteria decided upon by expert committees are also used for general medical diagnostic constructs which can also result in people meeting the same diagnostic criteria having little in common in their clinical pictures. Co-occurrence is also common in general medicine. Psychological formulation does not have to address the issue of variable clinical pictures. Both symptom-based and dimensional classifications can depict variable clinical pictures more accurately than diagnostic constructs but there are pragmatic issues such as suitability for brief appointments or emergency work.",

      "abstract": "En la practica clinica diaria es muy importante identificar todos los factores anadidos que pueden modificar los rendimientos intelectuales de los pacientes que consultan por quejas u olvidos en su memoria. Estos cambios cognitivos pueden ser debidos a multiples factores sin necesidad de que exista un proceso degenerativo que los origine: las enfermedades cerebrovasculares, las patologias generales con repercusion cerebral, tanto en estadio clinico como (hipertension, diabetes, endocrinopatias, farmacos, infecciones, traumatismos, etc), la depresion, la falta de motivacion, el aislamiento social y otras patologias psiquiatricas, ademas de diversas limitaciones sensoriales y motoras.\nLa influencia de la funcion tiroidea en la cognicion parece interesante y desde el punto de vista clinico relevante, debido a que de forma tradicional las alteraciones tiroideas se han incluido como una causa secundaria y reversible tanto de problemas en la cognicion como en el estado de animo. Con relativa frecuencia se detecta la presencia de en el estudio analitico de extension que habitualmente se realiza a los pacientes que consultan por quejas subjetivas de memoria. El termino designa una situacion en la que un paciente asintomatico tiene una fraccion libre de T4 en el limite bajo de la normalidad pero con un nivel elevado de TSH. Una serie de evidencias crecientes, tambien relacionan al hipotiroidismo subclinico con alteraciones en el area cognitiva y en el area de la conducta. Pero la cuestion sobre si los pacientes con presentan sintomas y si los posibles sintomas son reversibles con terapia hormonal, continua siendo en la actualidad un tema de debate muy controvertido y con muchas dudas por resolver.\nLos objetivos de nuestro estudio pretenden comprobar mediante una bateria de test neuropsicologicos dos cuestiones principales. En primer lugar, si la presencia de en un grupo de pacientes establece a nivel cognitivo diferencias clinicamente relevantes frente a un grupo de individuos control. En segundo lugar, si la presencia de en un grupo de pacientes determina la presencia de un mayor numero de cuadros depresivos frente a un grupo de individuos control.\n Se seleccionan pacientes consecutivos evaluados de forma ambulatoria y diagnosticados previamente de subclinico. En funcion de la edad, sexo y nivel educativo de los pacientes, se seleccionan de forma dirigida un grupo de sujetos para utilizarlo como grupo control. Los grupos seleccionados son homogeneos, en cuanto a la variable edad, sexo y nivel educativo. Se realiza una primera evaluacion analitica basal de los niveles sericos de TSH, T4L y anticuerpos antitiroideos, para posteriormente realizar una analitica de control a los seis meses. Se realiza una evaluacion neuropsicologica en la visita basal y una reevaluacion de control a los seis meses. Despues de la visita basal se administran suplementos de hormona tiroidea (L-tiroxina), segun los criterios establecidos por el endocrinologo responsable del seguimiento clinico de los pacientes.\nEl estudio agrupa a un total de 60 sujetos. En el grupo control se incluyen a 23 individuos eutiroideos y en el grupo de pacientes 37 sujetos diagnosticados de subclinico. En el 22,41% de los pacientes se detectan anticuerpos positivos. Solo 8 pacientes presentan niveles de TSH iguales o superiores a 10 mU/L. Los pacientes incluidos en el estudio no presentan mayor numero de quejas subjetivas de memoria que los pacientes del grupo control. El tiempo de ejecucion del Test del Trazo es superior en los pacientes con (p 0,04), y frente a los pacientes con un nivel de TSH inferior a 10mU/L (p<0,04). Los pacientes con anticuerpos antitiroideos positivos describen un mayor numero de quejas u olvidos que los individuos del grupo control (p<0,02), y que los pacientes con anticuerpos negativos (p<0,007). La puntuacion en el Test de Evocacion Categorial fue significativamente inferior en los pacientes con anticuerpos antitiroideos frente a los pacientes con anticuerpos negativos (p<0,0515) y tambien frente al grupo de individuos control (p<0,008). Los pacientes que finalizan el estudio y mantienen criterios analiticos de pero niveles de TSH<10mU/L, no presentan mayor numero de quejas subjetivas de memoria, ni alteraciones cognitivas relevantes que la poblacion control. Estos resultados no estan influenciados por la presencia de un mayor numero de cuadros depresivos.\nLa instauracion del tratamiento sustitutivo, mejora significativamente la puntuacion de los test que evaluan funciones de memoria (como la figura de Rey diferida) y los test que evaluan atencion y concentracion (como el test de los digitos). Los pacientes con que mantienen el mismo estatus tiroideo al finalizar el estudio (niveles de TSH inferiores a 10 mU/L) no presentan a nivel cognitivo diferencias clinicamente relevantes con respecto a los individuos del grupo control, ni un riesgo incrementado de desarrollar un establecido al finalizar el estudio.\nEn conclusion y aunque los pacientes diagnosticados de no describen de forma subjetiva un mayor numero de quejas o problemas de memoria que los individuos del grupo control, se constata que estos pacientes si que presentan alteraciones en los test que evaluan las funciones de atencion-ejecucion, memoria diferida y atencion-concentracion. Las puntuaciones obtenidas en el Test de depresion de Yesavage no detectan la presencia de un mayor numero de cuadros depresivos en los pacientes con hipotiroismo subclinico. El seguimiento a largo plazo de los pacientes que presentan hipotirodismo con niveles de TSH<10mU/L, no detecta alteraciones cognitivas relevantes.",

      "abstract": "La capacite a se souvenir d'effectuer une action qu'on avait prevu accomplir dans le futur, nommee la memoire prospective (MP), est sollicitee quotidiennement. En clinique, les perturbations de la MP sont parmi les premieres plaintes cognitives frequemment rapportees par les personnes âgees et leurs proches qui craignent les consequences deleteres qu'elles peuvent engendrer sur le maintien de l'autonomie fonctionnelle. La majorite des travaux portant sur l'effet du vieillissement normal sur la MP met en evidence une atteinte objective precoce qui se voit exacerbee par le vieillissement pathologique, tel qu'observe chez les personnes âgees en phase preclinique et clinique de la demence, comme le trouble cognitif leger (TCL) et la maladie d'Alzheimer (MA), respectivement. Toutefois, on possede peu d'informations quant a son integrite dans d'autres populations cliniques a risque de developper une maladie neurodegenerative, notamment dans le trouble cognitif leger non amnesique (TCLna) et le trouble comportemental en sommeil paradoxal idiopathique (TCSPi). Ce travail doctoral vise donc a caracteriser plus amplement la performance de la MP chez des patients atteints de differents sous-types de TCL, en s'interessant plus particulierement a celle observee dans les cas presentant un TCSPi. La premiere etude comprend deux objectifs principaux, soit (1) de comparer la performance entre differents profils cognitifs lies au vieillissement normal et pathologique (TCL, MA) sur la tâche de l'enveloppe et (2) d'investiguer la valeur discriminante de celle-ci pour des fins d'utilisation clinique. L'echantillon se compose de 49 temoins, de 41 patients MA et de 64 individus TCL amnesique et non amnesique d'etiologies mixtes (idiopathique, n = 17; TCSPi, n = 20; maladie de Parkinson, n = 27). Les resultats mettent en evidence un gradient d'atteintes de la MP, avec les patients MA presentant des difficultes significatives dans les composantes prospective et retrospective de la tâche, suivi des individus TCLa ayant un patron similaire, mais moins severe que les patients MA et enfin les individus TCLna manifestant une difficulte isolee dans la composante retrospective. La correlation elevee entre la performance a la tâche de l'enveloppe et le fonctionnement mnesique suggere que les individus presentant une memoire episodique retrospective limitee sont plus vulnerables a l'echec. Par ailleurs, les analyses revelent que la tâche de l'enveloppe est tres sensible et specifique pour discriminer les patients MA des temoins alors qu'elle s'avere peu sensible (mais tres specifique) chez les TCLa et les TCLna. Dans l'ensemble, l'etude suggere la presence de patrons distincts pour chacun des sous-types de TCL et fournit des donnees interessantes pour promouvoir l'utilisation de cette epreuve par les cliniciens desirant rapidement evaluer la MP dans leur pratique. Depuis quelques annees, il y a un interet accru a identifier des marqueurs predictifs de neurodegenerescence, notamment dans les synucleinopathies, comme la maladie de Parkinson (PD) et la demence a corps de Lewy (DCL). Le declin cognitif associe au TCL et au TCSPi sont parmi les facteurs de risque importants pour le developpement de ces maladies neurodegeneratives. A notre connaissance, les seuls travaux anterieurs a examiner le trouble de la MP dans les synucleinopathies ont ete effectues chez des patients avec une PD sans demence (avec ou sans TCL), d'ou l'interet d'etudier plus precisement le fonctionnement de la MP dans le TCSPi. Dans la deuxieme etude, 38 individus TCSPi, dont 25 sans TCL (TCSPi-nTCL) et 13 avec TCL (TCSPi-TCL), sont compares a 20 temoins sur trois epreuves evaluant la MP : un questionnaire d'autoevaluation, la tâche de l'enveloppe et une epreuve experimentale de saillance. Les resultats ne montrent aucune difference significative entre les trois groupes quant aux plaintes autorapportees et a la performance sur la tâche de l'enveloppe. Toutefois, l'epreuve experimentale a mis en evidence un trouble de la MP dans le TCSPi, caracterise par des difficultes a detecter des indices prospectifs saillants et non saillants comparativement aux temoins. Seule la condition non saillante permet de differencier la performance entre les TCSPi-nTCL et les TCSPi-TCL, ce qui semble attribuable a une dysfonction executive plus marquee chez ces derniers. En depit de ses limites, ce projet doctoral apporte une comprehension plus eclairee sur des themes de recherche negliges par la communaute scientifique. La premiere etude fournit des preuves assez robustes concernant l'utilisation de la tâche de l'enveloppe dans la MA alors qu'elle devrait etre probablement accompagnee d'autres epreuves cliniques dans le TCL. La deuxieme etude stimule l'interet d'explorer davantage la nature des deficits de la MP dans le TCSPi afin d'accumuler des preuves convaincantes en vue de les considerer comme un nouveau marqueur predictif du processus neurodegeneratif.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : memoire prospective, trouble cognitif leger, maladie d'Alzheimer, trouble comportemental en sommeil paradoxal, fonctions executives",

NREM sleep is further divided into three stages: N1, N2, and N3, corresponding to NREM stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 plus 4 of the Rechtschaffen and Kales classification, respectively. In the REM stage, the EEG is similar to the waking EEG, but it is characterized by the occurrence of rapid eye movements and a decrease or loss of muscle discharge in the jaw muscles. The subject usually dreams during REM sleep. The mechanism of sleep stages has been extensively investigated physiologically as well as pharmacologically.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common occurrence in the United States, with an estimated incidence exceeding 1 million injuries per year. Cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physical impairments are common sequelae of TBI and may, in a significant minority of patients, persist well into the late period following injury. The etiology of these symptoms in individuals with mild TBI is controversial, with hypotheses of postconcussive symptom formation variously ascribing greater or lesser weight to neural damage, pre- and/or post-injury psychological or psychiatric factors, somatization, malingering, or some combination of these. Some of these hypotheses reflect biases common to medicolegal or compensation-related contexts, whereas others are derived from recent neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies. Studies of the latter sort suggest that many of the typical postconcussive symptoms are associated with neurobiological dysfunction in one or more areas of the central nervous system. Whether these symptoms constitute a postconcussive syndrome per se is debatable. Instead, it may be more accurate to describe them as commonly co-occurring symptoms rather than as a syndromal sequela of TBI. The present review addresses these issues including the epidemiology and course of recovery from mild TBI and the validity of the postconcussive syndrome. Suggestions regarding the assessment and treatment of individuals with post-concussive symptoms are offered.",

Severe illness in the newborn, regardless of the underlying cause, tends to manifest itself in a rather stereotypic way with relatively nonspecific findings, such as poor feeding, drowsiness, lethargy, hypotonia, and failure to thrive. Because inherited metabolic diseases are individually rare, clinicians have a tendency to pursue the possibility only after other more common conditions, such as sepsis, have been excluded. Further delay often occurs because the type of investigation required to make the diagnosis of inherited metabolic disease includes unfamiliar tests, which the clinician may feel uncomfortable interpreting owing to a general lack of confidence regarding metabolic problems.",

La evaluacion y el manejo de los trastornos de la alimentacion van dirigidos hacia las caracteristicas clinicas, nutricionales y psicologicas de la enfermedad. Debe ser llevado a cabo por un equipo multidisciplinario, puesto que las manifestaciones que llevan a consultar al paciente o a su familiar pueden venir del terreno biologico o del comportamental. Frecuentemente se produce un importante retraso entre la aparicion de los sintomas y la instauracion del tratamiento. Los trastornos de conducta alimentaria (TCA) pueden pasar desapercibidos hasta en el 50% de los casos.",

In ditartikel worden enkel de ulceraties van devoetzool besproken waarvan men vermoedtdat de neuropathie de voornaamste patho-genetische factor is. Dergelijke ulceraties wordenmalum perforans genoemd. Ulceraties van devoet vormen een ingangspoort voor bacterie¨leinfecties. Deze kunnen resulteren in een ernstigewekedeleninfectie of in een aantasting van hetbot: osteomyelitis.De osteoartropathie is een specifieke ver-wikkeling, die eveneens het gevolg is van deneuropathie.PathogeneseHet plantaire voetulcus ontwikkelt zichhoogstwaarschijnlijk onder invloed van meer-dere factoren. De drie voornaamste zijn neuro-pathie, een mechanisch verhoogde krachtin-werking en de vasculaire afwijkingen (1). Devasculaire inbreng wordt hier buiten beschou-wing gelaten.De neuropathie veroorzaakt sensibiliteits-stoornissen waardoor reacties bij verwondingvan de voetzoolhuid uitblijven.Daarnaast wordt de motoriek verstoord,waardoor er een verminderde werking van deintrinsieke voetzoolmusculatuur aanwezig is.Dit kan aanleiding geven tot deformaties in deverhouding van de voetgewrichtjes.Tot slot is er ook de autonome neuropathiemet een verminderde functie van de zweet-kliertjes. Dit, gekoppeld aan de gekendeverminderde soepelheid van de diabetische huiden de neiging tot verhoogde eeltvorming,draagt bij tot blaarvorming op de voetzool.Deze evolueert naar necrose van de opperhuidmet ulceratievorming.Tot de mechanische factoren behoort deverhoogde drukwerking op de voetzool. Delaatste twee decennia heeft men kunnen aan-tonen dat diabetespatie¨nten met een plantairvoetulcus hogere piekdrukken vertonen aan deonderzijde van de voetzool in vergelijking metdiabetici zonder voetproblemen (2). De lokali-satie van een genezen ulcus kwam overeen metde regio’s van hoogste piekdruk inwerkend opde voetzool (3). Een duidelijke verklaring hier-voor heeft men niet. Wel vertonen diabetes-patie¨nten een beperking van de bewegings-amplitudo van de voetwortelgewrichten. Dezebeperking kan het gevolg zijn van de niet-enzymatische glycolisatie van de collageen-vezels van de gewrichtsligamenten, waardoorde ligamenten stugger worden. Deze beperktegewrichtsmobiliteit (limited joint mobility,LJM) is pathognomonisch voor de verhoogdedruk op de voetzool bij de diabetespatie¨nt.813SamenvattingDiabetische voetpathologie is een multi-factorie¨le entiteit.

      "title": "RECOGNISING AND DIAGNOSING INFLAMMATORY BRAIN DISEASE",
      "abstract": "In contrast to ‘conventional’ neuro-inflammatory or neuro-immune diseases like multiple sclerosis, CNS involvement in systemic inflammatory disorders can be very difficult to recognise, and even more difficult to confirm. Vasculitis, lupus, sarcoidosis and other disorders all may involve the brain and/or spinal cord, and in each instance, presentation with exclusively neurological features is far from unknown. In most such disorders, there are no diagnostic clinical features; many of these diseases mimic each other. Once suspected, it is commonly the case that no tests are available that categorically prove the disease to be present—other than cerebral biopsy, and even this has limited sensitivity and clearly carries a certain risk. A number of investigations often considered valuable are neither sensitive nor specific, and are prone to over-interpretation. CNS inflammatory diseases may be aggressive, seriously disabling or even fatal—and yet most are highly treatable. Clinical nomenclature and definitions have not helped a complex field—many are at best confusing, and often wholly misleading. Vasculitis, for example, is neither a diagnosis nor a disease, but rather a histopathological description (intramural inflammation, often but not invariably with additional perivascular infiltrates, accompanied by necrosis of the blood vessel wall). Lupoid sclerosis, a term firmly embedded in the literature, probably does not exist; lupus vasculitis is a ‘diagnosis9 in rather commonly usage, but in fact very rarely is it a useful or accurate description of CNS lupus-related disease.&nbsp; Nonetheless, progress in this difficult area is being made. Clinical scenarios when such disorders ought to feature in a differential diagnosis are better defined, and symptoms or signs that help raise suspicion of individual disorders may be putatively put forward (based in the main on lessons from internal medicine rather than neurology). Approaches to confirming CNS inflammatory diagnoses can be suggested, with increasing recognition of the limitations of investigative techniques. Finally, and admittedly again almost wholly informed by clinical research in systemic inflammatory disorders, rather than good quality clinical trials in patients with neurological disease, treatment regimes are improving. A brief overview of these changes will be presented.",

A number of sub-types or syndromes, e.g. the so-called Korsakov syndrome, are contained in the mnestic syndrome.

However, heterogeneity may be unavoidable because of the biopsychosocial complexity of depression. MDD may be characterised by complexities that cannot be distilled down to any brief set of diagnostic criteria. Psychiatrists and psychiatric epidemiologists may need to revise their expectations of this diagnosis in order to avoid over-estimating its ability to guide the selection of treatments and prediction of prognosis. An opposing perspective is that of reification, in which the diagnosis is viewed as being more real than it really is. The concept of rheostasis may help to explain some features of this condition, such as why major depressive episodes sometimes seem understandable or even adaptive (e.g. in the context of bereavement) whereas at other times such episodes are inexplicable and maladaptive.",

Elle n'est alors pas seule responsable du retard. Dans le cadre des encéphalopathies avec épilepsie une démarche diagnostique rigoureuse est nécessaire avec notamment un examen cutané (syndromes neuro‐cutanés), un examen moteur (séquelles anoxo‐ischémiques de la période périnatale), un EEG, une imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM) cérébrale ainsi que la recherche d'anomalies associées (cardiaque, rénale…). D'autre part il existe des encéphalopathies épileptogènes telles que les syndromes liés à l'âge : syndrome hémiconvulsions, hémiplégie, épilepsie (HHE) ; syndrome de Rasmussen, épilepsie myoclonique sévère du nourrisson (syndrome de Dravet), épilepsie myoclono‐astatique (Doose) que nous développerons comme exemples. L'âge, le type de crises et l'EEG sont utiles pour le diagnostic dans ce cas, les autres examens étant généralement peu contributifs. Retard et épilepsie sont souvent associés et la première étape du diagnostic est d'essayer de comprendre si l'épilepsie est une cause active du désordre cognitif ou non, afin d'affiner la démarche étiologique mais aussi d'adapter la prise en charge thérapeutique.",

      "abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting multiple organ systems. 30-40 % of the patients manifest variable neuropsychiatric symptoms leading to significant morbidity and mortality. CNS involvement could be primary if directly related to SLE activity in the CNS or secondary to treatment, infections, metabolic abnormalities or other systemic manifestations such as hypertension (Futrell et al,1992). Primary NPSLE is divided into focal and diffuse disease. Focal NPSLE is characterized by focal neurologic deficits and is strongly associated with the occurrence of thromboembolic events. Diffuse primary NPSLE is a group of neurologic, psychiatric, and cognitive syndromes that vary from overt neurologic and psychiatric symptoms (eg. seizures, psychosis) to more subtle signs such as headache, mood disturbances, anxiety disorders or mild cognitive dysfunction. Neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE) manifestations can occur in the absence of either serologic activity or other systemic disease manifestations (Sibbit et al., 1999). Thus, in clinical practice the diagnosis of primary NPSLE is rather presumptive, after the exclusion of alternative causes of the neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is no single diagnostic test that is sensitive and specific for SLE-related neuropsychiatric manifestations. The assessment of individual patients is based on clinical, neurologic and rheumatologic evaluation, immunoserologic testing, brain imaging, and psychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. These examinations are used to support or refute the clinical diagnostic impression, rule out alternative explanations, and form the basis for prospective monitoring of clinical evolution and response to treatment interventions. The lack of a diagnostic gold standard makes the correct diagnosis of primary NPSLE a challenge. This realization has led us in developing under the auspices of the European League Against Rheumatology (EULAR) evidence and expert based recommendations for the management of NPSLE (Bertsias et al, 2010).",

      "title": "Basal Ganglia Disease And Depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases of the basal ganglia are quintessential neuropsychiatric disorders, characterized by abnormal movements, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms and signs. Depression is common in these illnesses and may occur at presentation or during the course of the illness. Individuals may present to the psychiatrist before seeing a neurologist. Depression is an important target for research, as it affords a unique perspective on the pathophysiology of basal ganglia diseases as well as an alternative method of understanding the biology of mood disorders. Traditionally, basal ganglia diseases are diagnosed and treated by neurologists, who define their onset by specific motor manifestations. Psychiatric symptomatology has been considered peripheral to the understanding of the motor disorders that define basal ganglia diseases. There is growing evidence for the contrary view that mood and affect are integrally related to the evolution of these diseases. For example, in diseases such as Huntington’s disease or Wilson’s disease, where the genetic mutation has been identified, it is possible to identify presymptomatic individuals, prior to the development of motor signs, who are unaware of their genetic status, and determine whether cognitive or psychiatric manifestations occur more often in gene-positive than in genenegative individuals. Another way to examine the role of psychiatric impairment is to study individuals in the general population who have undergone psychiatric assessments and to determine if individuals with a history of affective disorder are more likely to develop specific basal ganglia diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) than individuals without mood disorders. This chapter includes a review of the epidemiology, prevalence, and correlates of depression in basal ganglia diseases and their treatment.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionNeuropathic pain can be caused by a number of different diseases such as diabetes mellitus (DM), herpes zoster, Human Inmunodeficiency virus (HIV), cancer or secondary to treatment i.e. radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery.Alterations in the nerve pathways such as trigeminal or nerve roots can lead to pain.Another study from Mayo Clinic reported neuropathic pain in 66% of insulin-dependent diabetic patients and 59% in non-insulin dependent diabetic patients (Davies 2006).Epidemiological study in Minnesota reported an annual incidence of postherpetic neuralgia to be 11.6 per 100,000 people per year, similar to seen in UK with a lifetime incidence of 70/100, 000.(Dyck 1993) Traditionally, neuropathic pain has been classified into peripheral and central, taking into account the anatomical location of the lesion or anatomical dysfunction.The current definition of neuropathic pain indicates that it is \"pain that arises as a direct result of an injury or illness affecting the somatosensory system\" (Treede 2008).Several recent studies have shown that neuropathic pain may adversely affect the overall quality of life including physical and emotional health (Oster 2005), which are associated with significant social costs (O ' Connor 2009).Neuropathic pain is associated with suffering, disability, decreased quality of life and increased costs.The exact prevalence is unknown.German Studies state that 37% of patients with chronic low back pain have predominantly neuropathic pain, in terms of painful diabetic neuropathy occurs in 16% in patients with diabetes in the UK, one third of these patients had never received Treatment for this type of pain.In the United States two-thirds of patients with painful diabetic neuropathy workers reported absence from work or decreased productivity due to pain and only one fifth of these employees were satisfied with their treatment prescribed analgesic (Bouhassira 2008).Of the various etiologies of neuropathic pain DM needs the most attention due to the increasing number of patients expected by 2025.It is estimated that the present number of 246 million people worldwide will increase to 380 million especialy in developing countries.Though estimated 80% of these patients live in developing or under developed countries only 20% increased will be in the budget to treat this condition (Walters1992/Davies 2006).These epidemiological data support that neuropathic pain has severe impact on the economic, social and emotional aspects of patient population.www.intechopen.com",

These features may be present as associated symptoms during a depressive episode or as specific comorbidities (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder). Other symptoms, including fatigue or low energy and cognitive dysfunction (problems with concentration, memory, decision-making), warrant special attention because they are major mediators of functional impairment and are common residual symptoms during treatment. The presence of these associated clinical features can affect the differential diagnosis and management of depression, e.g. in the selection and use of an antidepressant and/or a psychological treatment.",

Karya Tulis Ilmiah Studi Kasus, Program Studi DIII Keperawatan, Jurusan Keperawatan, Politeknik Kesehatan Kemenkes Riau. Pembimbing (I) Ns. Nia Khusniyati M, S.Kep, M.Kep (II) Hj. Melly, SST, M.Kes.\r\n\r\nDiabetes Mellitus adalah suatu keadaan dimana tubuh bisa menghasilkan hormon insulin sesuai kebutuhan atau tubuh tidak bisa memanfaatkan secara optimal insulin yang dihasilkan, sehingga terjadi lonjakan kadar gula dalam darah melebihi normal. Pada penderita diabetes mellitus terutama yang sudah bersifat kronik dapat terjadi gangguan atau komplikasi berupa neuropati diabetik, protein uria, kelainan koroner. Pada kerusakan sistem saraf dibagi tiga kelompok yaitu kerusakan sistem saraf perifer, kerusakan saraf otonom, kerusakan saraf motorik. Kerusakan sistem saraf perifer pada umumnya dapat menyebabkan kesemutan, nyeri pada tangan dan kaki, serta berkurangnya sensitifitas atau mati rasa. Sehingga penderita diabetes mellitus lebih tinggi resikonya mengalami masalah kaki yaitu sirkulasi darah kaki ke tungkai yang menurun, berkurangnya perasaan pada kaki, berkurangnya daya tahan tubuh terhadap infeksi. Pada umumnya penderita diabetes mellitus terlambat untuk menyadari bahwa terjadi luka pada kakinya disebabkan gangguan sirkulasi pembuluh darah yang menyebabkan luka tersebut sukar untuk sembuh dan akan menjadi ulkus atau gangren. Tujuan dari penulisan ini adalah mahasiswa mampu memberi asuhan keperawatan secara komprehensif dengan metode kasus yang dilakukan terhadap Ny. J pada tanggal 30 Maret sampai 01 April 2020. Hasil studi kasus ini menyebutkan bahwa Ny. J mengalami diabetes mellitus tipe 2 dengan ulkus diabetik dengan empat masalah keperawtan yaitu nyeri, hambatan mobilitas fisik, kerusakan integritas kulit, resiko infeksi. Evaluasi selama menjalani perawatan nyeri yang dirasakan hilang, nyaman dalam beraktifitas, luka pada kaki pada fase maturasi (penyembuhan). Saran untuk perawat di UPT puskesmas sungai pakning terutama perawat di ruangan rawat inap untuk dapat menerapkan asuhan keperawatan klien diabetes mellitus tipe 2 dengan ulkus diabetik secara komprehensif yang memperhatikan kesembuhan pasien secara teratur. Saran untuk penulis selanjutnya adalah studi kasus ini dapat dikembangkan lagi untuk penulis selanjutnya pada asuhan keperawatan yang lebih rinci lagi untuk menghasilkan asuhan keperawatan yang lebih berkualitas dan bermanfaat bagi pasien. \r\n\r\nKata kunci : Diabetes Mellitus, Ulkus Diabetik, Nyeri, Hambatan Mobilitas, Kerusakan Integritas Kulit, Resiko Infeksi",

Un certain nombre de modifications observees sont de type dynamique dont certaines variables peuvent etre considerees comme des variables de trait et d'autres des variables d'etat. L'alteration des fonctions cognitives est souvent associee a une intensite symptomatique plus elevee. Certaines des anomalies cognitives persistent au-dela de l'episode depressif, representant des caracteristiques fondamentales de type trait. Il est important d'evaluer les fonctions cognitives des patients apres le retour a l'equilibre de l'humeur pour permettre de mieux caracteriser l'evolution et la nature des symptomes non affectifs associes au trouble depressif. La performance en memoire episodique des sujets âges deprimes a ete retrouvee proche de celle de temoins apparies en âge, la plainte en memoire des patients depend de l'intensite de leur depression. Un deficit des fonctions d'attention ou de memoire immediate est susceptible d'interferer avec la plupart des actions et comportements de la vie de tous les jours. Les patients deprimes en phase symptomatique manifestent davantage d'erreurs d'attention par comparaison avec des temoins apparies. Les meta-analyses rappellent l'existence d'un deficit des processus requerant un effort dans les etats depressifs. Les baisses de performance observees dans les fonctions executives chez des patients souffrant d'etat depressif seraient liees a un dysfonctionnement des regions ventro-medianes et des parties dorsales du cortex cingulaire anterieur.

Clinicians are seeing more of these injuries as weight training, power lifting, bodybuilding, cross-training, and general physical conditioning with weights become more popular. Symptoms of pain, weakness, paresthesia, or palsy; physical exam findings; electromyography; and nerve conduction studies are used to make the diagnosis. Most conditions respond well to conservative measures, such as rest from the offending exercise and correction of poor technique, but surgery may be required for complete clinical resolution in severe cases.",

Electrodiagnostic techniques have an important role in neuropsychiatric diagnosis. Magneto-encephalography (MEG) measures the small magnetic fields generated by neuronal currents and may be regarded as the magnetic counterpart of the electroencephalograms (EEG). Neuroimaging techniques can be broadly divided into structural and functional. The two major techniques of structural imaging are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Functional imaging techniques are used primarily to provide information on metabolism, blood flow, neurochemistry or activity of the brain. Mental disorder is characterised by the presence of mental symptoms that are judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition. The essential features are prominent hallucinations or delusions that are judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of the medical condition or substance.",

Dementias are frequently progressive, and chances of recovery are rare except for several uncommon illnesses. Dementias are characterized by impairment in consciousness and inattention, orientation, memory, and other intellectual or cognitive functioning.

      "abstract": "There is often difficulty differentiating between psychosomatic, somatopsychic, multisystem illness, and different degrees of medical uncertainty. Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

      "abstract": "The management of a patient with epilepsy requires the physician to address himself to two basic tasks: (1) an accurate diagnosis must be made with special attention to the possibility of progressive intracranial disease; and (2) an effective regimen for control of the seizures must be devised. DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGE Seizures beginning in infancy are accompanied, in about half of cases, by other evidence of cerebral damage, especially mental subnormality. The precise pathology often cannot be determined during life, although a cerebral developmental defect or birth injury is usually responsible. In a small proportion of cases a metabolic error, subdural hematoma, neuronal degenerative disease, or some other progressive process will be revealed by a history of deterioration in skills previously acquired. The diagnosis can then be established by other characteristic signs of the condition under consideration and appropriate laboratory studies. Grand mal, focal seizures and minor motor seizures are the types usually encountered in infancy. The same factors which commonly cause seizures in infancy continue to initiate seizures in childhood and early adolescence, but to a steadily decreasing extent. Thus, seizures due to a birth injury, like most post-traumatic seizures, usually begin within 24 months after the traumatic incident1; however, they may be delayed until late childhood or adolescence. Seizures appearing as a sequela of meningitis or other infections are sometimes similarly delayed. After the second year of life, seizures of unknown cause rapidly increase in incidence, including cases of so-called genetic epilepsy. In the latter, centrencephalic seizure bursts (3/sec wave and spike discharges) appear diffusely in the EEG, not only in patients, but in 45% of their asymptomatic siblings (aged 4 to 16 years), as well.",

Mittels neuropsychologischer Testverfahren konnen die betroffenen Domanen klinisch identifiziert und naher klassifiziert werden. Neben der Demenz finden sich bei den Patienten ebenfalls psychische und Verhaltenssymptome wie emotionale Verstimmungen, Depressionen, Angstzustande und vermehrte Aggressionsausbruche sowie Veranderungen der Personlichkeit. All diese Faktoren fuhren zu einer zunehmenden Beeintrachtigung und haben einen erheblichen Einfluss auf die Lebensqualitat nicht nur des Betroffenen, sondern fuhren ebenfalls zu einer zunehmenden Belastung der Angehorigen, verandern die Krankheitsprognose und stellen im fortgeschrittenen Stadium einen der wichtigsten Grunde fur eine Heimeinweisung dar. Bei vielen neurologischen Erkrankungen sind die neurologischen Kardinalsymptome bereits einer medikamentosen Behandlung zuganglich, wahrend dies bei den kognitiven Symptomen schwieriger ist. Derzeit sind nur vier Medikamente zur Behandlung der Demenz zugelassen (Cholinesterasehemmer: Donepezil, Galantamin, Rivastigmin und der NMDA-Antagonist Memantin), die aber uber die AlzheimerDemenz hinaus, meist keine Zulassung fur kognitive Storungen bei anderen neurologischen Erkrankungen besitzen. Die Studienlage ist fur die Cholinesterasehemmer und Memantin fur den Einsatz bei kognitiven Defiziten bei neurologischen Erkrankungen ungenugend. Daruber hinaus werden in Deutschland mehr als 200 Millionen Euro jahrlich fur „antidementive“ Substanzen ausgegeben, die keine Evidenz fur einen klinischen Effekt nachweisen konnen.

      "abstract": "Sometimes concussion is accompanied by an abrupt change in behavior, including psychosis or dementia, but concussion is not necessarily the cause. It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

By reviewing various epidemiological studies, relationships among some chronic diseases and depression have been noted. The depression-disease order of appearance can de bi-directional. It seems that stress, depression and inflammation have the capacity to affect the balance of cykotines produced by the immunological system. Modulation of the immunological system by the central nervous system is controIled/mediada by a complex bi-directional network composed of signals among the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immunological system. The most frequent diseases related to depression are chronic but some are acute: of the central nervous system, endocrines, infections. Chronic pain also seems related to this problem. Pain, fatigue or tiredness are considered symptoms of a hidden depression and others, physical as well as psychiatric, could be algias, parestesias, headaches, vertigo, or gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "Involution old age limit is related to general health, cultural and economic living conditions. Two stages of old age are currently recognized: early old age (65 to 75 years) and over 75 years - late old age period. Old age period is the third life cycle period in which aging of the brain and eventual pathological changes with respective organic psychopathological onsets are finalized. In many countries, number of the population over 65 years of age increases. The same applies for our country. Term of psychic disorders includes miscellaneous psychic conditions, pathologic in terms of symptom intensity, personality and social behavior changes, and reflects on social life of the ill individual and its family. Psychiatric syndromes and disorders in older population Rogina divides into two groups: - disorders of emotional reacting and behavior, without manifestations of other organic brain or physical disorders and - alternations caused by primary brain pathology, clinically presented as organic brain psycho-syndrome with different intensity and different pathogenesis etymology (cardiovascular, cerebro-vascular, neoplastic, metabolic, etc.) A combination of physical illness and mental disorder is the most common cause of the first hospitalization in older age.",

      "abstract": "Pathological 43-kDa transactive responsive DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) has been identified as the major, i.e. disease defining, pathological protein in the majority of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) with or without motor neuron disease (MND), which is known now as FTLD-TDP (1,2). ALS has been linked to FTLD through TDP-43 pathology that may be widespread in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby creating a new concept of TDP-43 proteinopathy as a disease continuum that encompasses ALS and FTLD as well as rarer conditions such as progressive muscular atrophy or primary lateral sclerosis (3, for review see (4)). TDP-43 pathology in addition, or ‘secondary’, to disease defining inclusion pathologies may occur in other neurodegenerative diseases such as tauopathies or α-synulceinopathies (4). A subgroup of ALS and FTLD cases with neuronal inclusions composed of an ubiquitinated protein, negative for pathological TDP-43, tau, or α-synuclein, was shown to be characterized by the pathological aggregation of a protein called fused in sarcoma (FUS), which shows functional homology to TDP-43 (5–7). Previous to the identification of these two disease defining proteins, there have been reports of single cases of sporadic or familiar ALS or FTLD cases showing pathological tau aggregations (or neurofibrillary tangles) as their pathological hallmark feature with (8) or without (9–14) the presence of additional ubiquitinated inclusions, published by research groups in continental Europe and Asia. The tau pathology in these cases is in part reminiscent of the Parkinsonism-dementia complex and ALS (ALS/PDC) occurring in geographic isolates such as the Kii Peninsula of Japan (15) or Guam in the Mariana Islands (16–18). These are tauopathies that differ from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in terms of their topographical distribution of tau pathology and the lower level of amyloid-β depositions (19). We here report a patient with sporadic ALS and eye closure apraxia from the continental United States showing multisystem tau pathology atypical for AD by morphology in the brain and spinal cord. There also were robust cortical amyloid-β deposits, but no pathognomonic TDP-43, FUS or α-synuclein pathology. We conclude that tau pathology alone is sufficient to cause ALS and FLTD-MND-like neurodegeneration in the continental United States suggesting that, in part, similar pathogenetic mechanisms might be involved in the patient described in this report, as in ALS occurring in the Kii Peninsula and Guam.",

In the assessment of cognitive functioning in the elderly, there are at least four ways in which a model or theoretical approach is useful for differentiating among the disorders affecting the elderly. Neuropsychology plays an especially important role in the diagnosis of disorders in the elderly whenever cognitive functioning has been compromised. The medical and psychiatric history included marked anxiety presenting early and consistently in the disorder, outstanding memory disorder with the eventual development of a dementia, seizures, abnormal EEG, and a secondary carcinoma in the lung. The stage model has the potential for confirming or disconfirming a diagnosis because deviations from the predicted pattern of regression would signify that a different disorder is present.",

Neurological and cardiac symptoms may share underlying physiopathological mechanisms in diseases, such as Friedreich's ataxia and Wilson's disease, and in certain metabolic disorders, including Refsum disease, Gaucher disease, a congenital disorder of glycosylation, or cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. In certain conditions, such as Sydenham's chorea or dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome (ATX-DNAJC19), heart involvement can present early in the course of disease, whereas in others such as Friedreich's ataxia or Refsum disease, cardiac symptoms tend to present in later stages. In another 68 acquired or inherited conditions, cardiac involvement or movement disorders are seldom reported.As cardiac disease is part of the phenotypic spectrum of several movement disorders, heart involvement should be carefully investigated and increased awareness of this association encouraged as it may represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychologists provide detailed assessments of cognitive and emotional functioning that often cannot be obtained through other diagnostic means. They use standardized assessment tools and integrate the findings with other data to determine whether cognitive decline has occurred, to differentiate neurologic from psychiatric conditions, to identify neurocognitive etiologies, and to determine the relationship between neurologic factors and difficulties in daily functioning. Family physicians should consider referring patients when there are questions about diagnostic decision making or planning of individualized management strategies for patients with mild cognitive impairment, dementia, traumatic brain injury, and other clinical conditions that affect cognitive functioning. Neuropsychological testing can differentiate Alzheimer dementia from nondementia with nearly 90% accuracy. The addition of neuropsychological testing to injury severity variables (e.g., posttraumatic amnesia) increases predicted accuracy in functional outcomes. A neuropsychological evaluation can be helpful in addressing concerns about functional capacities (e.g., ability to drive or live independently) and in determining a patient's capacity to make decisions about health care or finances. Most patients who underwent neuropsychological evaluation and their significant others reported that they found the evaluation helpful in understanding and coping with cognitive problems.",

      "title": "Characterizing the phenomenology of anxiety in older adults with subjective cognitive decline",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), defined as perception of memory or other cognitive decline with normal test performance, is conceptualized as a preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease. Formulations of SCD typically include presence of worry or concern regarding the perceived cognitive decline. Accordingly, SCD is associated with anxiety, but its underlying etiology remains unclear. In the current study, we compared mood, anxiety, and personality amongst SCD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults to characterize anxiety in SCD. Methods 146 older adults received psychiatric/medical assessments, self‐report measures of subjective memory, and neuropsychological (NP) tests to establish diagnosis. MCI [n=33,17F, age 72.3(SD6.7)] had subjective memory/other cognitive complaints, impaired NP performance, and functional independence. SCD [n=71,49F, age 71.1(SD6.3)] endorsed subjective memory decline with worry and normal NP performance. CU [n=42, 27F, age 70.6(SD6.8)] had normal NP performance and absence of subjective memory decline with worry. Participants were free of lifetime history of psychiatric illness and neurological conditions. They completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), NEO Five‐Factor Inventory (NEO‐FFI) which includes neuroticism, Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Multivariate ANOVA was used to examine group differences, followed by post hoc comparisons with Sidak correction. Results Groups differed in STAI‐trait, NEO‐FFI neuroticism, HAI, and GDS [F(2,143)=5.26, P=.006; F(2,143)=3.26, P=.041; F(2,143)=4.61, P=.011; F(2,143)=7.66, P=.046, respectively]. Relative to CU, STAI‐trait and HAI scores were elevated in SCD and MCI (P’s&lt;.05). NEO‐FFI neuroticism was higher in SCD compared to CU (P=.024). No differences between SCD and MCI were detected on any measure. Differences in GDS scores did not survive Sidak correction. Conclusions Anxiety symptoms in SCD without lifetime history of psychiatric illness are best conceptualized as neuroticism, a personality trait that increases proneness to negative affect. Based on non‐elevated levels of state anxiety and depression, anxiety in SCD does not appear to represent an emotional reaction to cognitive decline nor epiphenomena of subclinical depression. Health anxiety, or belief that one has a serious illness, was comparable in SCD and MCI. Future research is needed to clarify the role of neuroticism and its links with subjective and objective memory in SCD.",

      "abstract": "There is little written in the geriatric literature about the concept of psychological frailty which encompasses cognitive, mood, and motivational components. The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

      "abstract": "One of the most common co-morbidities of cerebrovascular disorders is neuroinflammation, a hallmark and decisive contributor to many central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Although neuropathological conditions differ in etiology and in the way in which the inflammatory response is mounted, cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation are probably similar in aging, hypertension, depression and cognitive impairment or after cerebral insult such as stroke. Moreover, a number of highly prevalent risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis are increasingly understood to act as “silent contributors” to neuroinflammation – not only establishing the condition as a central pathophysiological mechanism, but also constantly fuelling it. Mild, but continuous neuroinflammation can provide the ground for disorders such as cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and subsequent dementia. Acute neuroinflammation, often in the context of traumatic or ischemic CNS lesions, aggravates the acute damage and can lead to depression, post-stroke dementia and neurodegeneration. All of these sequelae impair recovery and provide the ground for further cerebrovascular events.",

      "abstract": "Summary In the long term after traumatic brain injury, the most disabling problems are generally related to neuropsychiatric sequelae, including personality change and cognitive impairment, rather than neurophysical sequelae. Cognitive impairment after severe injury is likely to include impaired speed of information processing, poor memory and executive problems. Personality change may include poor motivation, and a tendency to be self-centred and less aware of the needs of others. Patients may be described as lazy and thoughtless. Some become disinhibited and rude. Agitation and aggression can be very difficult to manage. Anxiety and depression symptoms are quite frequent and play a role in the development of persistent post-concussion syndrome after milder injury. Depression may be associated with a deterioration in disability over time after injury. Psychosis is not unusual though it has been difficult to confirm that traumatic brain injury is a cause of schizophrenia. Head injury may, many years later, increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Good rehabilitation probably minimizes the risk of psychiatric sequelae, but specific psychological and pharmacological treatments may be needed.",

Once it is determined that a patient has vertigo, the next task is to determine whether the patient has a peripheral or central cause of vertigo. Knowing the typical clinical presentations of the various causes of vertigo aids in making this distinction. The history (i.e., timing and duration of symptoms, provoking factors, associated signs and symptoms) and physical examination (especially of the head and neck and neurologic systems, as well as special tests such as the Dix-Hallpike maneuver) provide important clues to the diagnosis. Associated neurologic signs and symptoms, such as nystagmus that does not lessen when the patient focuses, point to central (and often more serious) causes of vertigo, which require further work-up with selected laboratory and radiologic studies such as magnetic resonance imaging.",

Their occurrence is an additional factor of poor outcome for neurologic patients. Although they have been recognized and completely described in their clinical manifestations more than a century ago, many issues remain unsolved regarding their pathogenesis and the respective role of the brain damage and psychological factors. Thus, if pathological crying and laughing can be linked to one or more lesions within the corticospinal tracts, the emotional lability and CR have uncertain connections within specific functional brain systems and seem to be influenced by personality factors or depression and anxiety generated by coping with a serious neurological disease. These epistemological difficulties are also the consequence of some methodological limits of the questionnaires and scales, which diagnose these disorders and for which the cut-off values between the normal and pathological condition could be questioned. Thus, their assessment requires new psychophysical. The CR and emotionalism manifest in association with several different neurological disease (degenerative, vascular, inflammatory, epilepsy) and psychiatric conditions as psychosis, mania, and mood disorders. Across these different diseases, the findings of common patterns of lesion location, cognitive dysfunction, emotional changes, and behavioral responses to new paradigms might clarify the pathogenesis and orient the treatment.",

Results Dyskinetic subjects presented more indirect indicators of occult brain damage, such as a perinatal event or traumatic brain injuries in infancy and early childhood; neurological examination showed more anomalies in dyskinetic patients than in non-dyskinetics, with a higher prevalence of facial release reflexes.

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder currently diagnosed solely on the presence of motor symptoms (i.e., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability) and their response to dopamine replacement therapy. A major unmet need is the limited number and failure of clinical trials with putative neuroprotective agents intended to halt or delay disease progression. Three main reasons account for this development: ( i ) At the time of the clinical diagnosis >50% of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have degenerated (1) and other neurotransmitter systems (e.g., norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine) have been affected, indicating that the disease is already at an advanced stage (2); ( ii ) some reports suggest low accuracy for a PD clinical diagnosis, with up to 50% misdiagnosis in early disease (i.e., within 5 y of diagnosis) (3); and ( iii ) there is still no objective meaningful endpoint for clinical trials for early PD other than the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), a rater-based assessment of symptom severity. Thus, there is a need for objective biomarkers that either are neuropathophysiological manifestations of the disease (marker of state), track the speed of its progression (marker of rate), or are present in at-risk PD (marker of trait) (4). Adding complexity to this endeavor is the fact that PD is very heterogeneous in its clinical, neuropathological, and probably also pathophysiological presentation, with various subtyping strategies based on motor and also nonmotor symptoms recently proposed (5).

      "abstract": "Multipl skleroz (MS) sıklıkla genç erişkinlerde görülen, santral sinir sisteminin demiyelinizasyon ve akson kaybı ile sonuçlanan inflamatuar otoimmün bir hastalığıdır. Hastalık sıklıkla nörolojik belirtilerle ortaya çıkmakla beraber, seyrinde veya başlangıcında psikiyatrik belirtiler de görülebilmektedir. Bipolar bozukluk, intihar girişimi, anksiyete ve depresyon MS'ye eşlik eden psikiyatrik bozukluklardır ve görülme sıklıkları normal populasyona göre MS hastalarında artmıştır. Bu artışın nedeninin MS'de kompleks mekanizmalara bağlı olduğu düşünülse de, hastalığın seyrinin ilerleyici olması, ciddi işlev kayıpları ile sonuçlanması gibi psikososyal faktörlerle de ilişkili bulunmuştur. Psikososyal faktörler dışında hastalığın bilinen patofizyolojisinin sonucu olarak ve ayrıca hastalıkta uygulanan tedavilerin psikiyatrik bozukluklara zemin oluşturduğu düşünülmektedir. En sık görülen semptomlardan depresyonun etiyolojisinde serebral lezyonlarla otoimmün etkenler de sorumlu tutulmuştur. Serebral lezyon yükü ve plak anatomik lokalizasyonları depresyon şiddeti ile ilişkili bulunmuştur. İkinci sıklıkta gözlenen anksiyetenin sıklıkla psikososyal sorunlara reaktif oluştuğu saptanmıştır. MS hastalarında intihar düşüncesinde normal populasyona göre ciddi artış olması öncelikle psikososyal nedenler gibi görünmektedir, fakat interferon tedavisinin etkisinin olduğu birtakım çalışmalarda gözlenmiştir. Bipolar bozukluğun multifaktöriyel olduğu gözlenmiş, fakat interferon tedavisi ile ilişkili vakalar bildirilmiştir. Psikotik bozuklukların da MS hastalarında interferon tedavisi ile ilişkisini gösteren vakalar vardır. MS hastalarında eş tanılı anksiyete ve depresyon; artmış intihar düşüncesi, alkol kötüye kullanımı, artmış somatik yakınmalar daha fazla sosyal bozulma ile ilişkilendirilmiştir. Bu nedenle MS'ye eşlik eden psikiyatrik bozuklukları tanımak ve tedavi etmek hastalığın seyrinde ve hastaların yaşam kalitesinde olumlu etkiler yaratacaktır. Bu çalışmada, MS'de görülen psikiyatrik bulgu ve bozukluklar, hastalığın etiyopatogenezi ve tedavi yaklaşımları ile ilgili güncel bilgiler tartışılmıştır.",

An important clinical consideration for IEED is that of distinguishing mood from affect. IEED describes a syndrome of relatively stereotypical episodes of uncontrollable crying and/or laughing, resulting from lesions of multiple types, in multiple brain regions, without an apparent stimulus to trigger such responses. This syndrome is common among a number of neurological diseases like patients with a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as dementias such as Alzheimer;s disease (AD), and motor disorders such as Parkinson;s disease (PD). The neuropathological cause and neurochemistry of the disorder remains unclear. There is general agreement that IEED is the result of an injury to the neurological pathways that control the expression of emotions. Adequate treatment can reduce the frequency and improve the quality of life of patients and caregivers.",

      "abstract": "Memory problems are a common complaint in most older persons. The brain has two kinds of memory – recent and remote (old). Recent memory includes facts or events that occurred within the last hour so, while remote (old) memory is facts or events from the distant past, e.g., college memories, high school memories, etc. Recent memory is like a computer workstation while remote memory or old memory is like the hard disk. The brain remembers facts or events by loading them into recent memory and then moving them to old memory. Your hard disk becomes saturated somewhere around 40 to 60-years of age and after 60 it becomes slightly more difficult to hold on to facts or events. Scientists recognize four general types of memory states for older people: 1) good as new, 2) good as almost new, 3) mild impairment, and 4) dementia. “Good as new” means that you can remember things as well as when you were 20 or 30 years of age. “Good as almost new” means that it’s harder to remember large bodies of information but you can still commit normal amounts of information to memory. Mild cognitive impairment means that memory is impaired to the point where people have difficulty, but they do not have other evidence of dementia. Dementia means that memory is lost and other intellectual functions are also damaged, e.g., communication, motor skills.",

People who have long-term medical issues, on the other hand are more than twice as likely to be depressed and anxiety as the general population. The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

      "abstract": ": Neurological diseases expose individuals to a higher risk of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior, including completed suicides and suicide attempts. They also represent a paradigmatic arena to study the etiopathogenic mechanisms underlying suicidality because they are emblematic of the heterogeneity and complexity of mutual interrelationships characterizing this issue. On the one hand, neurological diseases imply strictly biological impairments that are postulated to be the basis of vulnerability to suicide or result in the need for treatments for which a suicidal risk has been hypothesized. On the other hand, they question some subjective experiences of neurological patients, up to near existential positions. Often, in fact, they are accompanied by severe hopelessness. The latter may originate in, particularly for the most severe neurological diseases, the absence of curative treatments, unpredictable disease progression that leads to acute relapses or chronicity, a decrease in autonomy or selfidentity, progressive social isolation, a sense of becoming useless, and perception of feeling stigmatized. This may ultimately cause a slip into experiencing an absurd condition. At the confluence of neurobiology and hopelessness, frequent psychiatric comorbidities may play a primary role. To conclude, neurological patients require special attention from clinicians in form of openly verbalizing and exploring the suicidal thematic, inquiring about protective and risk factors, and promptly initiating both a psychopharmacological treatment and, where possible, psychological support.",

At an early stage of most neurodegenerative diseases, including the Frontotemporal Dementias, it can be very difficult to determine whether a person has symptoms of a progressive illness or is suffering from a condition less likely to progress, or even exhibiting symptoms consistent with normal aging. It is critical to identify individuals with MCI, since people with this clinical syndrome are at elevated risk of progressive cognitive decline. In the case of Primary Progressive Aphasia, a neurodegenerative disease in which speech and/or language abilities are gradually lost, a speech-language pathologist (SLP) may be one of the initial clinical providers in the MCI stage. The SLP is therefore critical in helping to determine whether a change in language abilities is a result of normal aging, a neurodegenerative process, or other etiologies.",

      "title": "Sialorrhea: a review of a vexing, often unrecognized sign of oropharyngeal and esophageal disease.",
      "abstract": "Saliva is produced by the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual), as well as several smaller glands. Salivary flow can be altered by multiple entities. There is much written regarding xerostomia (\"dry mouth\"), the condition related to inhibited or decreased salivary flow. This condition is widely recognized in certain systemic diseases, particularly Sjögren syndrome, diabetes mellitus, after anticholinergic, antihistamine, and decongestant medications, as well as states of enhanced sympathetic drive, such as anxiety or emotional disturbances and various other psychosocial conditions. On the other hand, sialorrhea or ptyalism, the condition of increased salivary flow, is rarely discussed in the clinical literature. Sialorrhea can occur with various neurologic disorders, infections, the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, heavy metal poisoning, Wilson disease, Angelman syndrome, as well as a relatively unknown condition called idiopathic paroxysmal sialorrhea. Normal salivation may be altered by drugs (such as clozapine, risperidone, nitrazepam, lithium, and bethanecol) that have a cholinergic effect that induces sialorrhea. This report focuses on sialorrhea as it relates to disorders of the oropharynx and esophagus. The patient typically recognizes a problem with excessive \"foamy mucus\" but does not understand its origin. Infections and obstruction are the most common oropharyngeal causes. Increased salivary flow occurs as a typically subtle manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease. This occurrence is referred to as water brash. Idiopathic achalasia and megaesophagus due to the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are regularly associated with sialorrhea. Esophageal obstruction (foreign body, cancer, or stricture formation), infection, and nasogastric intubation are the more common conditions associated with the symptomatic sequelae of sialorrhea. Sialorrhea-related respiratory and pulmonary complications are greatest in those with a diminished sensation of salivary flow and hypopharyngeal retention. Extremes of age, the chronically debilitated, or those in chronic care facilities, especially associated with cerebrovascular accidents and esophageal cancer, typically comprise this population. For the patient with an intact awareness of saliva, sialorrhea can present with significant social stigmas. Occult drooling or regular oral evacuation into a tissue or \"spit cup\" is socially incapacitating. This report provides a review of the physiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and therapeutic options for sialorrhea. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should recognize the importance of sialorrhea as a possible indicator or complication of a variety of disease states of the oropharynx and esophagus as well as its impact on the patient's physical and social quality of life.",

      "title": "Overview of Psychiatric Symptoms and Syndromes",
      "abstract": "This chapter provides an overview of psychiatric symptoms and syndromes that can be seen with neurologic diseases. Our goal is not to discuss every psychiatric disorder that might occur but to focus on those that are the most common. Important characteristics of this condition include: • Intermittently sad mood • Identifiable precipitant • Absence of major depression Just as grief is a normal response to loss, demoralization is a normal response to adversity. When bad things happen, our spirits fall. Because adversity is common with neurologic diseases, so is demoralization. Thus, patients may become demoralized when they learn they have a neurologic disease (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease), when they experience the symptoms of such a disease (eg, blindness, aphasia, pain), or when they develop the side effects of treatment for the disease (eg, weight gain from prednisone, dyskinesias from levodopa). Demoralization is not linked to any particular group of neurologic diseases, but it tends to be more common in those that are chronic, progressive, painful, debilitating, or disfiguring. Demoralized patients are almost always sad, but they may also be frustrated, irritable, pessimistic, or anxious. These unpleasant emotions are directly related to the patient’s situation and diminish as that situation improves. Someone who is demoralized by pain cheers up when the pain is relieved. Even when patients are demoralized by circumstances that cannot be reversed, their mood often improves when they discover that they are not powerless in the face of adversity. In this way, patients who become demoralized when they are told that they have a terminal illness may feel better as they start to focus on what they can do with the time left to them, and patients who become demoralized by the onset of a paraplegia may brighten as they begin to make progress in rehabilitation. This direct relationship between the patient’s mood and his or her situation helps distinguish the sadness of demoralization from that of major depression, because in the latter condition the patient’s mood remains low despite improving circumstances. Other features of a demoralized state also help differentiate demoralization from major depression.",

      "abstract": "Various circumstances of the injury lead to various types of brain damage. The main types of destructive effects are countracoup effect and acceleration/deceleration. The high intensity injuring force creates conditions for occurrence of combinations of different types of damage leading to aggravation of pathological processes caused by trauma, complication of clinical picture, difficulties of diagnosis and treatment, prolongation of hospital stay, and requires an additional methods of research and treating the injured. Finding the genesis of symptoms observed upon neurologic examination, and especially the differential diagnosis between primary and secondary lesions of the brain stem are nessesary to choose the emergency care for victims with severe traumatic brain injury, as well as to forecast the outcomes of treatment. The dynamics of neurological symptoms (level of wakefulness, pupil size, eyeball mobility, muscle tone and limb movement disorders, pathological plantar reflexes) have significant differences in patients with various types of brain damage, which makes a regular assessment of neurological status extremely important in these patients.",

      "title": "Fatigue is part of the burden of neuromuscular diseases",
      "abstract": "Patients with neuromuscular diseases ask relatively simple questions. They want a timely diagnosis, and information about prognosis and effects of disease on their personal functional status. With respect to treatment, patients long for a cure but most understand that they will have to reconcile to rehabilitation or even palliative treatment.\r\n\r\nWith respect to diagnosis, neurologists are trained to detect impairments, neurological signs and symptoms such as motor weakness using the MRC scale, or a Babinski sign. Also, though usually not in a structured way neurologists try to evaluate disability, such as not being able to go up the stairs or cycling. Functional status may be measured with the sickness impact profile (SIP) or the modified Rankin scale. Finally effects of disease on participation, for example not being able to work or taking part in sports, and on perceived health will be estimated. Measures of disability, participation and perceived health are increasingly being used as outcome measures in clinical trials [1].\r\n\r\nFatigue may be another underestimated symptom of neuromuscular disease [2]. That can be explained by ignorance as most patients with the exception of patients with myasthenia gravis or myotonic dystrophy do not spontaneously complain of fatigue. Many severely handicapped neuromuscular patients keep trying to participate in social life and work. In contrast, patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome have no or little objective signs and maximal decrease of participation and perceived health [2]. Yet, if fatigue would be a common additional feature of neuromuscular diseases, neurologists must be aware in order to better comprehend their patients and to develop new treatment strategies.\r\n\r\nThis issue of the Journal of Neurology contains two papers on fatigue in hereditary neuromuscular diseases. Dr. Hagemans did a cross-sectional study using a questionnaire with the Fatigue Severity Scale in 225 patients with late-onset Pompe disease [3]. About 67% had severe fatigue. Possible confounding factors were wheelchair dependency and respiratory support in about half of the patients, but 59% of patients without these aids also had severe fatigue. Previously this group investigated quality of life in lateonset Pompe patients using the SF-36 [4]. Interestingly, they found that these patients score only slightly lower than the general population on the mental health domains, making depression or decreased vitality as explanations for fatigue unlikely [3, 4]. The second paper shows that fatigue and pain can be relevant symptoms in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) [5]. Both groups suggest that fatigue is probably underreported in these slowly progressive neuromuscular diseases.\r\n\r\nSome caution with the role of confounding factors seems justified. The question whether patients with late onset Pompe disease and no respiratory aid have respiratory insufficiency that explains fatigue, can only be answered by actually measuring pulmonary function. In FSHD impaired shoulder function that is difficult to quantify, will affect quality of life and could explain fatigue.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the notion that fatigue may be part of the phenotype of neuromuscular disease is important. To my opinion, the wear and tear from having to live a life long with the consequences of a neuromuscular disease may be one explanation for fatigue. Severe fatigue will affect participation and perceived health. Neurologists must learn to measure fatigue during history taking. Neurologists can also develop interventions. For instance, it has recently been demonstrated that simple bicycle exercise training may help to decrease fatigue in patients following Guillain-Barre syndrome [6].",

      "title": "AFFECTIVE DISORDERS IN THE ELDERLY: DIAGNOSTIC AND RESEARCH CONSIDERATIONS",
      "abstract": "Although depressive disorders in the elderly represent a major public health concern by virtue of their high cost in human suffering, disability, and potential suicide, they have not been studied extensively, and specific criteria for diagnostic classification and optimal treatment are lacking. It seems likely that many of the affective syndromes in the elderly like senile melancholia, manic depressive illness, pseudodementia, and masked depression belong to the group of endogenous depressions, and can be identified by a constellation of clinical symptoms (endogenous or endogenomorphic profile), abnormal dexamethasone suppression test (DST) (at least 50%), and positive response to treatment with antidepressant medication. The rest are depressions reactive to psychogenic or sociogenic factors frequently presenting agitation as a dominant symptom, and finally there is a group of organic depressions due to underlying organic brain change, (i.e. senile dementia). It is possible that careful psychometric and psychiatric evaluation based on the symptom pattern, DST, and response to treatment would reveal reliable differences between pseudodementia and mild dementia and distinguish endogenomorphic from non-endogenomorphic depressions, respectively. The validity of such an approach remains to be demonstrated. Biological research in this area has provided valuable findings and should be the aim for the 1980s.",

      "title": "The 4I Hypothesis: A Neuro-Immunological Explanation for Characteristic Symptoms of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Characteristic symptoms of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) are (muscle) weakness, muscle pain, cognitive deficits, neurological abnormalities, but above all post-exertional malaise: a long-lasting increase of symptoms after a minor exertion. In contrast, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is primarily defined by 鈥渃hronic fatigue鈥? Since 鈥渃hronic fatigue鈥?is not mandatory for the diagnosis ME, and post-exertional malaise and cognitive deficits are not obligatory for the diagnosis CFS, the case criteria for ME and CFS define two distinct, partly overlapping nosological entities. ME and CFS are considered to be enigmatic diseases, qualified by some authors as 鈥渕edically unexplained syndromes鈥?of 鈥渇unctional syndromes鈥? However, specific abnormalities consistently observed over the years and their direct and indirect sequels can plausibly explain characteristic symptoms, e.g. 鈥渆xhaustion鈥?and pain. Abnormalities established repetitively incorporate immunological aberrations (inflammation, immune activation, immunosuppression, and immune dysfunction), persistent and/or reactivating infections, gastro-intestinal dysbiosis, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, a (prolonged) deviant response to exertion and orthostatic stress, circulatory deficits, and neurological abnormalities.This article depicts the 4I hypothesis, an explanatory model for ME (CFS) with a central role for four types of immunological abnormalities: inflammation, (Th2-predominated) immune activation, immunosuppression, and immune dysfunction. The potential direct sequels of these abnormalities, e.g. increased oxidative and nitrosative stress, (reactivating or chronic) infections, and their possible indirect consequences, e.g. mitochondrial dysfunction, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) axis hypofunction, and cardiovascular dysregulation, can plausibly explain various distinctive symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g. 鈥渆xhaustion鈥? (muscle) weakness, pain, cognitive deficits, a flu-like feeling, and post-exertional 鈥渕alaise鈥?",

      "abstract": "Complementary Therapies in Neurology: An Evidence-Based Approach Edited by Barry S.Oken ISBN 1-84214-200-3 Copyright © 2004 by The Parthenon Publishing Group, LondonDementia is a common age-associated condition increasing in prevalence from about 1% at age 65 to over 50% above age 90. Dementia has many causes, some of which are easily treated (e.g. metabolic disturbances such as thyroid disease), while others have no treatments with a clear disease-modifying effect, such as the primary central nervous system degenerations1. The most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia and these will be the only two specific diseases in addition to the non-specific dementia syndrome discussed in this chapter; other dementia syndromes are not discussed because of the lack of specific data relevant to this chapter. The clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease is considered the time point at which there are signs of cognitive dysfunction in at least two domains of cognition (e.g. memory, attention, language, visuospatial function and 'frontal lobe' function) and the cognitive dysfunction is causing problems with daily social or occupational function. Before the cognitive deficits become so problematic, there is a period when the person may have some complaints of memory loss and objective deficits in memory or other cognitive domains but has no change in more than one domain and no change in daily function. This is considered mild cognitive impairment (MCI), although there are a host of other terms for closely related conditions (e.g. age-associated memory impairment). About 50% of people with MCI may go on to develop overt Alzheimer's disease over a 5-year period2. There is also a period even prior to the onset of MCI when there is accumulating pathology in the brain and there is possible subtle cognitive change. While this chapter does not review treatments for this latter class of individuals (basically all middle-aged adults), a significant proportion of the population believes that some dietary supplements may impact aging. A Harris poll of 1010 people in the USA found that 78% of the respondents felt that vitamin supplements would provide some or a great deal of help in generally healthy people in growing old and 58% felt the same way about herbs or herbal products3. There is a high use of dietary supplements including vitamins in the aging population. Even in healthy people over the age of 85 years, 25% take vitamin C supplements, 25% vitamin E supplements and 10% Ginkgo biloba extract4.",

The list of possibilities spans virtually every major area of medicine, neurology and psychiatry. A clear, detailed history is invaluable in negotiating these numerous diagnostic considerations; however, the symptom may be expressed in terms that do not directly denote somnolence (e.g. `tiredness' or `fatigue'). Accurate diagnosis is important, not only because of the negative impacts of sleepiness and its root causes on health and social function, but because excessive sleepiness is generally remediable with appropriate treatment. As our understanding of the neurological underpinnings of alertness and sleepiness deepens, improved treatment methods are bound to emerge.",

In neurobiological terms, consciousness may be viewed as having an arousal dimension and an awareness dimension phenotypically expressed as the capacity to respond to self or environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness is associated with lesions that disrupt neuronal systems in the brainstem and diencephalon that mediate arousal or thalamocortical or corticocortical systems that mediate awareness. As there are many causes of unconsciousness, a timely and focused history and neurologic examination are critical to defining the differential diagnosis.",

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

This review shows that: (1) SD patients have apraxia of tool use because of semantic tool knowledge deficits, but normal performance in tests of physical understanding; (2) AD and CBS patients show impaired performance in mechanical problem-solving tests, probably not because of intrinsic deficits of physical understanding, but rather because of additional cognitive (AD) or motor impairments (CBS); (3) As a result, the performance in mechanical problem-solving tests is not a good predictor of familiar tool use in dementia; (4) Actual deficits of physical understanding are probably observed only in late stages of neurodegenerative diseases, and associated with functional loss.",

      "abstract": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by prolonged impairment of consciousness of variable entity, often associated with myoclonias or automatisms. EEG shows continuous paroxysmal activity or electrographic discharges. When NCSE occurs in older patients, differential diagnosis with other conditions such as stroke or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, may be difficult and a high degree of suspicion is required. Emergency EEG represents the most important means of investigation in such cases. According to ictal EEG, NCSE may be classified as generalized (including typical and “de novo” absence status) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Absence status, or ‘petit mal’ status, is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It can occur in the context of different types of generalized idiopathic epilepsies, or ‘de novo’, with onset usually in the elderly, precipitated by toxic or metabolic factors in subjects with no previous history of epilepsy [1]. Ictal EEG shows continuous or almost continuous generalized spike and polyspike and wave discharges. Clinical and EEG normalization occurs after i.v. benzodiazepines (BDZ) in most cases. The prognosis of “de novo” absence status is generally good and recurrences are rare [1]. In CPSE, impairment of consciousness may be continuous or fluctuating, but it is usually clinically very difficult to distinguish from absence status. CPSE may occur in patients with preexisting epilepsy, at times precipitated by AEDs withdrawal, or in subjects with acute or remote cerebral lesions. Ictal EEG shows continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. CPSE tends to recur and may be difficult to treat (response to i.v. BDZ in ~ 60% of patients) [2]. Cognitive and behavioral sequelae have been rarely reported, thus prompting an early recognition and treatment of such a condition. Mortality is also rare, mostly depending on etiology, but may reach up to 26,3% in the elderly. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively [3].",

Deux elements y concourent : la difficile appreciation des fluctuations cognitives, elements cles du diagnostic, et de la faible frequence de conjonction des trois criteres principaux qui semble liee a la presence d’une pathologie de type Alzheimer associee. Les criteres proposes pour un diagnostic de DCL probable sont : 1) la presence des trois signes majeurs : fluctuations cognitives avec des variations prononcees de l’attention et de la vigilance ; hallucinations visuelles recurrentes et detaillees ; presence de signes parkinsoniens spontanes ; 2) la presence de 1 ou plus des signes majeurs s’il existe 1 ou plus signes suggestifs. Le diagnostic de DCL possible peut etre porte chez un sujet dement, en l’absence de signes majeurs, devant 1 ou plus des signes suggestifs suivants : 1) troubles du sommeil paradoxal que traduit une agitation nocturne (les patients « agissent leurs reves ») ; 2) severe sensibilite aux neuroleptiques ; 3) mise en evidence d’un deficit dopaminergique dans les noyaux gris par la tomoscinigraphie. D’autres signes sont communs mais manquent de specificite : 1) signes de dysautonomie : hypotension orthostatique, chutes ou syncopes, instabilite neurocardiovasculaire, incontinence urinaire, impuissance, constipation ; 2) delire systematise ; 3) hallucinations autres que visuelles ; 4) depression ; 5) relative preservation des structures temporales internes en IRM ; 6) ralentissement diffus a l’EEG ; 7) hypoperfusion cerebrale generalisee, notamment dans les regions occipitales. Au plan neuropsychologique, la differenciation avec la MA repose sur une double dissociation : dans la DCL, la preservation relative de la denomination, du rappel a court et moyen terme comme de la reconnaissance contraste avec l’alteration de la fluence verbale, de la perception visuelle et des performances visuospatiales. Pour diminuer les difficultes d’appreciation des fluctuations, les auteurs recommandent d’utiliser les echelles de fluctuations cognitives proposees par Walker et al. [2] (la Clinician assessment of fluctuation scale necessite toutefois une plus grande expertise que la One day fluctuation assessement scale) ou la Mayo fluctuations composite scale pour differencier les fluctuations de la DCL de celles qui sont observees dans la MA [3]. Les criteres histopathologiques sont precises, notamment la quantification des lesions de type Alzheimer. L’article se conclut sur l’interet d’un traitement combine par les inhibiteurs de la cholinesterase et les dopaminergiques [4]. Quant a la question des rapports entre demence parkinsonienne (definie par l’apparition d’une demence chez un parkinsonien de longue date) et la DC (dans laquelle les signes parkinsoniens ne doivent pas avoir precede la demence de plus de 1 an), le consortium considere que cette distinction doit etre maintenue pour des raisons cliniques, mais qu’au niveau de la recherche, clinicopathologique ou therapeutique, les deux phenotypes peuvent etre reunis sous le terme de maladie a corps de Lewy ou alpha-synucleinopathie ! 1. McKeith IG, Dickson DW, Lowe J, Emre M, O’Brien JT, Feldman H, et al.

      "abstract": "Requests for neuropsychiatric consultations are usually for one of three reasons. The first is when patients present with neurological symptoms but no organic cause can be found and the features do not fit with a known neurological illness. Symptoms include convulsions, disordered movement such as apparent dystonia, paralysis or tremor, sensory disturbance, amnesia, blindness and dysphonia. The second type of request is for assessment of psychiatric symptoms in the context of a known neurological disorder. The third type of request is when patients develop prominent psychiatric symptoms but there is concern that these are the product of an underlying neurological process. Psychiatric symptoms are also very common in multiple sclerosis (MS) and take the form of depression, agitation, anxiety and irritability. In adrenoleukodystrophy, dementia, learning difficulties and behaviour changes are the most frequent presenting psychiatric problems but again schizophrenia-like states have been reported.",

      "title": "Exploring the connection between sleep disorders and neurological diseases: implications for diagnosis and management",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital and complex physiological process which is critical to maintain normal functioning of the nervous system1. Research suggests that lack of sleep or sleep disorders increase the risk of several health issues including hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, depression, and obesity1. In this article, we aim to discover the relationship between sleep disorders and neurological diseases and its implications for diagnosis and management. Sleep disorders have been shown to have an impact on several neurological diseases. Poor sleep can increase the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), multiple sclerosis, and Huntington disease2. Moreover, sleep disorders have also been shown to have an impact on increasing the risk of stroke, epilepsy, and affecting cognitive function such as learning and memory. Furthermore, autism spectrum disorder and neuropathic pain have also shown to have an association with sleep disorders2. Just like sleep disorders have a negative impact on the nervous system, some neurological diseases can affect the sleeping patterns of an individual. A few central nervous system conditions have been shown to cause sleep apnea which results in a disturbed circadian rhythm resulting in difficulty sleeping at night. Over 50% of patients with a history of stroke have reported of sleeping problems. Moreover, AD and PD have also been shown to have an association with poor sleep3. Establishing a robust diagnosis of sleep disorders in patients with neurological diseases can prove to be challenging due to overlap in symptoms which may lead to misdiagnosis. The current gold standard test for diagnosing sleeping disorders is polysomnography4. Other tests include: lab testing to screen for stimulants or other medications which may increase the level of alertness and disturb sleep; Multiple Sleep Latency Test to determine the degree of sleepiness; Maintenance of Wakefulness Test to test for the ability of staying awake; and actigraphy which includes the use of a device worn on the writs which provides data regarding periods of rest and/or sleep activities5. Even though these tests are accurate per se, there are always certain limitations. In order to understand the complex relationship between neurological diseases and sleep disorders, there is a need for emerging diagnostic technologies to improve accuracy which is critical for providing an early intervention and improving patient outcomes. Treating sleep disorders among patients with underlying neurological disorders can also be arduous, given the complex nature of the relationship between the two. Therapies targeted toward treating sleep disorders include light therapy, orofacial therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). In addition, medical management includes the use of medications such as benzodiazepines (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone), melatonin receptor agonists (eg, ramelteon), and orexin receptor antagonists (eg, suvorexant)6. Furthermore, continuous positive airway pressure has shown promising results in improving sleep among patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea7. Although the discussed managements and treatments are excellent for treating sleep disorders, there still remains a lack of literature in the management and treatment for sleeping disorders among those with underlying neurological disorders. Thus, there is a need for more targeted therapies which take account of the underlying mechanisms of sleep disorders and neurological diseases. Collaboration between neurologists and sleep specialists is crucial to enhance the identification and early intervention of sleep disorder and neurological diseases. It is also imperative for primary care physicians to have a strong understanding of sleep abnormalities in patients with neurological conditions. These physicians can screen patients for sleep disorders and refer them so specialists for further evaluation and treatment, which will provide appropriate care to the patients and improve outcomes. Moreover, educating the patients regarding importance of sleep and their beneficial effects on neurological health is essential. The combined effort of patients and their health care professionals will provide a more comprehensive care for those suffering with neurological diseases and sleep disorders. To conclude, sleep is crucial for optimal functioning of the nervous system and research has shown that sleep disorders increase the likelihood of several health issues. The relationship between sleep disorders and neurological disorders in complex making appropriate diagnosis and treatment challenging. Poor sleep has been linked to various neurological diseases including AD, PD, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington disease. Establishing an accurate diagnosis of sleep disorders in patients with neurological disease is necessary for early intervention and improved outcomes. Moreover, targeted therapies that consider the underlying disease mechanisms of sleep disorders and neurological are needed to improve management and treatment of these patients. Collaboration between neurologists, sleep specialists, and primary care physicians is necessary for better identifications and treatment of sleep disorders in patients with underlying neurological conditions. Lastly, educating the patients regarding the importance of sleep and encouraging a combined effort between patients and health care providers will provide a more comprehensive care for those with neurological diseases and sleep disorders.

      "title": "Functional testing",
      "abstract": "Functional testing is useful to monitor the natural history of several neuromuscular disorders, and to measure the efficacy of therapeutic agents in clinical trials. A major limitation of functional testing is that a single test is often not appropriate throughout all stages of disease. The same limitation holds true for other measurements of disease progression. MMT and quantitative myometry become technically difficult to perform and lack sensitivity to disease progression at some stages in the course of DMD, ALS, and spinal muscular atrophy. Other limitations of functional testing are its lack of sensitivity to detect a subtle improvement or decline in muscle strength, and the difficulty of applying standard statistical methods to analyze disease progression or therapeutic efficacy. The advantages of functional testing outweigh the limitations. Function testing uses daily activities to monitor disease progression. Patient's appreciate improvements in function more readily than improvements in muscle strength. Functional testing is easily standardized and is reliable. It can be performed, with little or no expense, in almost any clinical setting. The primary challenge for investigators who wish to incorporate functional tests is to identify functional tests that best measure the natural history of the specific disease under investigation. Further, functional testing allows the clinician to provide an educated guess on the likely future course of disease.",

      "title": "Atypical presentation of acute idiopathic megacolon in a 14-year-old patient",
      "abstract": "In clinical practice the term &ldquo;megacolon&rdquo; is used to indicate a marked dilatation of the cecum and the sigmoid colon (&gt;12 and 6.5 cm, respectively) (1). From a clinical standpoint, a megacolon can be classified as chronic or acute depending on its clinical presentation. Chronic megacolon typically refers to a congenital disorder in which the enteric nervous system (ENS) supplying the colon does not develop properly, thereby leaving the distal segments of the viscus without myenteric and submucosal ganglia (i.e. Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease) (2). Other cases of non-aganglionic chronic megacolon can be secondary to variety of conditions such as Chagas&rsquo; disease and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s diseases), leading to or associated with ENS abnormalities (3). The acute form of megacolon, also referred to as Ogilvie&rsquo;s syndrome, is characterized by a predominant involvement of the cecum and right colon usually affecting elderly patients undergoing surgery (e.g. orthopedic procedures) or taking medications altering gut motility (e.g. opioids or antidepressants) (4). Some forms of acute megacolon, however, can be idiopathic in origin since no underlying etiology can be identified. Patients with acute idiopathic megacolon usually have a longstanding history of constipation, often accompanied by laxative abuse, and their clinical presentation is characterized by abdominal distension and severe pain with radiological evidence of stool impacted in the colon and rectum (1, 4). The case herein reported represents an unusual form of acute idiopathic megacolon characterized by massive descending and sigmoid colon distension complicated with a volvulus in a 14-year-old boy with no Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease. In addition, just to increase the peculiarity of this case report, the patient had an unremarkable clinical record, and never suffered from chronic constipation in the past.",

Im Zuge des Fortschreitens der Krankheitssymptome erfahren die MS-Patienten eine zunehmende Bewegungseinschränkung, die meist eine Abhängigkeit von Hilfsmitteln hervorruft. Für die MS-Betroffenen bedeutet dies einerseits eine schnellere Ermüdung im Alltag, anderseits besteht die Gefahr, dass die klinischen Auswirkungen vorhandener degenerativer kardiovaskulärer Veränderungen verstärkt werden. Neben den physischen Einschränkungen treten auch psychische Symptome bei MS-Erkrankten im Verlauf zunehmend auf. Als häufigste affektive Störung bei der MS ist die Depression zu nennen. Diese zahlreichen psychischen Symptome, aber auch die physischen Symptome der MS, bieten einen guten Ansatzpunkt für eine sporttherapeutische Intervention wie sie in der vorliegenden Studie im Rahmen eines Ergometertrainings durchgeführt wurde.",

These proposed neuropsychiatric syndromes are rarely syndromes and the symptoms are rarely neuropsychiatric. It is better first of all to determine whether the SLE patients have neurological or psychiatric symptoms, and if these symptoms are present, the first question is what is the cause. Vasculitis of the cerebral blood vessels should be considered as a possible explanation only if ischaemic lesions in the brain have been demonstrated, other causes of cerebral ischaemia in SLE are unlikely, and the clinical signs are consistent with cerebral vasculitis. These other causes of cerebral ischaemia include: antiphospholipid antibodies, atherosclerosis, heart valve disorders and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.",

      "abstract": "The formulation of a diagnosis in a child who has neurologic impairment should not (except in extreme circumstances) be made on the basis of a single finding. For example, the presence of delayed milestones, primitive or exaggerated reflexes, abnormal muscle tone, abnormal posture, abnormal neurologic examination, and temporal course should all be used to make the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Furthermore, because each condition has a spectrum of disabilities from mild to severe involvement, determination of the child's abilities and impairments should be part of the diagnostic process. Because the child lives in a number of different environments, assessment of the child's functional abilities and evaluation of the environments should be made. Finally, evaluations by specialists in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychology, special education, and nutrition may be necessary to complete the child's diagnosis. The ability to examine the child over a period of time (i.e., continuity of care) allows the practitioner to provide a more accurate prognosis for future development. It also enables easier diagnosis of the child when he or she is acutely ill. This also allows a more trusting relationship to develop with the parent and enhances the ability to influence the psychosocial conditions that affect outcomes. Finally, all these children should have care coordination (case management) (i.e., someone who can ensure that they receive the care they need, without duplication) across all settings, including home, school, hospitals, and ambulatory facilities.",

Investigations to determine whether there might have been some injury causing brain damage reveal nothing. The child had a normal, full-term birth, with no resuscitation necessary. His psychomotor development was physiologically normal and without complications. His intelligence and scholastic achievements are normal. The most extensive tests always give negative results. Only the electroencephalogram (EEG) may show disturbance, but not always. Typical losses of consciousness are reflected the EEG if it is a case of petit mal. But these EEG tracings, whether recorded during or between seizures, give no clues whatever to etiology. The child or adolescent is then treated symptomatically. He will be re-examined later. The subsequent course varies. Sometimes seizures or blackouts cease under the effects of treatment. In other cases, new seizures occur at more or less long intervals, so that treatment must be modified or intensified. The patient will never, throughout his life, provide concrete evidence of any organic damage. This person is then classified as epileptic; and view of the absence of any discernible lesion as cause, the term is qualified by essential or idiopathic.

      "abstract": "У статті описано, що найпоширенішими порушеннями діяльності вищої нервової системи є невротичні розлади, які пов’язують з різними факторами, включаючи недостатню пристосованість організму людей до сучасного рівня науково-технічного прогресу, і мають вплив на ефективність функціонування та існування людини, її внутрішню рівновагу та взаємодію зі світом. Зокрема, невротичні розлади суттєво погіршують якість життя людини, обмежують її можливості, спричиняють ризик розвитку інших психічних та фізичних захворювань і у випадку недостатнього лікування можуть призвести до серйозних наслідків, включаючи самогубство. Доведено, що причинами невротичних розладів уважаються психічні травми та невротичні конфлікти, що викликають реакції стресу і дистресу, внаслідок чого відбувається дезорганізація організму (неадекватні, неспецифічні реакції) на всіх рівнях (фізіологічному, психологічному, поведінковому), що призводить до психосоматичних порушень і навіть захворювань. У статті висвітлено два види соціально-психологічної адаптації: прогресивний, який забезпечує реалізацію узгодженості інтересів і цілей індивідів і груп суспільства; регресивний, що постає як формальне пристосування, несумісне з інтересами суспільства і розвитком цієї соціальної групи і самої особистості. Представлені результати емпіричного дослідження прояву невротизації особистості: виявлено, що в 19% респондентів спостерігається низький рівень прояву невротизації, у 40% – середній рівень і ще у 41% – високий. Тобто можна зробити висновок, що 81% студентів мають підвищений або високий рівень невротизації, що впливає на якість їхнього життя та здоров’я. Запропоновані підходи до лікування передбачають поєднання терапії, медикаментів і підтримки для вирішення як соціально-психологічних, так і невротичних аспектів, спрямованих на покращення загального благополуччя та адаптивного функціонування.",

Symptoms of Alzheimer's disease can be reduced by drugs (Tacrine) to help improve an individual's quality of life.

Numerosas alteraciones metabolicas pueden ser responsables de los trastornos de la conciencia en el postoperatorio, aunque la mayoria no surgen de forma espontanea en el intraoperatorio(2,3). Por ello, una exploracion neurologica superficial es obligada en todo paciente que ingresa y egresa de sala de quirofano, y una determinacion de parametros bioquimicos puede ser necesaria (examenes de laboratorio), asi como la revision detallada de los antecedentes personales y de los acontecimientos intraoperatorios, siempre que no exista un suceso que justifique el problema. La disfuncion cognitiva postoperatoria es un sindrome especifico conocido, con una incidencia que oscila en forma muy variada; segun las diferentes estadisticas, se encuentra entre 0% hasta 79% dependiendo de multiples variables como son el tipo de cirugia, periodo estudiado, poblacion y tipo de test psicologico que se haya implementado. Dado que el deficit cognitivo puede acompanarse de aumento de la morbilidad, sus repercusiones sobre la estadia en el hospital y el costo por paciente pueden ser importantes(4-6). El MMS fue desarrollado por Folstein, et al. (1975) como un metodo practico para facilitar al clinico el graduar el estado cognoscitivo del paciente y poder detectar demencia o delirium. El MMS evalua la orientacion espacial y temporal, el recuerdo inmediato (fijacion), la memoria a medio termino y habilidades de sustraccion serial o el deletreo hacia atras. Tambien mide capacidades constructivas (la habilidad de copiar una figura de Bender), y el uso del lenguaje. La puntuacion total se obtiene sumando los puntos alcanzados en cada tarea y puede ir de 0 a 30(7-9). Una puntuacion entre 27 y 30 puntos se considera normal, de 25 o 26 indica sospecha patologica, de 12 a 24 se considera como deterioro, mientras que una puntuacion de 9 a 12 indica demencia.",

      "title": "Depression and multiple sclerosis: a potential way to understand the biology of major depressive illness",
      "abstract": "It has long been known that a variety of medical disorders may present with depressive symptoms or syndromes and that depression may influence the course of medical disorders. For example, depression is a risk factor for ischemic heart disease and may also influence prognosis after acute myocardial infarction. Moreover, various endocrine disorders, particularly thyroid disease and especially hypothyroidism and diseases of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, may be associated with a wide range of psychiatric symptoms and, more particularly, depression. These observations have provided an opportunity to use medical illnesses to understand the pathophysiology of primary depressive illness. The association of multiple sclerosis and depressive symptoms and disorders may provide yet another opportunity and should not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nMultiple sclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system. The disorder is one of the most common neurologic disorders to affect young adults and, although its cause is not fully understood, it appears to involve a complex interplay of genetic, environmental and immunologic factors.1 Several studies have documented an increased prevalence of lifetime diagnoses of major depressive disorder in patients with multiple sclerosis. Recently, a large-scale community epidemiologic study reported that about 40% of subjects had clinical depressive symptoms.2 This is consistent with numerous earlier studies conducted largely in specialty clinics that have reported a lifetime risk of major depression of 25%–50% in patients with multiple sclerosis.2 Moreover, Feinstein3 reported a substantially higher risk of suicidal behaviour in patients with multiple sclerosis that is consistent with the high risk for major depression. Whether the occurrence or the severity of depressive symptoms are related to the severity of multiple sclerosis or the degree of disability still remains a controversial issue; however, the high co-occurrence of multiple sclerosis and depression is impressive.\r\n\r\nThere are several analogous features to these 2 disorders that are intriguing. The first, beside the obvious fact that both are disorders of the central nervous system, is that both have multifactorial causes, which involve the interplay of complex genetic and environmental factors. Second, both illnesses have a chronic and/or relapsing course. Third, stressful life events are moderately associated with both exacerbations of multiple sclerosis and episodes of recurrence in major depressive disorder. Last, immune phenomena may be involved in the biologic underpinnings of both these disorders. In both animal models and humans, certain T-cell responses activated by specific myelin antigens have been implicated in the cause of multiple sclerosis.4 The proinflammatory cytokine, interferon-γ, which is produced by T cells, is a major effector mechanism in the autoimmune process leading to the pathogenesis of the disorder.4 Depression has been associated with both increases in interferon-γ as well as in the subclasses of T cells involved in multiple sclerosis.5 Therefore, autoimmune phenomena may be one of the underlying factors linking depression to multiple sclerosis. The immune phenomena associated with depression may, in fact, exacerbate multiple sclerosis or they may be causative mechanisms common to both illnesses.4,5,6 Consistent with the former notion is the fact that successful treatment of depression is associated with suppression of both nonspecific and antigen-specific T-cell responses in multiple sclerosis.\r\n\r\nThe depression associated with multiple sclerosis is amenable to treatment both with psychotherapy as well as with antidepressants.7 At the very least, vigorous treatment of the depression may not only relieve current suffering and dysfunction but may also improve long-term prognosis for the depression and even the multiple sclerosis. This suggests that early psychiatric consultation and intervention should be the appropriate standard of care for patients with multiple sclerosis who have depressive symptoms or depressive disorders. However, the tantalizing suggestion of common biologic mechanisms indicates that the co-occurrence of these disorders may be fruitful in shedding light on our understanding of the pathogenesis of primary major depressive disorder.\r\n\r\nEarly observations, more than 100 years ago, of the link between adrenal and thyroid endocrinopathies and psychiatric illness has allowed major advances in our understanding of the biology of depressive disorders. Our discovering of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysregulation in depression has been important in understanding the biology of the disorder and may also yield potential new therapeutic interventions in the form of the corticotropin-releasing hormone antagonists. Further close study of patients with multiple sclerosis and their high depressive morbidity may be of substantial advantage not only to those patients who suffer an enormous burden of illness but also to depressed patients in psychiatric clinics, both in terms of understanding their illness and in developing new therapeutic options.",

Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

Here we relate experimental findings of fibromyalgia symptoms to anatomical and functional brain changes. Neuroimaging studies show augmented sensory processing in pain-related areas, which, together with gray matter decreases and neurochemical abnormalities in areas related to pain modulation, supports the psychophysical evidence of altered pain perception and inhibition. Gray matter decreases in areas related to emotional decision making and working memory suggest that cognitive disturbances could be related to brain alterations. Altered levels of neurotransmitters involved in sleep regulation link disordered sleep to neurochemical abnormalities. Thus, current evidence supports the view that at least some fibromyalgia symptoms are associated with brain dysfunctions or alterations, giving the long-held \"it is all in your head\" view of the disorder a new meaning.",

      "abstract": "No existe todavia un criterio claro que permita comprender y tratar la depresion que se desarrolla tras una lesion traumatica del cerebro (LTC), y se cree que puede ser el resultado de una serie de factores interactivos complejos. \nLos investigadores anteriores presentaron distintas vias para clasificar las principales variables en relacion con la depresion de los pacientes dentro de unos dominios mas amplios como podian ser: el estado general del cerebro antes de la lesion cerebral, la naturaleza y severidad de la lesion del cerebro, y la reaccion ante las dificultades. \nNo obstante, es imprescindible una conceptualizacion mas precisa del problema para conseguir controlar la importancia de la evaluacion y el tratamiento en los pacientes con depresion tras una lesion traumatica del cerebro.\nEl estudio que presentamos ofrece esta conceptualizacion mediante el postulado de seis relaciones teoricas entre la depresion y la LTC. Se indica tambien el grado de bases empiricas que aparecen en los estudios sobre este tipo de relaciones. Los resultados de las investigaciones sugieren que un individuo con LTC presenta una mayor susceptibilidad a la depresion cuando existe alguna de las condiciones siguientes: cuando se exacerba alguna perturbacion psiquiatrica pre-existente; cuando la lesion sufrida se situa en la region anterior izquierda del cerebro; y cuando el individuo presenta una percepcion pobre de sus propias deficiencias y pretende asumir de nuevo sus funciones de antes de la lesion y experimenta un fracaso considerable. Y cuando no se sigue el plan de tratamiento recomendado se puede predecir las consecuencias probables de cada una de esas relaciones. La conceptualizacion que se presenta seguidamente y las consideraciones sobre el tratamiento supondran un beneficio sustancial para los medicos que trabajan en esta area.",

Although there is growing awareness of the prevalence of cancer-related fatigue, there is very little scientific literature about the aetiology and natural history of this debilitating symptom, unlike other illnesses with associated fatigue such as multiple sclerosis and lupus erythematosus. Fatigue can be physical (e.g. associated with muscle weakness or lack of stamina), mental (including poor concentration and lack of motivation), or both. Fatigue can have adverse effects on cognitive function and mood.",

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis.

Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

An important portion of the history in a primary care evaluation is the psychiatric history and the mental status examination. When evaluating a patient for mental or emotional disorders, history is truly everything. Often, the practitioner must ask specific questions to assess the presence of common mental disorders in order to supplement other information or because the patient does not recognize or does not volunteer the symptoms. Casting ones net for the symptoms of common mental disorders, including the category of anxiety disorders, is extremely helpful to fully assess a patient’s emotional and physical status. Disorders that comorbidly occur may further complicate matters, especially if common symptoms are shared. For example, shared symptoms of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder include worrying, poor concentration, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and somatic concerns. An appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan can be instituted only after the clinical symptoms and signs are fully recognized and evaluated. The information in this book is applicable to evaluations of adult patients, age 18 years or older, although sections may be applicable to younger patients. The information is based on scholarly information supported by research and practical suggestions based on cumulative clinical experiences of the authors.",

Some have psychological problems or orthopaedic complaints and simple obesity is also more common in children with mild nonspecific mental retardation. Over time, children with simple obesity also develop the health consequences of severe obesity, but their lack of problems in early childhood is often remarkable. By contrast, children with ‘pathological’, secondary or endogenous obesity have obesity in association with a wide variety of other problems. Obesity is rarely their presenting problem. True secondary obesity currently accounts for only a small proportion (<5%) of cases of obesity. However developments in understanding of the genetics of obesity may change this in the future as specific diagnoses become possible for increasing numbers of previously ‘simple’ obesity cases (Farooqi & O'Rahilly, 2000).",

En ese sentido, muchas especialidades médicas pueden reclamar su relación con la Psiquiatría, puesto que son innumerables las enfermedades que tienen nexo con signos y síntomas psiquiátricos (por ejemplo, la enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal en Gastroenterología; el asma bronquial en Neumología, entre otras). No obstante, con la Dermatología la relación es mucho más evidente. La Psicodermatología es una especialidad que surge de la conjunción de dos ramas aparentemente divergentes de la Medicina: la Psiquiatría y la Dermatología. En Psicodermatología, algunos pacientes presentan enfermedades principalmente dermatológicas con comorbilidades psicosociales secundarias, mientras que otros tienen trastornos psiquiátricos primarios con sintomatología cutánea significativa. Así también, debido a que varias enfermedades dermatológicas no solo se acompañan frecuentemente de dolor e incomodidad, sino que son inmediatamente visibles para los demás, las personas afectadas por estas condiciones pueden sufrir consecuencias sociales y emocionales. Con base en lo anterior, este artículo de revisión presenta los conceptos, nosología y modelos de abordaje de esta ciencia médica, haciendo hincapié que, debido a la interacción permanente entre la mente y la piel, se hace necesario que el paciente sea tratado como una unidad constituida por varios niveles, incluyendo aspectos cutáneos, emocionales y mentales.",

      "title": "Delirium and Dementia",
      "abstract": "Emergency physicians are frequently presented with patients exhibiting neurobehavioral abnormalities. These can be a harbin­ ger of a serious medical condition, and critical decisions must be made expeditiously about diagnostic evaluation, therapeutic intervention, and disposition. The first critical action is to recog­ nize the presence of the neurobehavioral abnormality. The second is to distinguish delirium from dementia or some other neuropsy­ chiatric condition. In the past, terms such as acute confusional state, sundowning, and organic brain syndrome have been used to describe a host of abnormal cognitive states that can be observed in the emer­ gency setting. These terms have loosely defined a group of neurobehavioral disorders that are caused by a physiologic dis­ turbance. Organic brain syndrome is a nebulous term that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition, text revision) eschews because the “organic” connotation implies that so­called functional mental disorders are without a biologic basis. Several key features best distinguish delirium from dementia: the time course of disease evolution, the presence of autonomic system involvement, the level of consciousness, and the presence of an underlying disease processes. Delirium is characterized by a fluctuating level of neurobehavioral disturbance typically pro­ gressing during minutes to hours to days. Delirium is a direct consequence of an acute systemic or central nervous system (CNS) stressor. Dementia, on the other hand, tends to follow a more gradual course, with evolution during months to years. Although patients with dementia exhibit confusion, disturbance in level of consciousness usually is not a feature, and manifestations of auto­ nomic nervous system abnormalities are minimal or absent. The evaluation of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with a disturbance of neurobehavioral state is best conducted in accordance with the following basic guidelines: 1. The first step is to determine whether this state represents delirium or dementia. The clinical findings may be subtle, and establishment of the diagnosis can be challenging, especially because delirium may be superimposed on dementia and dementia remains an independent risk factor for delirium. Early symptoms and signs may go unrecognized unless an adequate history is obtained from the patient, family members, and caregivers. A careful examination must include memory and cognitive assessment with a mental status screening examination. 2. Supportive care must be provided. This care may range in extent from aggressive airway and cardiovascular support to pharmacologic or physical restraint to simply placing the patient in a quiet room with appropriate environmental support. 3. A diligent search must be initiated for the underlying precipitating stressors in patients presenting with delirium.",

La gravedad del deterioro y la variedad de sintomas asociados a los trastornos del neurodesarrollo o a sindromes epilepticos especificos reflejan disfunciones focales o globales, estructurales o funcionales de las redes neuronales. La compleja relacion entre los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y la epilepsia es de menor importancia que los factores comunes que incluyen la genetica, la cognicion, la funcion motora y del lenguaje. Las encefalopatias epilepticas estan asociadas a una regresion o una ralentizacion del funcionamiento cognitivo, del lenguaje o de la conducta, y la hipotesis de trabajo aceptada es que esta es una consecuencia directa de las crisis o de la actividad epileptiforme interictal, y no de la enfermedad asociada. Los datos que apoyan la idea de que las crisis recurrentes o la actividad electrica anomala pueden provocar alteraciones especificas cognitivas, del lenguaje o de la conducta, incluso en las encefalopatias epilepticas aceptadas, todavia son objeto de debate. Los datos procedentes de los estudios en animales y la experiencia clinica de las encefalopatias epilepticas de la juventud dan a entender que hay ventanas temporales del desarrollo que son cruciales para el tipo de sindrome epileptico y para el desenlace conductual y cognitivo.

      "title": "[Aging of memory mechanisms].",
      "abstract": "Human amnesia cases (after surgical removal of the hippocampi or brain anoxia) have clearly established the critical role of the hippocampal formation in anterograde amnesia. Other parts of the brain may also contribute to anterograde amnesia (mammillary bodies, medial thalamus). In neurodegenerative diseases (and specially in Alzheimer's disease) amnesia is often the prominent symptom, but the brain lesions are not restricted to the hippocampal formation. In Alzheimer's disease they involve also the cerebral cortex and several subcortical nuclei. Physiological brain aging is also associated with some degree of memory impairment, but much less severe than in Alzheimer's disease. The issue of the nature and the mechanisms of the memory impairment associated with age and with Alzheimer's disease is very important, because the frequency of these problems increases dramatically as the populations of the world is growing older. There is some evidence that neuronal loss and alterations in neurotransmitter systems occur in the aged subject, but the relationship between such changes and the age-related memory deficit is far from being clear. In Alzheimer's disease, the loss of memory is likely to be due to neuronal loss in cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation, along with alterations in neurotransmitter systems (specially cholinergic, monoaminergic and aminoacidergic systems). The work in experimental animals has largely confirmed the critical role of the hippocampal formation, as well as identified other critical structures. The mechanisms of the age-related memory impairment can be to some extent investigated in aged animals. In the aged rat there is evidence that several neurotransmitter networks are altered. Alteration in the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems have been extensively studied, but the involvement of other systems is likely. Learning and memory deficits are consistently observed in a sub-population of aged rodents (as well as in other species including non-human primates). For instance some aged rats do have a deficit in the performance of a spatial learning task such as the \"water maze\". There is some evidence that this deficit is due, at least in part, to alterations in the functions of the hippocampal formation. In other words, if aged rats have a spatial memory deficit, it might be due to changes in hippocampal neuronal circuitry. The study of age-related alterations in hippocampal neuronal networks, using electrophysiological techniques have shown that several neuronal properties such as resting membrane potential, membrane resistance or sodium spike amplitude are not altered in the aged rat hippocampus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

It is most often caused by a fracture, soft-tissue injury or surgical procedure and is divided into Type I, in which no nerve lesion is identified (classic reflex sympathetic dystrophy), and Type II where a specific nerve has been damaged (causalgia). In addition to the peripheral manifestations, there are many internal medical complications whose etiology is often not appreciated. This article will examine how CRPS affects the systems of: cognition; constitutional, cardiac, and respiratory complications; systemic autonomic dysregulation; neurogenic edema; musculoskeletal, endocrine and dermatological manifestations; as well as urological and gastrointestinal function.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

For example, a 75-year-old man who has become somewhat forgetful over the preceding year might be experiencing only a mild decline in memory function that is within expected limits for a person his age. Conversely, his forgetfulness might reflect the presence of a clinical entity such as a meningioma that has a potential for curative surgical intervention or a dementing disorder such as Dementia of the Alzheimer’s Type (DAT), which is inevitably progressive despite new medications that have become available in recent years. The practicing clinician must address the range of possibilities in each older adult who presents with possible cognitive decline.",

There was no relation between the clinicians’ diagnoses of depression and psychometric scores. Little relation was found between performance on the cognitive tests and the number of depressive features (maximum, 9) reported by the individual or collateral source. The few statistically significant (<i>P</i>&lt;.05) correlations were modest (≤0.21). <h3>Conclusion</h3> Depression does not worsen cognitive test performance beyond the effect of dementia.",

Dada la inespecificidad de los signos clínicos, la anamnesis y los test comportamentales han sido considerados como las principales herramientas diagnósticas para identificar este síndrome.

      "title": "How Anxiety Presents Differently in Older Adults: Age-Related Changes, Medical Comorbidities Alter Presentation and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Although anxiety disorders are common at all ages, there is a misconception that their prevalence drastically declines with age. For this reason anxiety disorders often are underdiagnosed and undertreated in geriatric patients, especially when the clinical presentation of these disorders in older patients differs from that seen in younger adults. In older persons, anxiety symptoms often overlap with medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism and geriatric patients tend to express anxiety symptoms as medical or somatic problems such as pain rather than as psychological distress. 1 As a result, older adults often seek treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms from their primary care physician instead of a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, primary care physicians often miss psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders, in geriatric patients. Anxiety may be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric disturbance, secondary to a general medical condition, or induced by dietary substances, substances of abuse, or medications. Late-life anxiety often is comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Box, page 66) and other psychological stressors as older adults recognize declining cognitive and physical functioning. (2) BOX Comorbid anxiety and depression: Highly prevalent, poorer outcomes The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam study--one of the largest epidemiologic studies to examine comorbidity of anxiety disorders and depression in patients age 55 to 85--found that 48% of older persons with primary major depressive disorder (MDD) also had a comorbid anxiety disorder, whereas approximately one-fourth of those with anxiety disorders also had MDD. (a) Pre-existing anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder, increase the risk of developing depression. Rates of comorbid anxiety and depression increase with age. (c) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Late-life MDD comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder is associated with greater memory decline than MDD alone. (d) In addition, comorbid anxiety and depression is associated with greater symptom severity and persistence, greater functional impairment, substance dependence, poorer compliance and response to treatment, worse overall prognosis and outcome than patients with either disorder alone, (e) and greater likelihood of suicidal ideation in older men. (f) Source: For reference citations, see this article at CurrentPsychiatry.com Anxiety disorders commonly begin in early adulthood, tend to be chronic and interspersed with remissions and relapses, and usually continue into old age. (3) In generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), there is a bimodal distribution of onset; approximately two-thirds of patients experience onset between the late teens and late 20s and one-third develop the disorder for the first time after age 50. (3) Prevalence rates for anxiety disorders among older adults (age >55) range from 3.5% to 10.2%.(4) These rates are slightly lower than those for younger adults. (5) Among older adults, presence of a 12-month anxiety disorder was associated with female sex, lower education, being unmarried, and having [grater than or equal to]3 or more chronic conditions. (6) Anxiety and disability risk Anxiety disorders affect geriatric patients more profoundly than their younger counterparts. Persons age >65 who have an anxiety disorder are 3 to 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than younger individuals. (1) Anxiety is associated with high rates of medically unexplained symptoms, increased use of health care resources, chronic medical illness, low levels of physical health-related quality of life, and physical disability. (7), (8) Anxiety symptoms may predict progressing physical disability among older women and reduced ability to perform activities of daily living over 1 year. …",

The disturbances of perception appear to be fundamental to the other aspects of the disease.

      "title": "The complex conundrum of geriatric depression and dementias",
      "abstract": "Late-life depression (LLD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia are clinically distinct yet interrelated disease constructs, wherein LLD can be a prodrome, risk factor, comorbidity, or consequence of MCI and dementia. There is considerable prevalence of depression in those with MCI or dementia, and vice versa, with maximum evidence in Alzheimer's disease. These intersections often form one of the most confusing aspects of psychogeriatric practice, leading to under-detection and mismanagement of depression, thus leading to incomplete recovery in most cases. This article focuses on this clinical ambiguity in daily practice, reviews the clinico-investigative pointers for the LLD–dementia intersection, and puts forward clinical and research recommendations in view of the available evidence. Although there is conflicting evidence regarding the cause–effect relationship between LLD, MCI, and dementia, it is likely that these constructs share some common pathological processes and are often associated with each other within a longitudinal clinical continuum. This is a linear yet complex bidirectional association: either the comorbid depression exaggerates preexisting cognitive deficits or chronic persistent depression eventually leads to major neurocognitive disorders, not to mention depression as a part of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, which often impairs quality of life and psychosocial morbidity. Thus, a comprehensive approach, including tailored history, neuropsychiatric examination, and relevant investigations, is necessary for assessing the differentials, with a sound clinical understanding being vital to the process. Depression, if suspected, must be treated adequately with longitudinal neuropsychological reviews. Future research warrants elucidating precision biomarkers unique to these clinicopathological entities.",

      "abstract": "This review focuses on the differentiation of schizophrenia in the setting of adult psychiatry from neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD's) and psychosis due to other medical conditions (PDMC). Psychotic disorders in early adulthood are most frequently diagnosed with the schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders. However, they may be the manifestation of neurologic, endocrine or immunologic disease. Individuals with NDD's such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) may also present initially in adulthood. Therefore it is not uncommon that the psychiatrist is the first physician to assess a psychotic patient with underlying medical illness or a NDD. Failure to identify the underlying cause will delay appropriate management. Overdiagnosis of primary psychiatric disorders may be misleading in planning the treatment, as evidence-based treatment algorithms relevant to psychosis are intended for primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, and symptomatic treatment may result in unnecessary exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Exclusion of other medical conditions and NDD's is essential before establishing a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

      "abstract": "<b>Abstract:</b> Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndromic label for people with informant-corroborated memory problems and evidence of memory impairment on formal testing in the absence of more pervasive deficits in cognition and functional abilities. It is often described as a “risk factor” for dementia though this is misleading; patients with the first signs of Alzheimer9s disease (AD) will meet the criteria for MCI and as their illness progresses they will move to more traditional criteria for dementia (eg, DSM). Importantly though, they have not changed or “converted” from one disease to another. The problem with MCI clinically, and hence the reason why all such patients are not simply diagnosed with very mild AD is that as one moves closer to normal performance (ie, not clearly demented), the risk of patients who do not have AD (eg, so-called “worried well”; depression; alternate degenerative or non-degenerative pathology) being captured by the MCI syndrome increases. Furthermore, although the concept of MCI seems straightforward, “absence of dementia” or “intact cognition in domains other than memory” or even “objective evidence of memory impairment” varies according to the methods used to define each criterion. Nevertheless, with longitudinal follow-up to confirm that initial MCI status was due to incipient AD, this syndrome offers a important window to examine the earliest symptomatic stages of the disease. Emerging evidence from such studies have highlighted that incipient (MCI-stage) AD is underpinned by degeneration of an interconnected neural circuit including mesial temporal lobe, diencephalon and posterior cingulate regions—all of which, interestingly, have been implicated in memory processing from focal lesion studies in humans.",

Although the medical literature also implicates head trauma as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, these findings are predominantly based on clinical diagnostic criteria that lack specificity. The dementia that follows head injuries or repetitive mild trauma may be caused by chronic traumatic encephalopathy, alone or in conjunction with other neurodegenerations (for example, Alzheimer's disease).

      "abstract": "Le patologie neurodegenerative associate ai disturbi neuro- cognitivi (DNC) rappresentano una emergenza assistenziale dalle dimensioni epidemiologiche sempre più rilevanti. Tale emergenza è destinata ad aumen- tare in relazione a un progressivo aumento della prospettiva di vita, essendo i DNC correlati con l'età. Se è vero che i DNC si manifestano con una franca alterazione delle funzioni cognitive con impatto funzionale nella vita della persona colpita, è altrettanto vero che il processo patologico inizia, molte volte, prima della comparsa della sindrome clinica. In questo intervallo di tempo, anche a distanza di anni dall'esordio del DNC, possono presentarsi quadri clinici più o meno sfumati di disturbo cognitivo accomunati dall'e- tichetta di \"disturbo cognitivo lieve\" o Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) e di Disturbo Cognitivo Soggettivo o Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD). Una generale sensibilità a queste forme prodromiche è necessaria per: 1) l'impostazione di un quadro di intervento farmacologico, neuropsicologico ed assistenziale tempestivo ed efficace; 2) l'inserimento della persona in trial clinici per la sperimentazione di farmaci per la stabilizzazione della patolo- gia degenerativa. Ad oggi la distinzione tra invecchiamento normale, forme lievi o soggettive e la loro evoluzione in quadri di DNC maggiori avviene attraverso una attenta anamnesi cognitivo-comportamentale ed una accura- ta valutazione clinica compreso un uso attento e competente degli strumenti cognitivi di screening. Tuttavia, negli ultimi anni, un apporto importante è anche stato offerto dalle tecnologie e nello specifico dall'Intelligenza Artificiale (IA), dal Machi- ne Learning (ML) e dal Deep Learning (DL). Questi strumenti si sono dimo- strati accurati e affidabili: 1) nella rilevazione precoce di un DNC; 2) nella prognosi di una potenziale evoluzione di un DNC lieve in maggiore; 3) nella diagnosi differenziale dei DNC. Il presente lavoro ha l'obiettivo di mostrare in che modo l'applicazione dell'IA, del ML e del DL possa contribuire a una più efficace e tempestiva diagnosi dei disturbi neurodegenerativi.",

      "abstract": "Imaging is important in the evaluation of patients with degenerative disease and infectious processes. There are numerous conditions that can manifest as low back pain (LBP) or neck pain in a patient, and in many cases, the cause may be multifactorial. Clinical history and physical examination are key components in the evaluation of such patients; however, physical examination has variable sensitivity and specificity. Although studies have demonstrated that uncomplicated acute LBP and/or radiculopathy are self-limited conditions that do not warrant any imaging, neuroimaging can provide clear anatomic delineation of potential causes of the patient's clinical presentation. Various professional organizations have recommendations for imaging of LBP, which generally agree that an imaging study is not indicated for patients with uncomplicated LBP or radiculopathy without a red flag (eg, neurological deficit such as major weakness or numbness in lower extremities, bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, fever, history of cancer, intravenous drug use, immunosuppression, trauma, or worsening symptoms). Different imaging modalities have a complementary role in the diagnosis of pathologies affecting the spine. In this review, we discuss the standard nomenclature for lumbar disk pathology and the utility of various clinical imaging techniques in the evaluation of LBP/neck pain for potential neurosurgical management. The imaging appearance of spinal infections and potential mimics also is reviewed. Finally, we discuss advanced neuroradiological techniques that offer greater microstructural and functional information.

RPK utiče na svakodnevne veštine ali i na školska postignuća. Visoka prevalencija (5-8 %) govori u prilog tome da u svakom razredu ili vrtićkoj grupi možemo očekivati jedno dete/učenika za ovim problemom.

Etilogija RPK je multifaktorska. Najviše problema učenici sa RPK pokazuju na nastavi fizičkog vaspitanja, srpskog jezika i matematike.

      "abstract": "The principal applications of electroencephalography to child neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry are as follows: Abnormalities in the EEG of parents or siblings of patients with nervous or mental disease assists in evaluating possible hereditary factors. Nervous and mental disorders caused by abnormalities of intrauterine development, injuries or anoxia at birth, encephalopathies of toxic, metabolic or infectious origin, and severe head injuries, may be reflected in abnormal brain waves in many but not all cases. In some, the location and type of cerebral pathology may allow marked changes in behavior, such as spastic paraplegia, with no significant alteration in the EEG. The EEG gives little reliable information with regard to intelligence and the finer structure of personality. Cerebral damage due to tumor, abscess, trauma or local vascular lesion may be localized by the EEG but pathologic diagnosis must be made from a careful history and other methods of clinical examination in most cases.proved methods, deepseated lesions involving subcortical structures, as well as superficial lesions, may frequently be accurately localized by the EEG. Subdural hematomata are not accurately diagnosed by the EEG in most cases. The EEG is most useful in the epilepsies and convulsive disorders. Differential diagnosis between idiopathic epilepsy and symptomatic convulsive disorders can usually be made by the EEG except for certain postencephalitic conditions which may simulate the electroencephalographic patterns of the idiopathic or \"genetic\" epilepsies. The form of clinical seizure depends upon the brain area of onset of the epileptic discharge, and its path of spread. The form of electrical disturbance has no specific significance except as pointing to a certain localization of onset. A wide variety of seizures are caused by focal epileptic discharge arising primarily in various areas of the cortex. These may be localized by the EEG when on the convexity of the hemispheres, but may be missed when buried in fissures or on the ventral or mesial surfaces of the brain. They are frequently discovered only when electrodes are placed directly on the brain surface exposed at operation. Bifrontal rhythmic disturbances may be caused by foci on the mesial or orbital surface of one frontal lobe. Bitemporal rhythmic disturbances may be caused by a focal epileptogenic lesion deep in one temporal region. The wave and spike pattern of petit mal epilepsy can be reproduced by local stimulation in certain parts of the thalamus. The EEG may be of assistance in assessing the initial severity and progress of recovery from cerebral trauma due to head injury. Profound alterations in the EEG occur during the acute stage of any form of encephalitis. Residual changes are of value in prognosis, especially with regard to epileptiform disorders. In child psychiatry, the EEG may point to an unsuspected organic basis for particularly intractable behavior. However, it is of little value for specific diagnostic purposes except as related to epileptic equivalent states and disorders due to focal lesions or diffuse encephalopathy.",

      "abstract": "Muscle weakness is a common complaint among patients presenting to family physicians. Diagnosis begins with a patient history distinguishing weakness from fatigue or asthenia, separate conditions with different etiologies that can coexist with, or be confused for, weakness. The pattern and severity of weakness, associated symptoms, medication use, and family history help the physician determine whether the cause of a patient's weakness is infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced. In the physical examination, the physician should objectively document the patient's loss of strength, conduct a neurologic survey, and search for patterns of weakness and extramuscular involvement. If a specific cause of weakness is suspected, the appropriate laboratory or radiologic studies should be performed. Otherwise, electromyography is indicated to confirm the presence of a myopathy or to evaluate for a neuropathy or a disease of the neuromuscular junction. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the examiner should pursue a tiered progression of laboratory studies. Physicians should begin with blood chemistries and a thyroid-stimulating hormone assay to evaluate for electrolyte and endocrine causes, then progress to creatine kinase level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and antinuclear antibody assays to evaluate for rheumatologic, inflammatory, genetic, and metabolic causes. Finally, many myopathies require a biopsy for diagnosis. Pathologic evaluation of the muscle tissue specimen focuses on histologic, histochemical, electron microscopic, biochemical, and genetic analyses; advances in technique have made a definitive diagnosis possible for many myopathies.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe, chronic, and recurring mental disorder, which is frequently accompanied by co-occurring mental and somatic illnesses. Compelling evidence indicates that patients with MDD exhibit cognitive impairment encompassing several domains, including but not limited to, executive function, verbal memory, and attention. In addition, cognitive impairment may be evident even during remission and appears to play a major role in the persistence of psychosocial dysfunction (including impairment in workforce). Therefore, several compounds have been tested as putative cognitive enhancers for MDD. Although antidepressant treatment may be associated with modest improvements in some cognitive domains (namely psychomotor speed and delayed recall), evidence thus far remains unclear owing to methodological limitations across clinical trials. These methodological limitations include: (i) lack of adequate screening for cognitive dysfunction at baseline; (ii) the inclusion of samples that were not in remission at baseline; pseudospecificity (i.e. observed effects on cognition could be due to secondary improvement in mood); (iii) cognitive function was not the primary outcome in some trials; and (iv) lack of standardization of cognitive measures employed across studies. Replicated evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that vortioxetine and duloxetine may have procognitive effects. Furthermore, data from RCTs suggest that lisdexamfetamine, modafinil, metformin, and erythropoietin may also have beneficial cognitive effects. In conclusion, the achievement of cognitive remission remains an unmet goal in the treatment of MDD. Future research directions, including methodological improvements in the conduct of RCTs targeting MDD-related cognitive dysfunction, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The knowledge of the brain processes underlying mental disorders has significantly increased during the last decades, but in spite of this very important research effort a biological marker is not available for such disorders. For example, neurophysiological techniques (EEG and MEG),have been broadly utilized in the investigation of the most important psychiatric syndromes such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder or obsessive/compulsive disorder. The outcomes of some of those neurophysiological studies allowed the building of statistical models with very high sensitivity and specificity, although those models did not reach day-to-day clinical practice. A potential explanation for this situation is an inadequate analysis procedure which might be missing some important quantums of information contained in brain signals. In this vein, new methods of non-linear analysis have been proposed for the investigation of neurophysiological data. Particularly, the analysis of brain signals' complexity has been broadly utilized in the investigation of psychiatric disorders. Parameters of EEG-MEG complexity usually estimate the predictability of brain oscillations and/or the number of independent oscillators underlying the observed signals. More importantly, complexity parameters seem to be sensitive to the temporal components of brain activity, and therefore might reflect the dynamical nature of psychiatric disorders. This paper reviews some of the most relevant studies within this field, especially those focusing on the diagnosis, follow-up and prediction of response to treatment.",

      "title": "Defining Mental Health in Later Life",
      "abstract": "Although mental health has traditionally received little attention other than as the absence of mental illness, lifespan psychology has recently generated research that enlightens us about the factors that constitute psychological well-being. Similarly, recent evidence about the preventive benefits of wellness and successful aging have renewed attention on the importance of defining mental health-even though the mental health service-delivery network in the western world is based on a medical model that only addresses illness and disorder. TRADITIONAL MODELS FOR DEFINING MENTAL HEALTH Traditional models for defining mental health include approaches and core constructs that also can be applied to studies of well-being. Statistical definitions of mental health use comparisons between individuals to identify people whose functioning falls at the outer ends of the theoretical bell curve of normative data. For instance, on a characteristic such as mood, people experiencing levels at the highest or lowest extremes would be considered abnormal (e.g., manic or depressed), while those falling in the middle would be considered normal according to a definition that equates normative with normal. Obvious problems arise with this definition, as certain characteristics (e.g., cognitive functioning) are abnormal only in one direction, and other characteristics do not lend themselves to this kind of statistical approach at all (e.g., vitality). A symptom-based definition of mental health is the underpinning of the current diagnostic system used by mental health practitioners and policy makers. The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) defines mental disorders and syndromes in terms of clusters of symptoms that often coexist in particular constellations or patterns and that impair a person's day-to-day functioning or cause personal distress. Within this approach, mental health is defined primarily by the absence of symptoms known to impair functioning. Again, obvious problems arise within this approach, as certain people may be symptom-free but not viewed by others as mentally healthy (e.g., a sociopath, defined as such because of behavior). Moral or spiritual approaches to psychosocial functioning continue to influence definitions of mental health and illness. Such definitions are used in more traditional cultures and subcultures to focus on prosocial characteristics that are considered evidence of mental health. The notion that the spiritual world influences behavior both positively and negatively remains evident in dominant western culture. In addition, many ethnic groups rely on such frameworks for their primary understanding of how to interpret and influence behavior. Cultural differences in relying on spiritual beliefs to define mental well-being or mental problems are a clear challenge to this approach. Subjective distress is commonly used to partially determine the presence or absence of mental health and disorders. The DSM-IV includes subjective distress as one outcome alternative that could lead to the determination that symptom patterns are sufficiently intense to warrant diagnosis. Heavy reliance on subjective criteria as a major indicator of well-being may be of concern, however, because of humans' capacity to adapt to a variety of adverse conditions and consider them normal (Baltes and Baltes, 1990). Furthermore, many people with significant disorders do not recognize themselves to be distressed (e.g., pedophiles and others with personality disorders). Each of these approaches offers a meaningful contribution to definitions of mental health and disorder, and, together, the approaches have furthered efforts of the past two decades to develop a useful nomenclature for mental disorder. However, these approaches are less useful for efforts to define mental health. NEW DIRECTIONs FROM LIFESPAN PSYCHOLOGY Recent discussions about theory and data in the lifespan psychology literature provide yet another set of frameworks for formulating a definition for mental health in later life. …",

      "title": "Anorexia nervosa or starvation?",
      "abstract": "Is this related to anorexia nervosa or to starvation? Every individual conducting research in anorexia nervosa (AN) has undoubtedly asked themselves this question. AN is an incredibly difficult illness to research as it is fundamentally a mental illness but results in very serious physical consequences. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), AN is characterised by a disturbance of body image and a restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). A significant change in physical state (i.e. significant weight loss) is thus a core diagnostic criterion. Thus, diagnosis of AN is dependent on an individual starving themselves to achieve a significant reduction in their body weight. Starvation results in undeniable physiological changes throughout the body, including the brain. As a consequence, essentially all research undertaken in AN, with the exception of some fields such as genetics, is influenced to some degree by the malnourished state of patients. An additional complexity is that some people with AN also engage in binging and purging as well as other strategies to lose weight, including excessive exercise. Disentangling whether findings are due to the illness itself, or are epiphenomena consequent upon starvation is an exceptionally difficult task. In an attempt to control for the effects of starvation on research findings, individuals who are weight-restored or recovered from AN are often assessed rather than acutely unwell and underweight patients. To date, this is perhaps the most widely used method to overcome this confound. However, the long-term effects of starvation on the brain are relatively unknown (Phillipou, Rossell, & Castle, 2014), leaving us essentially in the same position as assessing underweight patients. To identify whether research findings are a result of the illness or a consequence of starvation, a control group of healthy individuals who have been deprived adequate nutrition for a sustained period of time would be required. In modern times, this would indisputably be considered unethical. However, prior to the introduction of strict ethical standards, a number of human starvation studies were undertaken. The most famous of these is the Minnesota Starvation Experiment conducted by Keys et al. (1950) in which 36 young males underwent partial starvation for 6 months. A number of physiological and psychological variables were monitored and assessed throughout this period, many of which demonstrated striking similarities to AN, including severe emotional distress and depressive symptoms, self-harm, social withdrawal, and repetitive, obsessive/perfectionistic and ritualistic behaviours relating to food and eating. These behaviours are also often linked to serotonin depletion (Lucki, 1998), which may be expected considering an estimated 95% of serotonin is produced in the gastrointestinal tract (Kim & Camilleri, 2000), and the restriction of food consumption alters the integrity of this organ system. A small number of more recent studies have also shed light onto the cognitive effects of short-term fasting in healthy individuals, including deficits in cognitive flexibility (Piech, Hampshire, Owen, & Parkinson, 2009) and attentional biases to food stimuli (Placanica, Faunce, & Soames Job, 2002); behaviours often characteristic of AN. Changes in cognition, such as deficits in short-term memory, have also been reported in groups who experience rapid weight loss such as athletes in preparation for competition (Choma, Sforzo, & Keller, 1998). Relatedly, the effects of long-term fasting and starvation are likely to significantly alter cognitive functioning in AN. Therefore, the persistence of cognitive alterations and associated behaviours may play a role in habit learning that support the maintenance of the illness. Despite the similarities between starvation effects and AN symptomatology, starvation-related findings are often overlooked in the literature and these characteristics are frequently attributed as trait features of AN as they often continue to recovery. It is, however, unclear whether the consequences of starvation might also be a consequence of AN. To allow the field of AN to move forward, we need to focus our attention on disentangling the effects of the illness from that of starvation. Early human starvation studies provide a basis for this. Investigating gut-brain interactions in AN will also provide further insight into the illness, and is an emerging area of interest in the field. A greater number of rigorous and systematic retrospective and family-based studies are also required to shed light onto features of AN prior to illness onset, and consequently, identify whether they are present irrespective of starvation. Thorough investigations in atypical AN are also essential. Individuals with atypical AN meet all criteria for AN, but despite significant weight loss, are not underweight. Rigorous psychological, biological, and neurobiological investigations comparing typical with atypical AN patients are critical for unravelling the effects of starvation in this illness. Furthermore, greater research into at-risk groups and individuals in the early phases of illness (with presumably only short-term starvation) is essential to enhance our understanding of the disorder. The identification of reliable and valid biomarkers for AN is critical for this purpose, but are not yet available for AN (Phillipou, Rossell, Castle, Gurvich, & Abel, 2014). Biomarker identification is an essential area of research that needs to be pursued in AN. Distinguishing AN from the effects of starvation is essential to our understanding of the illness and will ultimately lead to the development of more effective treatments. Until we are able to differentiate between AN and starvation, we cannot be confident in almost all research findings in this illness.

      "abstract": "Purpose of review In the central nervous system there are many regulatory processes controlling the lower urinary tract. This review considers the possibility that urinary dysfunction may precede diagnosis of neurological disease. Recent findings Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) occur early in multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and normal pressure hydrocephalus, and may present before neurological diagnosis. Some people present with LUTS and subsequently are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or a spinal condition. In male LUTS, the symptoms could reflect early stages of a neurological disease, which has not yet been diagnosed (‘occult neurology’). Key symptoms include erectile dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation, enuresis, loss of filling sensation or unexplained stress urinary incontinence. Directed questioning should enquire about visual symptoms, back pain, anosmia, bowel dysfunction and incontinence, or memory loss. Examination features can include resting tremor, ‘croaky’ speech, abnormal gait, orthostatic hypotension, ataxia, or altered perineal sensation. Imaging, such as MRI scan, should only be requested after expert neurological examination, to ensure the correct parts of the central nervous system are scanned with appropriate radiological protocols. Summary Urologists should consider an undiagnosed neurological condition can be present in a few cases. Any finding should be further evaluated by colleagues with relevant expertise.",

      "title": "Psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a speciality of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and study of mental diseases or disorders. Its practitioners are psychiatrists (in the United States, physicians who complete four years of approved training following their 148graduation from medical school). A number of professionals from other disciplines treat patients with psychiatric disorders. The most important of these are clinical psychologists, psychiatric social workers and psychiatric nurses. They commonly refer to those who seek help as 'clients' rather than 'patients'. These professionals may work in various collaborative relationships with psychiatrists or as independent practitioners. They employ the same verbal therapies as psychiatrists. Psychiatry differs from these specialities in being a medical discipline whose practitioners are physicians. As such, psychiatrists are specifically trained to (1) make precise syndromal or aetiological diagnoses, whenever possible, and distinguish one syndrome from another; (2) diagnose (or know when to refer to other physicians) those organic conditions which mimic psychiatric disorders such as brain tumour, cancer of the pancreas, and hyperthyroidism (these conditions can present as anxiety or depressive disorders); (3) treat particular psychiatric disorders with psychotropic medications or other somatic treatments; (4) manage untoward psychological reactions to medical illness; and (5) integrate the biological with the psychological and social dimensions of mental disorders. In addition, the psychiatrist's training in medicine may encourage a research career in the biology of mental disorders. American psychiatrists as a whole have a high level of expertise in psychological treatments, particularly the psychodynamic approach. This is due to the impact of psychoanalytic theory on academic psychiatry especially since 1945, when many distinguished psychoanalysts assumed the chairs of academic departments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Autonomic nervous system involvement is an important feature of many acute and chronic peripheral neuropathies (Table 5-1). Neuropathies may affect both somatic and autonomic nerves, or less often, autonomic nervous system failure may be the major or sole manifestation of the condition. In either case, autonomic reflex testing has emerged as an important diagnostic tool. Examples where autonomic reflex tests are valuable include acute panautonomia (Chapter 9), pure autonomic failure, and paraneoplastic intestinal pseudoobstruction. In patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung, autonomic failure may precede other manifestations of the disease. In other patients, such as those with small-fiber sensory neuropathies, loss of a particular autonomic nervous system function, like sudomotor function of the distal extremity; can provide objective evidence of nerve fiber damage that may be difficult to substantiate by other means (see Case Report 1: Idiopathic Painful Sensory Neuropathy).",

Concurrently, comorbidity between different psychiatric disorders is immense, as well as comorbidity with somatic disorders. Cognitive function is often decreased in people with depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis, but whether these disorders are risk factors for dementia is unclear. Psychiatric disorders in the elderly are often related to cerebral neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease, although psychosocial risk factors are also important.

      "abstract": "In the cases of majority of neurological diseases the symptoms of depression have significant influence on the worsening of the quality of patient’s life, regardless of the severity of the neurological disorders. In the most of neurodegenerative diseases the symptoms of depression often precede the appearance of neurological symptoms. Within recent years, numerous studies have been published demonstrating that disorders of depressive spectrum can be considered as a predictor of some types of dementia. Existing data regarding the methods of therapeutic intervention for depression in the clinical practice are rather scarce, scattered and often based on the «personal experience» of neurologists and psychiatrists. In some patients the diagnostics of depression in the context of neurological disorders can be difficult due to the difficulties in the establishing the contact with the patient as well as cognitive deviations related to neurological disorders. In order to facilitate this task, the effective screening diagnostic methods have been developed for the diagnosis of depression in the context of neurological diseases. The results of clinical studies performed within recent years confirm the important role of the neurologist for the evaluation and the treatment of the symptoms of depression, both at the initial stage and at the stage of remission. The purpose of the current review is to systematize the accumulated data on the disorders of depressive spectrum in the context of neurological practice, as well as to demonstrate the role of neurologist in the process of diagnosis and treatment of the symptoms of depression in neurological diseases.",

Furthermore, involvement of cranial nerves was described as rare complications of SS. Methods. We reported 2 cases: the first one was a 40-year-old woman who developed neuritis of the left optic nerve as presenting symptom few years before the diagnosis of SS; the second was a 54-year-old woman who presented a paralysis of the right phrenic nerve 7 years after the SS onset. An exhaustive review of the literature on patients with cranial or phrenic nerve involvements was also carried out. Results. To the best of our knowledge, our second case represents the first observation of SS-associated phrenic nerve mononeuritis, while optic neuritis represents the most frequent cranial nerve involvement detectable in this connective tissue disease. Trigeminal neuropathy is also frequently reported, whereas neuritis involving the other cranial nerves is quite rare. Conclusions. Cranial nerve injury is a harmful complication of SS, even if less commonly recorded compared to peripheral neuropathy. Neurological manifestations may precede the clinical onset of SS; therefore, in patients with apparently isolated cranial nerve involvement, a correct diagnosis of the underlying SS is often delayed or overlooked entirely; in these instances, standard clinicoserological assessment is recommendable.",

      "abstract": "Compulsive overeating disorder (COD, overeating associated with other psychological causes) is one of the most common eating disorders and is associated with significant concomitant somatic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart failure, coronary heart disease, etc. According to numerous studies, COD can occur as a comorbid nosology in mental disorders: affective and anxiety disorders, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, etc. [1]. Thus, the coexistence of compulsive overeating and other mental disorders is a common fact in medical practice, but the results of scientific research remain rather uninformative and contradictory [1]. The aim of the work: to analyze some data from literary sources on the issue of comorbidity of compulsive overeating and other mental disorders with the analysis of a clinical case from practice.",

      "abstract": "Every illness represents in some way a threat and increases the sense of vulnerability. The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs. Four of the most common epilepsies are: (1) grand mal — manifested by major convulsions, usually a sequence of tonic spasm of all body musculature followed by synchronous clonic jerking and prolonged post-seizure depression of all central functions; (2) petit mal — characterized by brief attacks of loss of consciousness usually accompanied by some clonic motor activity, sometimes with no motor activity, and sometimes with complete relaxation of all musculature; (3) psychomotor epilepsy — characterized by attacks of confused behavior with a wide variety of clinical manifestations; (4) focal cortical epilepsy in which there may be motor abnormalities including convulsions of single limbs or muscle groups or specific and localized sensory disturbances depending on the particular area of cortex producing the abnormal electrical activity.",

      "abstract": "This review discusses articles on cognitive impairments developing after one or more convulsive seizures. Cognitive disorders seem to be frequent complications of epilepsy. According to recent clinical studies, the intensity of cognitive declines depends on a frequency and severity of seizures. However, presence of an epileptic focus does not always indicate an increase in cognitive impairments. An effect of a single convulsive seizure on cognitive functions at this stage is uncertain. According to some data, cognitive impairments after a single generalized seizures develop only in specific clinical syndromes, on the other hand, they are influenced by the emotional state of the subject. This problem remains relevant today. Further work is needed in this direction.В обзоре рассматриваются результаты исследований, посвященных когнитивным нарушениям (КН) после одного или нескольких судорожных приступов. Согласно полученным данным выраженность когнитивных изменений зависит от частоты и силы приступов. Но влияние однократного судорожного приступа на КФ точно не установлено: по данным одних исследователей, КН после однократного генерализованного судорожного приступа развиваются только при отдельных клинических синдромах, по другим - большое влияние оказывает эмоциональное состояние обследуемого. Подчеркивается, что наличие эпилептического очага не всегда говорит о нарастающем снижении когнитивных функций. Актуальность проблемы, по мнению авторов, определяет необходимость продолжения ее активных исследований.",

      "title": "Personality Disorders",
      "abstract": "Compared with many other psychiatric disorders, personality disorders are relatively difficult and time intensive to diagnose and treat. In elderly persons, personality problems are confounded by a variety of additional issues, both negative and positive. The natural history of personality in later life is affected by the combination of increasing medical-neuropsychiatric comorbidity with ongoing normal psychosocial development. As a person ages, the likelihood of multiple chronic diseases increases. The existence of comorbidity results in more functional impairment and requires adaptation (Marengoni et al. 2011). It can become more difficult to ascertain the primary cause of increased impairment and to determine where best to focus therapeutic interventions. The risk of neurocognitive disorders also increases dramatically in later life. A common feature of dementias is a change in personality or an exacerbation of preexisting characteristics. Without longitudinal history it can be difficult to know whether such presentations are manifestations of a personality disorder, a neurocognitive disorder, or both. It is not uncommon for geriatric psychiatrists to comment that problems related to personality disorders are less frequently a focus in their patients compared with the patients of their general psychiatry colleagues. Prevalence studies tend to support this observation. If these prevalence studies are valid, there are several explanations as to why at least some personality disorders might fade with age. One that deserves attention is that of maturation, described in adult development theory and research. Although general research in personality disorders has increased, there is a relative dearth of such studies with respect to elderly persons (Agronin and Maletta 2000). This lack is particularly clear in the area of treatment. Substantial evidence shows the negative effect of personality disorders on the outcome of depressive disorders in elderly persons. In contrast to research on personality disorders, there has been a dramatic increase in research on the relationship of personality traits in the elderly to cognitive dysfunction, morbidity, and mortality (Oldham and Skodol 2013). Although certain personality traits are significantly related to poor outcomes, evidence on the benefits of treatment for personality traits or disorders in elderly persons remains limited. There is even less evidence on treatment and outcomes in nursing homes and general hospitals, the settings in which the geriatric psychiatrist is most likely to be called on to diagnose and treat personality disorders and traits.",

Clinically, it oftentimes appears unclear whether the affective or the cognitive problems are primary or secondary. Modern molecular and imaging markers contribute to a more efficient distinction between depression and incipient dementia due to neurodegenerative, vascular, and other diseases.

If in doubt, the condition should always be considered as potentially reversible and treated emphatically (but with age-appropriate caution).",

      "abstract": "Presenile dementia does not appear to be a well-defined clinico-anatomical entity, and single case studies are helpful in elucidating the problem of pathogenesis and classification. Two cases of presenile dementia are described. One is that of a man who, at the age of 52, developed the typical organic syndrome, with certain signs of focal cortical impairment such as aphasia, paraphasia and disturbances of reading, writing and picture recognition. After severe general deterioration he died at the age of 60, and post-mortem examination revealed the typical histological features of Alzheimer's disease. The second case is that of a woman who at about the age of 42 began to show unspecific symptoms such as diffuse anxiety, definite phobias and general restlessness, suggestive of a psychoneurosis or the beginning of a functional psychosis. After several years she gradually developed severe disorders of conduct, intellectual and speech impairment. She died in a state of extreme organic dementia and physical deterioration at the age of 48. Post-mortem examination showed severe generalized cortical atrophy (brain weight 864 gms.) with the signs of senility except that the characteristic histological features of Alzheimer's disease were entirely absent. It has been suggested (Lewy 1925, Spatz 1925) that the process of ageing manifests itself in the central nervous system along two different lines. Atrophy, brown pigment, proliferation of interstitial tissue represent the \"primary\" phenomena of ageing, and are not confined to the central nervous system or to man. However, the combination of neurofibrillary changes and argentophile plaques is a \"secondary\" phenomenon of ageing which occurs only in man and in the phylogenetically most recent structures of the nervous system. The two cases here presented demonstrate that the \"primary\" and \"secondary\" phenomena of ageing occur independently. The significance of this fact and its clinical and pathological implications are discussed.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ?

The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

For example, carpal tunnel syndrome is not uncommon in patients who are pregnant or have diabetes, hypothyroidism, or acromegaly. Joint problems and arthritis are other common findings in diabetes, pregnancy, and hyperparathyroidism. Muscle weakness or stiffness is seen in both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, and muscle wasting is a characteristic of adrenocorticoid insufficiency. Bone disorders are common with glucocorticoid excess, acromegaly, and hyperparathyroidism. Some presentations are a classic picture of a specific endocrine condition and are readily recognized if the index of suspicion is appropriately high.",

The symptoms of senile encephalomyelosis are acute or sub- acute mental disturbances of the organic reaction type, usually associated with posterolateral sclerosis (rarely transverse myelitis or spastic spinal paralysis), sometimes associated with polyneuritis and very often associated with hypochromic or hyperchromic anemia, with or without gastric anacidity (hypoacidity). 3. Senile encephalomyelosis appears to be much more frequent in women than in men. 4. The relationship of senile encephalomyelosis to senile anorexia, primary cachexia, senile hypochromic achylic anemia and pernicious anemia can be established. 5. Hypervitaminization, particularly treatment with vitamin B1, liver extract and nicotinic acid, seems to give very good results. 6. Every case of so-called senile delirium or of the apparent confusional and hallucinatory type of senile dementia should be examined from this point of view and tentative hypervitaminization should be instituted. 7. The pathogenesis of senile encephalomyelosis is unknown. A possible hypothesis, however, is that hormonal and more especially, pituitary disturbances might be responsible.",

Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status. Failure to distinguish act from status accounts for the wide disparities in definitions of malingering.",

Se origina y manifiesta antes de los 18 años y puede asociarse a otros trastornos de neurodesarrollo o a problemas de salud física o mental. Es un trastorno plurietiológico, habitualmente de causa genética (1). Es frecuente que los pacientes con DI asocien otros problemas neurológicos que contribuyen de forma desfavorable a su evolución. Se describe su coexistencia con trastornos motores, epilepsia y/o alteraciones neurosensoriales. Además, existe una alta comorbilidad de patología psiquiátrica en la que por lo general los síntomas suelen pasar desapercibidos por atribuirse a la misma condición clínica lo que repercute en su correcto tratamiento con un mayor ingreso hospitalario, polifarmacia y conductas de riesgo que la población sin discapacidad intelectual. Entre los trastornos psiquiátricos más asociados a DI en la primera infancia encontramos los trastornos del espectro autista, los trastornos de conducta y ansiedad (2,3).",

In this sense, disability ceases to be the result of a disease or sequel of it. Impairment (deficiencies) is any abnormality or loss of a body structure or physiological function including mental function. Neurological and neuro-psychiatric disorders are frequent and specific conditions that cause a variety of structural and physiological impairments associated with potential disabilities. Neurological disorders are those which cause the greatest amount of life years adjusted for disability. The ones whith greater magnitude and frequency are classical neurological stroke-type disease, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis, neuro psychiatric disorders such as unipolar depression and mental disabilities. The aim of this paper is to document and highlight the importance and magnitude of impairments neurological and neuro psychiatric, on the issue of human disability. Disability is a cross-cutting issue, and the health sector and the neurosciences are not immune to it.",

      "title": "‘Causal relation between spasticity, strength, gross motor function, and functional outcome in children with cerebral palsy: a path analysis’",
      "abstract": "SIR–In their recent article1 Kim and Park fail to deal with the entirety of Dr Lance’s classical definition of spasticity.2 His carefully drafted statement documented the consensus of the 1979 symposium of 44 actively engaged neurological investigators (including me): ‘Spasticity is a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (‘muscle tone’) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome. This did not preclude discussion of other features of the upper motor neuron syndrome resulting from release of flexor reflexes, such as flexor spasms, or the negative symptoms such as the pattern of weakness and loss of dexterity caused by withdrawal of the influence of descending motor pathways.’2 Thus spasticity is not a subjective symptom like headache or diplopia. It is rather an objective observation of the professional examination, like a cardiac murmur or a dilated pupil. There is abundant evidence that the truly disabling negative symptoms, often more impaired dexterity than strength, are directly correlated with the degree of disconnection of the target motor neuron population from the complexly integrated control of forebrain and hindbrain nerve structures. This loss of fine control and force is neither augmented by antagonist muscle stretch reflexes3 or improved by systemic medication, fusimotor blockade,4 or dorsal rhizotomy.5 Nor is the degree of clumsiness directly correlated with the prevalence of spasticity.6 The Ashworth Scale has never been more than an amateur parascientific game, with personal impressions of stiffness and absent replicable physical parameters. Recently, Fleuren et al. 7 have gone to the trouble of proving that the Ashworth Scale is worthless. Occam’s razor requires cessation of the senseless and useless demonization of the spasticity epiphenomenon. Absent evidence-based potions, patients should be assisted to practice toward maximal autonomous function.",

      "abstract": "Chronische Erschöpfung lässt sich aufgrund vorliegender Befunde zu konstitutionellen Voraussetzungen, auslösenden und aufrechterhalten Bedingungen als eine funktionelle Störung beschreiben. Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

Electrophysiological examinations showed no particularities. Neither did the muscular morphological picture in most of the cases presenting neurogenic lesions with a moderate intensity.

Las sinucleinopatias son la segunda causa de demencia degenerativa despues de la enfermedad de Alzheimer. Se caracterizan neuropatologicamente por inclusiones de alfa-sinucleina en el tronco cerebral, nucleos subcorticales, areas neocorticales y limbicas, y clinicamente por demencia, alteraciones atencionales, parkinsonismo y comunmente alucinaciones visuales.Dado que la DCL y la EPD presentan un solapamiento clinico, se ha argumentado que pueden representar la misma enfermedad. La DCL se diagnostica cuando la demencia ocurre antes o de manera paralela al parkinsonismo, mientras que el termino EPD es usado para describir la demencia que ocurre en el contexto de una EP bien establecida.La presente tesis doctoral consta de dos estudios los objetivos de los cuales fueron establecer las diferencias en sustancia gris cerebral entre DCL y EPD mediante la tecnica de analisis voxel-based morphometry aplicada a imagenes de resonancia magnetica potenciada en T1, asi como determinar las diferencias en perfil cognitivo en estos grupos de pacientes. Asimismo, en el primer estudio, se evaluo la relacion entre las estructuras cerebrales y las funciones cognitivas en estos pacientes, y en el segundo estudio, se evaluaron los correlatos neuroanatomicos de las alucinaciones visuales, asi como su correlacion con el funcionamiento cognitivo en este grupo de pacientes.Para ello se estudiaron un total de 12 pacientes diagnosticados de DCL, 16 pacientes con EPD y 16 controles sanos apareados por edad y sexo, mediante una secuencia de RM 3D potenciada en T1 adquirida en un escaner de 1.5 Tesla y una evaluacion neuropsicologica y conductual.Las conclusiones que se derivan de este estudio son las siguientes:Los pacientes con DLC y EPD presentan un patron diferente de atrofia regional. En comparacion con los controles, los pacientes con EPD presentan mayor reduccion en areas parieto-occipitales y los pacientes con DCL en areas frontales, temporales y parietales. Ademas, los pacientes con DCL tienen una mayor perdida de sustancia gris que los EPD en diversas areas frontales, en concreto en las circunvoluciones frontal inferior, frontal superior y premotora.En los analisis individuales, los pacientes con DCL y los pacientes con EPD presentan una perdida de sustancia gris hipocampal bilateral, pero solo la frecuencia de la reduccion hipocampal derecha fue significativamente mayor en DCL que en EPD.La presencia de alucinaciones visuales se relaciona con una reduccion de la sustancia gris en regiones frontales en ambos grupos, pero en diferentes areas. En los pacientes con DCL en la circunvolucion frontal inferior y en la EPD en la region orbitofrontal. Asimismo, la severidad y frecuencia de las alucinaciones visuales correlaciona negativamente con el volumen de la circunvolucion frontal inferior y el precuneus.En el perfil atencional, los pacientes con DCL presentan mayor distractibilidad, caracterizada por menor vigilancia, mientras que los pacientes con EPD presentan mayor impulsividad, reflejada por errores intrusivos y perseverativos.En el grupo con DCL, el deficit de memoria visual se correlaciona con un decremento del volumen del area temporal medial derecha (hipocampo y amigdala) y los deficits atencionales correlacionan con una perdida del volumen del cingulado anterior, frontal inferior y prefrontal dorsolateral bilateralmente. En este mismo grupo, la presencia y severidad de las alucinaciones visuales se relaciona con una alteracion de la fluencia verbal semantica, del control inhibitorio de la atencion y de las funciones visuoperceptivas, mientras que en los pacientes con EPD se relaciona con deficits en memoria visual.La conclusion final, es que en los dos grupos con demencia, hay un patron de perdida de sustancia gris y un perfil cognitivo diferencial.

      "title": "Concussion in Sport",
      "abstract": "Concussions affect millions of athletes of all ages each year in a variety of sports. Athletes in certain sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and combative sports like boxing are at higher risk for concussion. Direct or indirect mechanical forces acting on the skull and brain cause a concussion, which is a milder form of brain injury. Conventional neuroimaging (e.g., computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for concussion is typically negative. Concussions involve both neurometabolic and subtle structural damage to the brain that results in signs (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, confusion), symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, nausea), and functional impairment (e.g., cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor). Symptoms, impairment, and recovery time following concussion can last from a few days to weeks or months, based on a variety of risk factors, including younger age, female sex, history of concussion, and history of migraine. Following a concussion, athletes may experience one or more clinical profiles, including cognitive fatigue, vestibular, oculomotor, post-traumatic migraine (PTM), mood/anxiety, and/or cervical. The heterogeneous nature of concussion warrants a comprehensive approach to assessment, including a thorough clinical examination and interview; symptom inventories; and cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor, and exertion-based evaluations. Targeted treatment and rehabilitation strategies including behavior management, vestibular, vision, and exertion therapies, and in some cases medication can be effective in treating the various concussion clinical profiles. Some athletes experience persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and/or psychological issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) following concussion. Following appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies, determination of safe return to play is predicated on being symptom-free and back to normal levels of function at rest and following exertion. Certain populations, including youth athletes, may be at a higher risk for worse impairment and prolonged recovery following concussion. It has been suggested that some athletes experience long-term effects associated with concussion including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, additional empirical studies on the role of concussion on CTE are needed, as CTE may have multiple causes that are unrelated to sport participation and concussion.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The syndromes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild neurocognitive disorder (MiND), often prodromal to dementia (Major Neurocognitive Disorder), are characterized by acquired clinically significant changes in one or more cognitive domains despite preserved independence. Mild impairment has significant medicolegal consequences for an affected person and their care system. We review the more common etiologies of MiND and provide a systematic review of its medicolegal implications. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed English literature on medicolegal aspects of MCI or MiND using comprehensive search terms and expanding our review to include sources cited by these reports. Results: Impairment of memory, executive function, social cognition, judgment, insight or abstraction can alter an individual’s abilities in a variety of areas that include decision making, informed consent, designation of a surrogate decision-maker such as a health care proxy, understanding and management of financial affairs, execution of a will, or safe driving. Conclusion: Even mild cognitive impairment can have significant behavioral consequences. Clinicians can assist care partners and persons with MCI or MiND by alerting them to the medicolegal concerns that often accompany cognitive decline. Early recognition and discussion can help a care system manage medicolegal risk more effectively and promote thoughtful advance planning.",

Incident dementia is frequently associated with depressed mood and agitation; depression in the elderly goes together with executive and memory dysfunctions; associated psychotic symptoms and activity-of-daily-life dysfunctions are shared by both conditions as well as major risk factors as vascular and metabolic factors. Frequently both syndromes are “masking” each other; depression may furthermore present as the first clinical sign of Alzheimers disease. Yet, both clinical syndromes/disorders emerging from quite different are pathogenic neurobiological mechanisms with differentiating neuropsychological, – imaging and – chemical features.

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a disease that occurs frequently. However, people do not know much about this disease and many doctors find it difficult to diagnose such patients. Symptoms of fibromyalgia may not only include pain, but also sleep disorder, fatigue, melancholia, and other mood disorders. Pain is one of the major symptoms of many diseases and may greatly impede the quality and functionof an individual's life. Yet many clinicians have trouble treating chronic pain in part because they focus on the pain itself, which is merely one of the causes, and not on the evaluation and treatment of problems incidental to pain. It is noted that pain may be accompanied by not only physical suffering, but also emotional problems, such as melancholia and other secondary problems. The causes for fibromyalgia syndrome have not yet been clearly revealed but it is known that mental factors contribute to the occurrence and progress of the symptoms, and that the evaluation of or therapeutic interventions for the mental causes may be due to physical effects. Therefore, based on ad-equate psychiatric knowledge, clinicians should under-stand and treat the patients accordingly. It may be that more effective medical services are needed through in-tensive treatments in multidisciplinary teams for the patients. This article is aimed at investigating the psychological issues that fibromyalgia patients encounter. It also considers the psychiatric drugs and psychosocial treatment that are applied to the disease.",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

Atypical presentations include frontal dementia sometimes with additional behavioural component mimicking frontotemporal dementia, logopenic primary progressive aphasia and posterior cortical atrophy, while mixed presentations include patients with additional vascular or Lewy body pathology. More atypical presentations include non-logopenic (semantic, non-fluent agrammatic and unclassifiable) primary progressive aphasia, corticobasal syndrome and cases mixed with normal pressure hydrocephalus. Atypical clinical presentations of Alzheimer’s disease may be more common than previously thought.

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory.

The prevalence and the type of central nervous system (CNS) tissue damage caused by SS are debatable. The wide spectrum of CNS manifestations, different classification criteria used and unclear inclusion or exclusion criteria pose some difficulty reviewing these studies. Careful examination of the SS patients and to be aware of neurological findings which may be associated with suspicious CNS involvement is highly important. Central nervous system may also hypothetically have a role in the pathophysiology of SS. The wide spectrum of CNS involvement includes focal (sensorial and motor deficits, brain stem, cerebellar lesions, seizure, migraine etc.) or non-focal (encephalomyelitis, aseptic meningitis, neuropsychiatric dysfunctions), spinal cord (myelopathy, transverse myelitis, motor neuron disease etc.) findings or multiple sclerosis-like illness and optic neuritis. Evolving imaging techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance spectroscopy or magnetization transfer imaging are promising for better understanding the nature of CNS involvement in SS. Treatments usually comprise symptomatic approach in milder cases however, pulse cyclophosphamide and steroids or other immunosuppressants (chlorambucil or azathioprine) are required in cases with progressive symptoms leading to neurological impairment. Anti-TNF agents (infliximab and etanercept) and B cell targeted therapies (rituximab and epratuzumab) are used in primary SS however their efficacy on CNS manifestation is still unclear. Randomized, multicenter studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy of treatment regimes which were reported to be effective in anecdotal reports or in small uncontrolled series.

      "abstract": "The peripheral nerves consist of bundles of long neuronal axons as they exit the central nervous system (CNS). Some peripheral nerves are wrapped in a myelin sheath generated by Schwann cells, whereas others are unmyelinated. Peripheral nerves serve different motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. The term peripheral neuropathy is usually used to describe symmetric and universal damage to adjacent nerves. The damage and clinical manifestations are usually located distally with a proximal progression. Several disorders can damage peripheral nerves and cause peripheral neuropathy; it is important to differentiate actual neuropathy from other disorders that can have a similar clinical presentation [1]. The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy necessitates a thorough workup of possible etiologies to identify immune-mediated causes that are amenable to immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. Importantly, patients may occasionally suffer from more than one disease-causing their peripheral neuropathy. Clinically relevant co-comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, chronic alcohol abuse, etc. need to be considered. Evidence-based guidelines and diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy have been published for specific neuropathic phenotypes such as distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy, small fiber neuropathy, or inflammatory neuropathies. However, they are only applicable for specific neuropathic conditions or when a specific diagnosis is already suspected on clinical grounds. By focusing on the initial steps of the diagnostic workup, this standard operating procedure provides a practical guideline including clinical and additional diagnostic parameters that help to identify the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy [2].",

In contrast, seizures represent an excitatory response tobrain insult or injury. Seizures may complicate trauma, medical illness, or almost any braindisorder. They may also occur in the absence of any discernable brain insult or abnormality(aside from the presence of the seizures themselves). Seizures range from violent convulsionsto clinically enigmatic behavioral changes, diagnosed as seizures only by electroencephalo-graphy. The life-time probability of having a seizure is 5-10%. The prevalence of epilepsy is0.5-1% (1). Seizures are relatively common occurrences in acutely ill patients and occur in3.4% of patients admitted to a medical ICU for nonneurologic reasons (2).",

      "title": "Disorders of attention: a frontier in neuropsychology",
      "abstract": "There is an extensive behavioural neurological literature on so-called unilateral attentional disorders, but a striking paucity of papers on global disorders of attention, i.e. confusional states. However, confusional states are distinctive because: (1) they are the most common disturbance of the higher functions in clinical practice, by orders of magnitude; (2) they are the only disturbance of the higher functions from which all normal subjects have suffered; (3) they have characteristic clinical manifestations; (4) they are frequently misdiagnosed as progressive dementias, aphasia, memory disorders, and psychoses; (5) they are the only disturbance of the higher functions that commonly cause patients to produce statements that appear to be extremely witty; (6) they can be readily studied experimentally; (7) they are the most common cause of unconcern with or denial of illness. There are almost certainly several different forms of confusional state depending on the aetiology, the rate of development, the age, and the anatomical systems involved, but little classification has yet been carried on. Confusional states are most simply defined as disorders in which there is a loss of the normal coherence of thought or action. Among the striking clinical features are: (1) failure to pay attention, excessive distractibility, or failure to shift attention; (2) paramnesias, i.e. distortions of memory; (3) reduplicative phenomena, ‘wild’ paraphasias with ‘propagation’ of error, alterations of mood in many different directions; (4) isolated or predominant disturbance of writing (the most common cause of pure agraphia); (5) unconcern with or denial of illness; (6) apparently playful behaviour. While confusional states are usually attributed to ‘global involvement of the brain’ as a result of metabolic or toxic disorder, there are in fact many cases produced by focal infarctions in the right hemisphere, which, in the experience of my department, is one of the commonest effects of cerebrovascular disease. Brief reference is made to the prognosis, and to the theoretical significance for cerebral dominance and the evolutionary development of cerebral dominance in non-human species.",

Epidemiology PrevalenceThe prevalence of delirium varies with the population that is being studied (Fong et al., 2009).Delirium is a relatively common disorder, especially in older people with physical illness (Saxena & Lawley, 2009).Community rates of delirium are reported to vary from 0.4% to 2% (Saxena & Lawley, 2009, Fong et al., 2009).In general hospital setting prevalence of delirium has been reported to range from 11% to 33% on admission (Lindesay et al.,",

These unexplained symptoms include functional neurological symptoms, fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome and other symptoms such as chronic pain, tinnitus and irritable bowel syndrome. Due to the absence of an aetiological framework there are currently no curing and disorder-specific treatments or medical guidelines. Here we review the evidence on an upcoming therapeutic option, non-invasive neuromodulation, as a method of treatment for functional somatic symptoms. Methods A systematic search of the literature was performed with a specific search string. The resulting hits were screened on the inclusion criteria and after full text reading a summary was made of the remaining studies. Results Neuromodulation as a treatment option for unexplained symptoms is under investigation in multiple medical disciplines. While in some symptom categories such as unexplained pain and tinnitus placebo-controlled RCT ‘s are available, case-studies or small groups are reported in other such as irritable bowel syndrome or functional neurological symptom disorder. First results are usually promising and warrant further investigation. Conclusions The literature indicates that various forms of neuromodulation yield positive therapeutic results with very infrequent side effects. The involvement and relevance of a placebo effect is discussed.",

      "abstract": "The lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of inborn organelle disorders, clinically heterogeneous, and biochemically characterized by accumulation of nondegraded macromolecules primarily in the lysosomal and other cellular compartments. Given the common and essential cellular function of the lysosomal system in different organs and systems, patients afflicted with these disorders present a broad range of clinical problems, including neurological problems, visceromegaly, and skeletal deformities. Onset of symptoms may range from fetal period to adulthood. The neurological problems include developmental delay, seizures, acroparesthesia, motor weakness, muscle wasting, behavioral/psychiatric disturbances, cerebrovascular ischemic events, and extrapyramidal signs. Patients may present with symptoms later that include psychiatric manifestations, are slowly progressive, and may precede other neurologic or systemic features. Most of LSDs are autosomal recessive; however, a few are X-linked with symptpmatic female carriers (e.g., Fabry disease). In most of them, the diagnosis is established by biochemical and/or molecular assays. In terms of management, disease-modifying therapies include enzyme replacement, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and substrate reduction therapy. Patients and their families require genetic counseling regarding reproductive risks, disease prognosis, and therapeutic options. Investigations of disease molecular mechanisms provide insights into potential targets for the development of therapeutic strategies. Supportive care has been the key and essential for most LSDs, resulting in substantial improvement in quality of life of patients and families.",

NMS are associated with wide-ranging abnormalities in extranigral dopaminergic systems and non-dopaminergic (e.g. cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic) systems. The type and severity of NMS vary based on age, disease severity and predominant motor symptoms. NMS can be disabling and reduce quality of life. Treatment of NMS can be challenging. Some NMS are helped by dopaminergic treatment, whereas others can be induced or exacerbated by treatments that help the motor dysfunction.

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and affect the health of billions of people. Previous publications have demonstrated that neuropsychiatric disorders can cause histomorphological damage in particular regions of the brain. By using a clinical symptom-comparing approach, 55 neuropsychiatric signs or symptoms related usually to 14 types of acute and chronic brain insults were identified and categorized in the present study. Forty percent of the 55 neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms have been found to be commonly shared by the 14 brain insults. A meta-analysis supports existence of the same neuropsychiatric signs or symptoms in all brain insults. The results suggest that neuronal damage might be occurring in the same or similar regions or structures of the brain. Neuronal cell death, neural loss and axonal degeneration in some parts of the brain (the limbic system, basal ganglia system, brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex) might be the histomorphological basis that is responsible for the neuropsychiatric symptom clusters. These morphological alterations may be the result of secondary neuronal damage (a cascade of progressive neural injury and neuronal cell death that is triggered by the initial insult). Secondary neuronal damage causes neuronal cell death and neural injury in not only the initial injured site but also remote brain regions. It may be a major contributor to subsequent neuropsychiatric disorders following brain insults.",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

They are grouped under the heading ''beha- vioural and psychological symptoms of dementia'' (BPSD). They must be carefully assessed and treated because they make the prognosis worse (acceleration of cognitive decline), have a detrimental effect on quality of life (for both patient and relatives) and increase the cost of the disease. They must be distinguished from confusion and disorders related to another organic or iatrogenic condition. They can be explained by underlying psychological reactions or neurobiological disturbances. A multimode therapeutic approach is indicated accompanied by research into possible clinicoanatomic correlations. We can distin- guish them arbitrarily according to the following headings: delusion and personality disorders, hallucinations, various kinds of agitation, aggressivity, anxiety, compulsions, disinhibition, apathy, hyperactivity, depression, elimination disorders, sexual disorders, eating disorders, circadian rate/ rhythm disturbances and sleep disorders. If we are to recognise them we must be better informed about their specific attributes.",

      "title": "Prognosis in nonconvulsive status epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Determining the prognosis in nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is complicated by several factors: under-recognition of NCSE with its spontaneous resolution (thus decreasing the denominator of total cases that will have a poor outcome); incorrect diagnosis of NCSE based on misinterpretation of EEG epileptiform activity; mis-classification of certain EEG patterns as NCSE (e.g. PLEDs; triphasic waves); and grouping of different populations that have markedly different co-morbidities (ambulatory patients with NCSE together with comatose patients with electrographic seizure activity on EEG). There are almost no prospective studies with premorbid neuropsychometric studies, and retrospective studies typically include isolated cases, or case series that include conditions in which the cause of NCSE itself causes cognitive morbidity. To summarize available data, absence status (ambulatory generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus) would appear to carry no lasting morbidity. Complex partial status epilepticus in ambulatory patients rarely results in measurable permanent neurologic deficit, although rarely, short or long-standing deficits may clearly occur. Because intensive treatment with intravenous anticonvulsants (e.g. benzodiazepines or phenytoin) can confer morbidity, the equation has not yet been made as to whether the morbidity of such intensive treatment for all cases of NCSE exceeds the morbidity of the disease itself. Larger, prospective studies will be needed to truly determine the prognosis in the different types of NCSE, stratified according to associated degrees of impairment (minimally impaired, moderately obtunded, comatose).",

      "abstract": "Various research studies show that the amalgam of disordered sleep physiology, chronic fatigue, diffuse myalgia, and cognitive and behavioural symptoms constitutes a non-restorative sleep syndrome that may follow a febrile illness, as in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Where rheumatic complaints are prominent such a constellation of disturbed sleep physiology and symptoms also characterizes the fibromyalgia disorder. In contrast to the chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia is associated with a variety of initiating or perpetuating factors such as psychologically distressing events, primary sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder) and inflammatory rheumatic disease, as well as an acute febrile illness. The chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia have similar disordered sleep physiology, namely an alpha rhythm disturbance (7.5–11 Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep that accompanies increased nocturnal vigilance and light, unrefreshing sleep. Aspects of cytokine and cellular immune functions are shown to be related to the sleep-wake system. The evidence suggests a reciprocal relationship of the immune and sleep-wake systems. Interference either with the immune system (e.g. by a viral agent or by cytokines such as α-interferon or interleukin 2) or with the sleeping-waking brain system (e.g. by sleep deprivation) has effects on the other system and will be accompanied by the symptoms of the chronic fatigue syndrome.",

Psychological problems and/or secondary gain are associated factors, suggesting the lack of a physical disorder. Recent findings on the neural mechanisms of pain, indicate that there may be some individuals whose traumatic event may have sensitized certain neurophysiologic processes to interpret as pain, from experiences of otherwise ordinary sensory-perception events. These central sensitization events could be caused or aggravated by various combinations of trauma, psychological disorders, or secondary gain and may provide at least a partial explanation of why some persons may develop chronic pain, and others will not.",

Resultados Foram selecionados 55 artigos. O insight no TB parece ser mais prejudicado do que na depressão unipolar, porém menos do que na esquizofrenia. Com relação ao TB, um menor nível de insight está relacionado à presença de sintomas psicóticos e de alterações cognitivas. Além disso, um comprometimento do insight está associado a uma menor adesão ao tratamento. Por outro lado, uma maior preservação do insight pode estar associada a maior ideação suicida.

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

      "title": "‘Diagnostic overshadowing’: worse physical health care for people with mental illness",
      "abstract": "It is now well established that people with mental illness die prematurely and have significantly higher medical co-morbidity compared with the general population (1), and that there are a number of possible reasons for this as discussed by Leucht et al. in the November issue 2007 of the Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica (2). One of these may be ‘diagnostic overshadowing’, a process by which physical symptoms are misattributed to mental illness. This concept has received little attention in the psychiatric literature but mental health service users have reported its widespread occurrence (3) and its potential impact has been emphasized in two recent reports (4, 5). The term ‘diagnostic overshadowing’ was first used in 1982 to refer to the tendency for clinicians to attribute symptoms or behaviours of a person with learning disability to their underlying cognitive deficits and hence to under-diagnose the presence of co-morbid psychopathology (6). Possible explanatory factors for the ‘overshadowing’ include those related to the disorder (e.g. severity, specific psychiatric conditions), those related to the patient (e.g. degree of cognitive impairment) or those related to the clinician (e.g. years of experience, cognitive complexity) (7). The majority of studies investigating this phenomenon find ‘overshadowing’ to exist, irrespective of such variables. One exception is the ‘cognitive complexity’ of the clinician, which refers to the tendency of the clinician to view a presenting problem in a ‘multi-dimensional fashion’. Clinicians who have greater ‘cognitive complexity’ have been reported to be more likely to detect co-morbid psychopathology. There are limitations of such research. Most studies use clinical vignettes; so, the findings may be the result of a methodological artefact. However, despite possible limitations, such research is a starting point in trying to understand possible differences in clinical decision making for different patient groups. Similar methods of research have been used to examine possible disparate care in other minority groups. However, whereas the focus in the learning disability research has been whether physical diagnoses are missed because of falsely attributing symptoms to the underlying learning disability, research of other minority groups has focussed more on possible bias or discrimination in diagnostic or treatment decisions because of race, gender or age. More sophisticated methods have been used in this research. In one study, investigators examined whether clinicians’ recommendations for cardiac catheterization differed according to the race and gender of the patient (8). Rather than using simple vignettes, they video-recorded actors portraying patients with particular types of chest pain. The study found strong evidence that African-American women were less likely to be referred for catheterization than white men and the authors concluded that the ethnic group and gender of a patient could independently influence diagnosis and recommendations for interventional treatment. Another study showed that particular ethnic groups (African-Americans and Latinos) were less likely to be referred to hospital or to have investigative or treatment procedures, after controlling for diagnosis, severity of illness and access to care (9). It also found there was little evidence to suggest that patient preference explained such disparities, and suggested that the doctor–patient interaction was likely to be a critical factor. Following such studies, there have been attempts to more closely examine the clinical encounter between doctor and patient as a possible source of disparity in minority groups. One such paper proposed three possible mechanisms: prejudice of doctors, communication difficulties or clinical uncertainty associated with different interpretation of symptoms in a minority group, and stereotypes about health-related behaviour in minority groups (10). Another study with potential relevance to patients with mental illness, showed that doctors are more likely to view patients positively and to involve them more in treatment decisions if they perceive the patient to have a positive affect, to be less contentious or to be more likely to adhere to treatment (11). Many of these issues need consideration when trying to understand the phenomenon of ‘diagnostic overshadowing’ in people with mental illness. It cannot be viewed simply as doctors missing symptoms because they are assumed to relate to their psychiatric disorder or because of a doctor’s lack of knowledge about how a psychiatric condition may present. Similarly, it would be too simplistic to suggest that ‘diagnostic overshadowing’ is only because of bias or discriminatory attitudes. While it is likely that such reasons might be involved in some cases, a range of other factors related to the communication between doctor and patient may also be relevant. There is a need for research to better understand these potential contributing factors and how they may relate to higher mortality and morbidity in people with mental illness. Although the causes of different patterns of care are likely to be complex, there has been little attempt to empirically examine how clinicians’ decision making regarding physical diagnosis and treatment may be influenced by the presence of a mental illness in their patients. We are not aware of any studies that specifically investigate possible reasons for missed or incorrect diagnosis of physical illnesses in people with mental illness. However, some research on treatment of physical health problems in those with mental illness show results similar to the results of some of the studies in other minority groups. For example, two studies have shown that people with mental illness and ischaemic heart disease requiring hospitalization were less likely to have a revascularization procedure (12, 13). Similarly, people with co-morbid mental illness and diabetes who presented to an emergency department were less likely to be admitted to hospital for diabetic complications than those with no mental illness (14). This difference was not found across all mental health conditions: those people with non-psychotic illnesses were significantly less likely to be admitted to hospital compared with people with no mental illness, while those with psychosis were not less likely to be admitted to hospital. Another study found that people with schizophrenia who were admitted to medical and surgical wards were found to have significantly higher rates of infections, post-operative complications (including intensive care unit admission or death) and increased length of stay (15). These findings raise further questions about the possibility of disparate treatment for certain types of mental illness. Such research suggests that when considering the issue of less and worse physical care in people with mental illness, both diagnosis and treatment needs to be considered. ‘Treatment overshadowing’ is a term, which has been proposed to describe possible biases in actual treatment decisions (7). Such a term needs to include all components of a treatment plan that can be overlooked, such as an unwillingness to address possible barriers to appropriate care. A combined term of ‘diagnostic and treatment overshadowing’ may be more helpful when planning future research, so that a broader range of possible causes for disparate care are considered. Future research into this area needs to investigate how often physical diagnoses are missed in people with mental illness, examine the impact of such errors and explore why this occurs. Explanatory factors may include some clinicians’ limited knowledge about mental illness, their discomfort in dealing with people with mental illness and other staff attitudes. From the Disability Rights Commission report (4), it seems that the risk of ‘diagnostic overshadowing’ may also be more problematic in certain medical settings. For example, emergency departments were one setting in which service users reported feeling that their physical problems were consistently attributed to mental illness without sufficient assessment. Discrimination can also occur by failing to try to overcome some of the potential barriers to optimal care which may exist. Research into the size of this problem, why it occurs and how it can be addressed is also needed. Consideration of research that has examined such issues in different racial groups may be helpful. For example, several studies have examined patients’ perceptions of quality of care in a number of different domains (e.g. information provided, access to care, co-ordination of care, confidence in the service provider) and have considered ways treatment may be adapted according to different patterns of service use (16, 17). In conclusion, the concept of ‘diagnostic (and treatment) overshadowing’ in patients with mental illness seems to be an important under-investigated problem. There is an opportunity to build on a body of research from the learning disability and medical fields, to try to understand its potential role in the poor physical outcomes in people with co-morbid mental illness. Such research should consider reasons for its occurrence and possible preventative measures, so we can minimize this phenomenon in future.",

      "title": "Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The term \"brain death\" (BD) is used to indicate a clinical situation characterized by the irreversible loss of all brain functions; the identification of this condition is closely linked to the development of intensive care medicine that, with mechanical ventilation, allows the maintenance of somatic functions even when cerebral functions are ceased. BD diagnosis is essentially based on the presence of three cardinal clinic criteria: 1) coma or unresponsiveness, 2) absence of brainstem reflexes 3) absence of spontaneous breathing, evaluated with apnea test. For BD diagnosis the following prerequisites must be scrupolously considered: knowledge of the proximate cause of coma and confirmation of its irreversibility; exclusion of confounding clinical variables (severe electrolyte, acid-base, endocrine disturbances); hypothermia and/or hypotension; drug intoxication or poisoning. Ancillary tests used in BD confirmation are represented by neurophysiological methods to highlight the loss of bioelectrical brain activity (EEG, evoked potential (EP)) and methods for demonstration of cerebral circulatory arrest (TransCranial Doppler (TCD); Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT); conventional Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA); CT angiography; MRI angiography). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ancillary tests are able to confirm the complete cessation of all brain functions and then, in adults, ancillary tests are not needed for the clinical diagnosis of brain death and they should never replace the clinical neurological examination. However, even though ancillary tests are not mandatory but only optional in many countries, they continue to be used, especially when there are factors that may interfere with the complete clinical assessment or when apnea test cannot be performed. Although BD is a relatively simple clinical diagnosis, there are substantial differences in perceptions and practices regarding its declaration among countries, states and even between hospitals worldwide. There are also cultural and religious obstacles—especially in lower-income countries—to the determination of death with neurologic criteria, which lead to the suspension of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, health organizations should implement educational campaigns to improve knowledge and awareness of current criteria among the population, and national and international scientific societies should also make every efforts to validate and standardize clinical and laboratory criteria. Finally, it should reminded and underlined that the ultimate purpose of brain death determination should be to increase the number of organs donated, to improve the quality of life of organ recipients.",

Here we review the most recent findings supporting the hypothesis that major depression is a medical illness of the brain which can be elicited by neurological illnesses.In the last year major improvements in brain-imaging techniques allowed correlations to be demonstrated between functional and structural brain abnormalities in specific brain areas (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus) and the presence and severity of affective disorders, thus suggesting a neural basis for their onset and progression. Similar lesions, caused by neurological diseases, have been found to correlate with the presence of depression in neurological illnesses, but literature on the topic is still lacking. Depression in neurological disorders responds to the same treatments available for idiopathic major depression, but patients seem to have different sensitivities to side effects depending on their specific neurological syndrome. Most available data come from case reports and open trials.'Psychiatric' and 'neurologic' depression seem to share common abnormalities in specific brain areas, but sound brain-imaging studies of the neural correlates of depression in neurological disorders are still lacking. Available treatments are efficacious, but no clear-cut guidelines about the best drugs and dosages can be defined because double-blind placebo-controlled studies are still scarce.",

Recent studies indicate that impairment of the normal structure and function of microglia, caused by either intense inflammatory activation (e.g., following infections, trauma, stroke, shortterm stress, autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases) or by decline and senescence of these cells (e.g., during aging, Alzheimer's disease, or chronic unpredictable stress exposure), can lead to depression and associated impairments in neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Accordingly, some forms of depression can be considered as a microglial disease (microgliopathy), which should be treated by a personalized medical approach using microglial inhibitors or stimulators depending on the microglial status of the depressed patient.",

In some cases the disorder of a somatic system plays an important etiological rôle; in some cases there are definite emotional idiosyncrasies; in some patients special experiences have sensitized the patient in certain directions; in some there has been, even with fair equipment and with no obvious disorder of the simple emotional reactions, a balance impossible to maintain for an indefinite period. In some there are personal traits of very special nature which cannot be reduced to simpler elements. In the formulation of each case one must take into account the possibility of a disorder at each of many levels. In working at this large group of patients we still require very much more information as to the rôle played by the simple organic functions, while not neglecting the complicated development of elaborate psychological reactions. The detailed analysis of the special determination of the specific psychological reactions has been carried further than the other lines of investigation, owing to the enthusiasm of the psychoanalytic school. There remains much work to be done in regard to the rôle of the various systems (cardio-vascular, gastro-intestinal, etc.) in the setting of the emotional reactions; and the study of the personality along lines analogous to those suggested by Hoch and Amsden is an important field for further research.",

Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder.

The complications of occupational exposure to neurotoxins and putative neurotoxins are also covered in so far as they relate to the fitness of an exposed employee to continue working. In addition to a few well-known and common conditions, many uncommon but distinct neurological disorders may present at work or affect work capacity. Fitness for work in these disorders will be determined by the person’s functional abilities, any co-morbid illness, the efficacy or side effects of the treatment, and psychological and social factors, rather than by the precise diagnosis. This will also need to be put into the context of the job in question, as the basic requirements for a manual labouring job may be completely different from something more intellectually demanding. Indeed, even an apparently precise diagnostic label such as multiple sclerosis can encompass a complete spectrum of disability, from someone who is entirely asymptomatic to another who is totally incapacitated. Furthermore, reports by general practitioners, neurologists, or neurosurgeons may describe the symptoms, signs, and investigations in detail, but without analysing functional abilities. These colleagues may also fail to appreciate the workplace hazards, the responsibilities of the employer, or what scope exists for adaptations to the job or workplace.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

Myotonic dystrophy is characterized neither by intellect outside the range of normal (except in those infrequent cases of neonatal myotonic dystrophy) nor by intellectual deterioration. Apparent cognitive deficits more likely result from reversible neuroamine dysfunction associated with a biological depressive illness that may be an intrinsic part of the disorder of myotonic dystrophy. Much of the purported emotional problems, “personality disturbances and social deterioration”, represent symptomatology of this biological depressive illness. This depressive component seems to be responsive to tricyclic antidepressant treatment; such pharmacotherapy also provides additional benefit to other symptoms including gastrointestinal dysfunction, hypersomnia, myotonia, and muscular weakness. It seems probable that the basic genetic defect (possibly involving membrane structure) in myotonic dystrophy results in abnormal aminergic and peptidergic receptors and that dysfunction of the limbic system of the brain is only one of many disturbances caused by the receptor abnormalities.",

      "abstract": "Extract Key points ... Introduction Acute or subacute autonomic failure can be caused by certain drugs and toxins or in association with systemic disorders that affect the nerves more diffusely (e.g. diabetes, amyloidosis). Once these causes are excluded, many cases of acute or subacute autonomic failure may be attributed to autoimmunity targeting the autonomic nerves and/or ganglia. In addition to the time course of the symptoms, several clinical observations support this concept. Subacute autonomic failure may occur in association with known autoimmune neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome or acquired neuromyotonia, or may be associated with occult cancer (paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy). When subacute autonomic neuropathy occurs in isolation, the syndrome often follows a viral prodrome, has a monophasic course, and can be associated with elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and neuron-specific autoantibodies. Until recently, subacute idiopathic autonomic neuropathy was considered to be a pure autonomic variant of the Guillain–Barré syndrome, but recent evidence suggests that some cases, at least, may be due to a specific immune response to the α3-type neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in autonomic ganglia. Indeed, an animal model of autonomic failure has been induced by immunization against α3-type neuronal nicotinic AChR. The manifestations of autoimmune forms of peripheral autonomic failure are reviewed in this chapter with special consideration of autonomic dysfunction in cancer patients and the emerging experimental and laboratory evidence for specific autoantibodies in both cancer and non-cancer cases.",

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control.

Their age of onset is extremely wide; patients may die young, or there may be lifelong motor disability with cardiorespiratory complications, or late onset muscle weakness. About 50 000 people in the UK population of 60.5 million have one of the diverse group of genetic and acquired conditions which make up the primary muscle diseases; many more have muscle symptoms due to drugs or systemic diseases such as cancer. The important acquired muscle diseases include the inflammatory myopathies which are treatable and so the diagnosis must not be missed (or overdiagnosed and some other disorder treated inappropriately), as well as the drug-induced myopathies. Neurologists are also often asked to assess patients with secondary muscle dysfunction due to aging, immobility, critical illness and cancer. Distinguishing myopathies from peripheral neuropathies, anterior horn cell diseases (eg, motor neuron disease) and neuromuscular junction disorders (eg, myasthenic syndromes) requires careful clinical evaluation supplemented by investigations, which may include peripheral neurophysiology, imaging, muscle biopsy and genetic testing. ### Clues from the history #### Age of onset #### Childhood features #### Family history #### Rate of progression and temporal pattern of weakness",

This motor disturbance can be observed in a variety of clinical conditions, that can range from physiological NM, occurring when falling asleep or after prolonged exercise, to asterixis, a form of NM observed in patients with toxic-metabolic encephalopathies or with focal brain lesions, or, as a paroxysmal phenomenon, labelled as epileptic negative myoclonus, in epileptic patients. Neurophysiological investigations are essential to diagnose NM and to distinguish it from other motor disorders, such as tremor or positive myoclonus. Furthermore, neurophysiological findings can provide useful information supporting a subcortical or cortical origin of NM. In cortical NM, recent data suggest a role of cortical active inhibitory areas in the generation of this motor phenomenon.",

The identification of a specific neuronal antibody (NA) is not mandatory to diagnose AE. Moreover, even when a NA is detected, the clinical picture can be inconsequential (i.e., GAD-65) and not disease-specific (i.e., LGI1). Peculiar clinical manifestations and specific alterations of conventional tests as cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be sufficient to confirm the diagnostic suspicion of AE. New-onset seizures may be the first manifestation of AE and require immediate treatment. We report the case of a 19-year-old woman with sudden onset of focal motor seizures with unimpaired awareness, resistant to different intravenous antiseizure medications (ASMs). Ancillary tests (MRI, CSF analysis and electroencephalogram) were pathological and compatible with an autoimmune disorder of the brain. A weak positivity of GluR-3 antibody was detected in low serum dilution along with very high levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme in serum. After administration of high-dose corticosteroids, electro-clinical and neuroradiological pictures progressively normalized. This case report suggests that, even without a definite NA positivity, an inflammatory brain disorder of suspected autoimmune etiology should be considered based on clinical assessment and suggestive ancillary tests.",

However, mostly due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and the complexity of the underlying comorbidities, depression can be difficult to diagnose, resulting in limited recognition and in undertreatment. The early detection and treatment of depression simultaneously with the neurological disorder is key to avoiding deterioration and further disability. Although the neurologist should be able to identify and treat depression initially, a neuropsychiatry team should be available for severe cases and those who are unresponsive to treatment. Neurologists should be also aware that in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, different depression symptoms could develop at different stages of the disease. The treatment options for depression in neurological diseases include drugs, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and somatic interventions, among others, but often, the evidence-based efficacy is limited and the results are highly variable. Here, we review recent research on the diagnosis and treatment of depression in the context of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and strokes, with the aim of identifying common approaches and solutions for its initial management by the neurologist.",

      "title": "Review of Association Between Delirium and Dementia in Elderly People",
      "abstract": "Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, characterized by an acute change in mental status with a fluctuating course of symptoms, that affects almost 50% of people aged 65 years or older, admitted to hospital. Delirium is associated with negative outcomes, including increased risk of mortality, cognitive and functional decline. In 50% of the cases, the cause of delirium is multifactorial, resulting from a complex inter-relationship between several predisposing factors (e.g. advanced age, dementia) in highly vulnerable patients that are exposed to precipitating factors (e.g. infections). In this context, cognitive impairment and dementia are important risk factors for delirium, increasing its risk by two to five times, associated with worse outcomes. The underlying brain vulnerability of these patients with dementia may predispose to the development of delirium, as a consequence of insults related to the acute medical disease, medication or environmental factors. On the other hand, delirium may cause permanent neuronal damage, which may lead to the development or worsening of a pre-existing dementia. As a result, delirium and dementia frequently coexist and overlap, challenging differential diagnosis. The identification of risk factors for delirium, specifically pre-existing cognitive impairment or dementia, in elderly people admitted to hospital is essential to the implementation of preventive strategies that may contribute to the decrease of delirium rates. The present literature review aims to highlight the association between delirium and dementia in elderly people, focusing on diagnosis, pathophysiology, prevention, and management.

The elderly also face a high level of psychosocial and physical stress. In addition, the clinical presentation may be complex and difficult to diagnose, as many of the classical signs and symptoms may be absent or exacerbated. Many of the diagnostic norms may not apply to the elderly, as the concept of being well differs when comparing young with older people. Drug effects in the elderly fluctuate and are much more unpredictable. The elderly patient may present in a confusional state caused by unexplained drug effects. For varying reasons, elders suffer from unwanted drug effects more frequently than do younger adult patients. Assessment of the health status of the elderly must be based on the understanding that problems of living, general health factors, diseases of adaptation, and a decrease in the efficiency of several organ systems combine to determine that status.",

This chapter provides differential diagnosis for specific conditions such as cerebral hemispheric lesions, spinal cord disorders, anterior horn cell disorders, nerve root disorders, neuromuscular junction disorders, and myopathies. In the emergency department, the most serious presentation of severe muscle weakness is acute respiratory failure. The three most common primary neurological causes of acute respiratory failure are previously unrecognized amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myasthenia gravis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Psychiatric causes to be ruled out include schizophrenia; depression, including mania; dementia and delirium; paranoid state; and late-life delusional disorder. Perhaps the most common etiology is cognitive impairment, generally attributable to Alzheimer's disease or multi-infarct dementia. Organic or toxic etiologies need to be ruled out, especially in persons with visual hallucinations. Drug toxicity, a structural brain lesion, or a subtle seizure disorder should be considered. If symptoms are not alleviated when psychosocial triggers or underlying toxic, organic, or medical causes are addressed, patients may respond to supportive therapy and low doses of high-potency neuroleptics. The clinician should keep in mind that older adults are highly sensitive to the side effects of these agents.",

Brain damage: Damage to the brain, especially damage to areas responsible for balance control, such as the brain stem, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum, can cause imbalances. Nervous system problems: Nervous system problems can cause imbalances by causing problems in communicating with your body’s sensory information and motor functions. Medication side effects: Some medications can cause symptoms such as dizziness or unsteadiness as a side effect. Eye disorders: Visual disturbances, especially problems with coordination between the eyes or damage to the retina, can cause imbalances.

RESULTATER RESULTATER Eksekutiv svikt er en vanlig form for slagrelatert kognitiv dysfunksjon. Den sameksisterer ofte med emosjonell instabilitet og depresjon og er en viktig risikofaktor for tap av selvhjulpenhet og for redusert overlevelse. Diagnostikken er basert på anamnese og observasjon, supplert med kognitive tester. Eksekutiv svikt forekommer også hos personer uten distinkte kliniske hendelser, men med bildediagnostiske tegn på cerebral iskemi, og ved andre hjernesykdommer som Parkinsons sykdom og demenssykdommer. Anatomisk substrat for eksekutiv funksjon er i hovedsak prefrontal cortex og subkortikale baner, men slik svikt ses også ved lesjoner i andre hjerneområder. I behandlingen legges det vekt på kompenserende strategier og gjenvinning av tapt funksjon. FORTOLKNING FORTOLKNING Eksekutiv svikt er vanlig ved slagrelatert kognitiv svikt, og tilstanden påvirker prognosen.

      "title": "Distinguishing subclinical (subthreshold) depression from the residual symptoms of major depression.",
      "abstract": "The terms ‘sub-clinical’ or ‘subthreshold’ are widely used in medicine to label individuals who are in the early stages of a disease process (e.g., cancer, hypertension, etc.) and to identify high-risk populations that need to be monitored or provided with specific preventative interventions or treatments. Because the pathophysiological changes that occur in the sub-clinical stages of a condition are similar to those that occur during the full-blown disease, sub-clinical states are usually considered prodromal versions of the disease under consideration.\r\n\r\nBased on this usage, subclinical or subthreshold depression should refer to an individual who has not previously met full criteria for major depression who currently experiences depressive symptoms that are not severe enough or persistent enough to merit a diagnosis of major depression. Using this concept, a recent two-year follow-up study found that subthreshold depression can predict the subsequent occurrence of depressive disorders (OR=6.23, 95% CI=3.31-11.74) or anxiety disorders (OR=3.47, 95% CI= 1.78-6.78).[1]\r\n\r\nUnlike other medical disciplines, in clinical psychiatry the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels are also used to describe residual clinical states after the partial remission of a full episode of a condition. For example, ‘sub-clinical depression’ is often used to describe the clinical state of a patient who has not entered full remission and still has residual symptoms after treatment with antidepressants.[2],[3] I believe it important to distinguish these two situations. Prodromal depressive symptoms prior to the onset of a full-criteria major depression and the residual depressive symptoms after the partial resolution of a major depressive episode may be symptomatically similar but they are clinically distinct conditions that require different interventions so it is inappropriate to combine them under a single label. Residuals symptoms following a major depressive illness require continued pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatment but sub-clinical depressive symptoms prior to the first occurrence of a major depressive illness usually only require observation and follow-up. More active treatment for sub-clinical depressive symptoms is usually only justified if they persist for two years or longer (in which case the diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder is usually applied) or if the individual has had full-criteria major depressive illness in the past and thus is at a high risk of progressing to a full-criteria episode of illness.\r\n\r\nCollapsing these different situations under a single rubric is both inaccurate and could potentially lead to inappropriate treatment. I recommend that persistent depressive symptoms following a major depressive illness that do not meet the full criteria of the disorder be labeled ‘residual symptoms’ (not sub-clinical or subthreshold symptoms) and that the ‘sub-clinical depression’ or ‘subthreshold depression’ labels be limited to depressive symptoms that occur prior to the first onset of a full depressive episode. But depressive affect is part of the normal human condition so we must also avoid the inappropriate overuse of the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels by, for example, labeling the depressive symptoms identified in screening programs of healthy community members as ‘subthreshold depression’. Depressive symptoms in individuals without prior episodes of full-criteria depressive illness should only be given the sub-clinical or subthreshold labels if the symptoms are ‘clinically significant’, that is, when they result in significant distress or significant social or occupational dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) is a severely under-studied mental disorder, regardless of being relatively as prevalent as other serious mental illnesses (SMI) to the general population, such as schizophrenia and obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD). Due to the nature of the current body of work on the disorder, it's clear there is a need for further research, as there are only a few small scale studies that approach the contradistinction in symptomatology between varying onset triggers. This paper proposes an investigation into whether there is a distinction in severity, duration, and persistence of symptoms between individuals with DPDR triggered by drugs versus non-drug induced cases. The proposed study hypothesizes that symptoms in drug induced individuals will be significantly different from cases induced by other triggers. The outcome of symptoms may depend on many factors, a few such as whether or not an individual continues to experiment with drugs following the development of DPDR, running the risk of re-exposing themselves to a severe episode, whether or not symptoms rooted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) retrigger dissociative episodes, and the potential of co-occurring hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) causing symptoms of perceptual disturbances. The proposed study will use a survey design to collect data from 175 participants, targeting individuals who are currently experiencing DPDR or DPDR-like symptoms, or have recovered from the disorder. Given that significant evidence of distinction is uncovered, this study may be the stepping stone to addressing and developing treatment options for DPDR sufferers in the future.",

The clinical features of delirium predominantly involve subacute changes in cognition, awareness, and activity levels, behavioral disturbance, clouding consciousness, and sleep-wake cycle changes. In contrast, epilepsy involves the acute interruption of brain function, often with convulsive activity, falls, and injury. States that may share the clinical features of both, such as nonconvulsive epileptic states, are also important: the cause of brain derangement is one of excessive and abnormal electrical brain activity. In such conditions, the clinical manifestations may resemble states of delirium and confusion, and the absence of convulsive clinical activity is significant. Electroencephalography remains the diagnostic test of choice: it is essential for differentiating these two conditions, enabling the distinctly different treatments and epilepsy. Ongoing research and investigation are essential to better understand the abnormal brat mechanisms underlying delirium, and to develop better tools for objective diagnosis.",

      "title": "Psychotic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychosis is a severe, acute or chronic mental illness that is characterized by reality distortion, delusions, hallucinations, disorganization, catatonia, and impaired insight. Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When encountering medical symptoms such as motor paralysis, clinicians typically have to distin guish between (at least) two types of potential diagnosis. The first, more traditionally biomedical is that the paralysis originates from some demonstrable pathology of the peripheral or central nervous system; the second does not fulfil this criterion and the paralysis can be broadly considered as an ‘unexplained medical symptom’ or, more specifically, as an ‘unexplained neurological symptom’ (Brown and Ron 2002). Inclusion within this second group, however, could occur for a number of different reasons-none of which is mutually exclusive. It may be that an underlying pathological agent does in fact exist but has yet to be identified. In this case, it may just be a matter of time, test sensitivity and technical breakthrough before a proven physiological abnormality and a relevant causal link will be established. On the other hand, no underlying structural pathology may be",

      "abstract": "Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) is a common condition with a significant impact on quality of life and general health. A mild form of sleepiness can be associated with reduced reactivity and modest distractibility symptoms, but more severe symptomatic forms are characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrollable need to sleep, causing sudden sleep attacks, amnesia and automatic behaviors. The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances. An accurate medical history cannot be sufficient for the differential diagnosis, therefore instrumental recordings by means of polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are mandatory for a correct diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of EDS.",

Most brain injury is a fairly messy affair, usually the result of disease, traumatic injury or cerebrovascular accident.

Usually headache is annoying; sometimes it can be debilitating. In the worst case, but rarely, headache can be a manifestation of a serious underlying condition, such as a brain tumor. The physician's first task is to ascertain whether such a disorder is present. The history will help to determine this, but physical findings are especially important. A physical examination, with special attention to neurologic findings, can detect signs of a disease or disorder. Usually, results of the examination will reassure patient and physician, especially if the headaches have been occurring for many months and the findings are normal. The clinician's next step is to determine the mechanism for the patient's discomfort, which will dictate appropriate therapy.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia in Late Life: Findings Challenge Traditional Concepts",
      "abstract": "Two notions about schizophrenia have persisted: (1) it is characterized by onset in adolescence or early adulthood, and (2) it has a progressively deteriorating course. Recent studies focusing on early-adulthood- and middle-age-onset schizophrenia challenge these views. Patients with early-onset schizophrenia and middle-age-onset schizophrenia (MAOS) are similar in terms of family history of schizophrenia, presence of minor physical anomalies, early childhood maladjustment, severity of positive symptoms, presence of gross structural abnormalities on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, overall pattern of neuropsychologic deficits, and qualitative response to neuroleptic medications. Differences include a higher proportion of women among MAOS patients, and the tendency for MAOS patients to have less severe negative symptoms, better neuropsychologic performance (particularly in learning and abstraction/cognitive flexibility), and possibly larger thalamic volume and to respond to lower doses of neuroleptic medications. While onset of schizophrenia-like symptoms in very late life may reflect an acquired condition that is not \"true schizophrenia,\" and that may be labeled \"very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis,\" findings suggest that true schizophrenia can arise after early adulthood. Middle-age-onset schizophrenia is predominantly neurodevelopmental, but it is also a distinct neurobiological subtype of schizophrenia. Our studies also demonstrate that neuropsychologic functioning remains stable in chronic schizophrenia outpatients, even when observed over several years and in the presence of significant fluctuations in the severity of clinical symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Auteur(s) : Florence Mahieux La sclerose hippocampique (SH) designe une perte de neurones au niveau de l’hippocampe, accompagnee d’une proliferation de cellules gliales. Une SH est frequemment observee lors d’interventions chirurgicales pour epilepsie temporale, mais aussi apres traumatisme crânien, hypoglycemie severe ou arret cardiaque prolonge. Sa presence lors de l’examen neuropathologique de malades dements est signalee depuis de nombreuses annees, au cours de diverses maladies (maladie d’Alzheimer, demence avec corps de Lewy, ou demences dites « sans signe histopathologique distinct ») et, beaucoup plus rarement, de facon isolee (SH « pure ») [1]. Sa frequence varie, selon les series, de 0,4 % a 8 %. La notion de SH « pure » est sujette a discussion en temps qu’entite specifique et n’est pas definie par tous de la meme facon (essentiellement selon le degre de « purete » de l’atteinte). Les tableaux cliniques (succinctement) decrits peuvent etre similaires a ceux d’une maladie d’Alzheimer comme d’une demence frontotemporale. L’origine hypoxique (vasculaire) ou non de cette lesion est egalement l’objet de constatations contradictoires. Deux articles recents offrent une nouvelle piste a notre reflexion, explorant successivement, selon l’angle neurologique et neuropathologique, une serie de 19 cas de SH « pure », issus de la banque de cerveaux de l’hopital John Hopkins de Baltimore, constituee entre 1985 et 2002 [2, 3]. Il faut cependant noter que les dossiers cliniques prealables pouvaient provenir d’unites hospitalieres differentes et ont ete recueillies retrospectivement. Ces cas ont ete compares, pour les donnees cliniques, a 24 cas de demence frontotemporale (DFT) anatomiquement definie, incluant les differentes variantes connues de ce syndrome et 19 cas de maladie d’Alzheimer (MA), apparies pour l’âge, le sexe et l’âge de debut des symptomes. Globalement, la frequence et le spectre des troubles comportementaux des SH etaient similaires a ceux du groupe des DFT (plus grande frequence de l’incurie et des comportements stereotypes, alors que l’apathie, les hallucinations et l’agressivite etaient plus frequents dans la MA). Les troubles neuropsychologiques differenciaient egalement les groupes : la desorientation, les troubles du calcul et l’agnosie etant plus particulierement le fait de la MA. L’apraxie etait significativement plus rare dans la SH, mais le mutisme y etait nettement plus frequent que pour les deux autres groupes. Les troubles de memoire etaient particulierement mal decrits (probablement du fait de la provenance tres diverse des cas), ce qui represente tres clairement une des faiblesses de l’etude. L’analyse en aveugle des dossiers cliniques par un groupe de cliniciens a montre que 57 % des cas de SH etaient compatibles avec un diagnostic de DFT (repartis pour moitie en DFT pure probable et DFT / possible MA). Dans les groupes controles choisis, la sensibilite des criteres cliniques etait de 64 % et la specificite de 74 % ; 1/19 patients MA etant classe comme DFT pure probable et 5 patients du groupe des DFT etant classes comme MA probable et/ou possible.  Le deuxieme article correspondait a une analyse neuropathologique plus poussee de 18 des 19 cas de SH. Chez 11 d’entre eux ont ete retrouvees des inclusions neuronales ubiquitine-positive, generalement considerees comme caracteristiques des demences associees aux atteintes du motoneurone (en rappelant que tous les intermediaires possibles entre SLA cliniquement pure et demence sans atteinte clinique motrice ont ete decrits avec ce type de lesions [4]). La comparaison des patients ayant ces inclusions avec ceux qui en etaient depourvus n’a pas permis de mettre en evidence la moindre specificite clinique. La mesure de la proteine tau, aussi bien sous sa forme soluble (diminuee dans un certain nombre de cas de demence « sans caractere histopathologique distinct ») que sous sa forme insoluble (elevee dans la MA), n’a mis en evidence aucune difference avec les controles.  L’ensemble de ces deux articles suggere que les SH « pures » pourraient s’agglutiner au groupe grandissant des DFT, malgre l’absence de toute anomalie de la proteine tau (elles n’appartiendraient donc pas au cadre des tauopathies). Un certain nombre d’entre elles pourraient relever de la meme etiologie que les demences « associees aux atteintes du motoneurone », sans que ce sous-groupe puisse etre mieux defini. L’origine des troubles cliniques de type frontal n’est par ailleurs pas expliquee, meme si les auteurs avancent l’hypothese d’une deafferentation du cortex orbitofrontal liee a l’atteinte des projections de l’hippocampe.  Ces etudes soulignent par ailleurs la grande difficulte du diagnostic etiologique des demences sur les seules donnees cliniques, un meme syndrome pouvant relever de pathologies tres differentes ayant une meme repartition spatiale. 1.

      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

      "abstract": "Background: Idiopathic longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis is defined as a focal spinal cord lesion that involves three or more segments of the spinal cord as shown by neuroimaging, and results in a profound disability. The clinical picture of a patient with idiopathic longitudinally advanced transverse myelitis is often dramatic and may consist of paraparesis or tetraparesis, sensory disturbances, and pelvic dysfunction. Idiopathic longitudinally advanced transverse myelitis is a common manifestation of the neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, but can also occur in various other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases of the CNS, such as multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, or Sjogrens syndrome, or in infectious diseases involving the CNS. It is less likely to occur in isolation, as the only manifestation of a demyelinating disease of the nervous system of an unknown etiology (idiopathic myelitis).&#x0D; Clinical case description: The clinical observation presented in the article demonstrates the difficulties of establishing a nosological diagnosis in the case of a monophasic course of TM in the absence of other autoimmune and infectious diseases of the central nervous system. The patient with idiopathic longitudinally distributed TM had no visual disturbances and no antibodies to aquaporin 4 and to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-IgG) with twice repeated tests.&#x0D; Conclusion: In this regard, it is important to dynamically monitor the clinical manifestations and MRI signs in patients with an isolated lesion of a demyelinating nature in the form of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis.",

Neuropsychological assessment also enables assessment of the extent of cognitive difficulties that are due to a known neurological event (e.g., stroke or traumatic brain injury) and how the resulting cognitive impairment may affect caregivers and treatment. Neuropsychological assessment typically involves a thorough diagnostic interview with a patient and a caregiver and one to five hours of testing.

      "abstract": "Aim: Conversion disorder is a situation where psychological stress is expressed physically. This health problem is usually triggered by a stressful or a mental crisis. When involving a physical problem it is named as ’conversion disorder’. Psychogenic gait disturbance is a common conversion disorder. Anorexia nervosa is a totally different disease than conversion disorder by its clinical presentation and characteristics. We present a patient suffering from anorexia nervosa and developing conversion disorder in form of a gait disturbance. Presentation of Case: A 35 year-old woman was suffering from excessive obsessions about her body. She had avoidance of eating and loss of 18 kilograms. She was admitted to our hospital for obtaining a disabled certificate for her walking disability that continued for 6 months. Her gait disturbance was indeterminate as to being neurological or orthopedic and was aggravated by stress. Discussion: Even though anorexia nervosa and conversion disorder are two different pathologies, they may be seen together, meaning that patients with one disease may Case Study Balkuv et al.; JSRR, Article no. JSRR.2014.005 584 develop symptoms of another disease as means of secondary gain. However, a psychogenic movement disorder is a rare presentation in this situation. Conclusion: Psychogenic gait disturbances are relatively rare psychogenic movement disorders. Conversion disorder may be the underlying problem. In our case, patient was masking, involuntarily, her primary problem (anorexia nervosa) by attracting attention to her gait. Such situations complicate the diagnosis and treatment of both diseases, which should be kept in mind.",

However, in spite of the application of all sorts of remedial measures, these conditions would somehow fail to respond to any physical therapy so far devised. Recent researches and clinical studies increasingly begin to support the view that purely psychic conditions are capable of producing physical symptoms that cannot be removed or cured by physical, medicinal or mechanical remedies, but only by psychic means directed at the original source of difficulties.

La enfermedad de Alzheimer es una condicion neurodegenerativa  caracterizada por deterioro cognitivo, conductual y del funcionamiento global, con un inicio insidioso y curso progresivo que aparece principalmente en la vejez. Por otro lado, la depresion es un trastorno del estado de animo que en altos niveles de gravedad muestra en adultos mayores alteraciones cognitivas significativas que pueden confundirse con un sindrome demencial. Se reporta el caso de una mujer de 75 anos de edad con datos de un probable trastorno depresivo mayor y con quejas de perdida de memoria desde hace 3 anos. A la evaluacion neuropsicologica se observan alteraciones cognitivas importantes en el funcionamiento mnesico ademas del funcionamiento ejecutivo, caracterizados por: una deficiente capacidad de aprendizaje de nueva informacion con respecto a lo esperado para su edad y nivel de escolaridad, una perdida importante de elementos visuales y auditivos a corto y largo plazo, ademas de una significativa presencia de perseveraciones e intrusiones, con un marcado deficit en el automonitoreo.

      "abstract": "While aging is associated with modest declines in certain aspects of cognitive function (memory, executive function, processing speed), many cognitive domains can remain relatively stable until late in life. In contrast to the mild decline observed in normal aging, pathological aging such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects global cognitive function – impairing memory, language, thinking, and reasoning, and interferes substantially with daily living capacity. Changes in the structural integrity of the brain underlie the cognitive declines that occur in both aging and AD, however different brain structures are affected. In healthy aging, mild functional changes are predominantly detected in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, while in AD, pathology initially accumulates and disrupts function in the medial temporal lobe (disrupting memory), progresses to cortical structures, and eventually globally impacts the brain. Cognitive decline with normal and pathological aging is mediated by a complex interaction of multiple factors that include genetic and nongenetic risk factors that determine the age of onset as well as the rate of decline. Importantly, the progression and decline can be prevented or slowed by certain lifestyle factors (exercise participation, stress management) and pharmaceutical interventions (statins, hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women). While most individuals will experience some degree of cognitive decline with aging, conversion to MCI or AD is not an inevitable consequence of aging. It is likely that additional strategies to promote healthy brain aging will be uncovered in the next years that will further contribute to successful brain aging and will help to maintain a high quality of living through the last decades of life.",

El diagnostico se establece cuando el desarrollo del lenguaje no sigue la pauta de los demas aspectos del desarrollo, y han quedado excluidas otras posibles causas. Desarrollo. Durante los ultimos anos, las neurociencias se han aproximado al estudio del TEL. Se cree que la clave para una adquisicion correcta del lenguaje es la capacidad de procesar dos o mas estimulos auditivos que se presentan en una sucesion rapida. Una hipotesis que se ha planteado es que el TEL es una consecuencia de unas anomalias de bajo nivel en la percepcion auditiva. Ademas, los ninos con TEL manifiestan un deficit especifico en la discriminacion automatica de las silabas. Es posible que los metodos electrofisiologicos revelen una inmadurez u otra anomalia subyacente del procesamiento auditivo, incluso cuando los umbrales conductuales parecen normales. Conclusiones. Hay mucha polemica sobre el papel de dichos deficit en la etiologia de las dificultades linguisticas, y ha sido dificil establecer unos resultados consistentes y repetibles en esta area debido a la heterogeneidad de la poblacion y tambien porque no se ha prestado suficiente atencion a los aspectos relacionados con la maduracion del procesamiento auditivo.",

      "abstract": "Patients with disorders of mood or affect make up a numerically very important part of the psychiatrically ill. To facilitate references to cause, outcome, and results of treatment in clinical situations, a number of classifications of the affective disorders have been proposed. The bases of these classifications are most varied, involving consideration of the extent and nature of the psychopathology present (for example, neurotic versus psychotic depression, agitated depression, retarded depression, smiling depression, hypochrondriacal depression); longitudinal history of the patient (recording, for example, manicdepressive illness, circular type, in a person who, in the course of one or several episodes of illness, has exhibited mood swings to both the manic and the depressive poles, or endogenous-reactive depression, determined on the basis of the presence or absence of clear and meaningful precipating events); and demographic data such as age (pointing, for example, to early onset versus late onset depression, or to involutional depression in illness occurring in elderly males or in menopausal or postmenopausal females). One very important basis of classification that has been largely neglected, but that would have considerable value from an etiologic viewpoint, is a genetic one. There is considerable evidence that genetic factors are important in affective disorders. Winokur & Pitts (1965) found a greater prevalence of both affective disorder and alcoholism in parents of affectively ill patients than in parents of a control group of medical, surgical, and obstetrical patients who had been matched for age, sex, ward versus private-room status, and marital status. These results appear in Table 1, in which it can be seen that for three other psychiatric disordersneurosis, schizophrenia, and chronic brain syndromethere was no significant increase in comparison with the control figures. The finding of a greater prevalence of alcoholism in fathers of affective patients further suggests a genetic trait, according to Hanna (1965), who proposed as one criterion of a",

The diagnosis previously hinged on the neurologist’s demonstration of the lack of disease and the psychiatrist’s hypothesis of a ‘conversion’ of stress into a physical symptom. It is now based on positive findings on neurological assessment supplemented by a psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression disorders are common. Treatment is multi-disciplinary. Explanation of the condition to the patient is a crucial initial step supplemented, where necessary, by psychological treatment (especially for dissociative or non-epileptic attacks) and physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Pain and fatigue are commonly associated with work‐related upper extremity disorders. Occasionally these symptoms persist beyond a reasonable healing period. One potential explanation for prolonged symptom expression is the concurrent development of a stress‐mediated illness or CMI (Chronic Multi‐Symptom Illness). In such a scenario, the chronic regional pain and other symptoms that the individual is experiencing would be attributable to the CMI rather than to tissue damage or a biomechanical dysfunction of the upper‐extremity. Methods This article critically reviews the case definitions of the new class of CMI disorders and evaluates the existing evidence supporting centrally mediated physiological changes (e.g., sensory hypervigilance, dysautonomia) that manifest as symptoms of pain and fatigue in some individuals experiencing chronic stressors. Results While explanations for prolonged pain and fatigue have historically focused on mechanisms involving peripheral pathology or psychiatric explanations, ample evidences support the role of altered Central Nervous System function in accounting for symptom manifestation in CMI. Conclusions A model is presented that unites seemingly disparate findings across numerous investigations and provides a framework for understanding how genetics, triggering events, stressors, and early life events can affect CNS activity. Resultant symptom expression (e.g., pain and fatigue) from central dysregulation would be expected to occur in a subset of individuals in the population, including a subset of individuals with work‐related upper extremity disorders. Thus when symptoms such as pain and fatigue persist beyond a reasonable period, consideration of CMI and associated assessment and interventions focused on central mechanisms may be worthwhile. Am.

Patients with a high degree of medical comorbidity often require inpatient management for evaluation and monitoring of initial treatment.

Depression is highly prevalent in patients with neurological illnesses such as cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and dementia. Psychiatric presentation of depression and psychiatric comorbidity often necessitate inpatient management. Depression with active suicidality, severe anorexia, or presence of psychosis in depressed patients are common indications for hospitalization.

Some involve genetic or metabolic disturbances affecting the muscle directly, some are caused by interruptions to the transmission of impulses at the neuromuscular junction, still others by abnormalities in the muscle nerve supply. Disuse atrophy with profound weakness may be seen in advanced arthritis or in any other condition where chronic pain enforces immobility. There are numerous uncommon syndromes in which muscle weakness is an important component; many of these will come to a specialist neurologist for elucidation. Some weakness is temporary, recovery of strength often occurs in stroke or very commonly in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Cranial motor and peripheral muscular dysfunction in myasthenia gravis may respond to steroids, immuno-suppressants and either plasma exchange or immunoglobulin infusions as well as thymectomy and the use of pyridostigmine. There are presentations of ‘functional’ weakness (often unilateral and sometimes accompanied by sensory symptoms) commonly of prolonged duration, that are little altered by treatment of any kind, but are not readily assigned to any recognizable neurological diagnosis.

Some children may have persistent physical discomfort which can lead to debilitating impact on their academic and social functioning. These children seek repeated medical consultations and are usually subjected to unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures. It is extremely important to understand that emotional factors can contribute to the development as well as maintenance of impairing physical symptoms. There is scientific evidence for the association of anxiety and functional somatic symptoms in children. The diagnostic category which was previously called somatoform disorders is now included in somatic symptom disorders. The main feature of the somatic symptom disorders is the excessive concern with somatic symptoms. These children usually have high level of anxiety. Detailed clinical examination and investigations will not reveal any abnormalities to explain the symptoms. The somatic symptom disorders are common in childhood. Cognitive behavioural therapy by experts in child guidance, will relieve the somatic symptoms related to anxiety and stress. If not intervened at the earliest, the persistent physical symptoms associated with emotional stress will cause significant functional disability in childhood. Unnecessary invasive medical interventions cause more agony to the child. These children also have high risk for developing anxiety disorders and depressive disorders in young adulthood. Hence, early intervention using cognitive behavioural techniques should be provided to all children with somatic symptom disorders, which will definitely improve their quality of life.",

      "title": "Evaluating a Child with Partial Developmental Delay (ParDD), Global Developmental Delay (GDD)/Mental Retardation (MR): Clinical Expertise Based or Evidence-Based?",
      "abstract": "Developmental delay (DD) is a commonly encountered clinical problem. Nearly most children with neurodevelopmental disorders present with developmental delay. The ultimate diagnosis may take months or even years to be confirmed. The final verdict may be purely developmental with a benign outcome, or there might be slow deterioration ending up in a more sinister cause like neurodegenerative diseases. At times, the developmental course might plateau off with the final developmental outcome underachieved. With standardized assessment at a later age, these children could then be labeled as suffering from \"mental retardation (MR) or \"intellectual disability\" (ID). Thus, the crucial issue during the process of making the final diagnosis for any child presenting with developmental delay is when can one decide that an etiological diagnosis can confidently be made during the phase of development. When can one be really sure that there is no underlying organic cause to account for the developmental delay. Often than not, the clinician is faced with the dilemma of how exhaustive one should persue in investigating a case of DD, and when to stop investigating further. It is very important for us to develop a logical and practical approach in managing these DD children at the \"first\" presentation and to establish ones clinical judgment to find the \"Best timing\" for referral or diagnostic workup. The first step to the approach is the awareness and the differentiation of Partial Developmental Delay (ParDD) from Global Developmental Delay (GDD). We aim to provide the readers an understanding of a practical and evidence based approach for the diagnostic evaluation of a child with DD/MR. We hope this approach can help to improve the diagnostic yield of DD/MR.

      "abstract": "Although the majority of epileptics who are well controlled on medication do not show significant evidence of psychopathology, a subset of epileptics have serious psychiatric disturbances. Risk factors for the development of psychopathology appear to include poorly-controlled seizures, a long duration of seizure disorder with onset in childhood, seizure focus in the temporal lobe, bilateral or multiple discharges on EEG, and structural lesions. All of these factors appear to put the patient at greater risk of brain dysfunction, possibly because of the disruption of limbic functions associated with behavior and personality. The onset of seizures in childhood is likely to affect the development of personality and social functioning adversely. Although not a focus of this article, premorbid personality, psychologic reactions to having epilepsy, and the social problems accompanying the disease are likely to contribute greatly to the development of psychopathology. The development of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy thus appears to be a complex, multifactorial process. No single factor, such as seizure type, EEG findings, lateralization, pathology, or demographic variables is likely to be explanatory. Recent research has focused on accounting for many of these factors, and future investigations should shed further light on why some epileptics develop psychiatric problems and how best to treat these disorders.",

A wide range of sporting activities exist where serious injury and death are potential outcomes with risks varying depending on the nature of the underlying activities. The possibility of unexpected collapse and death from occult or diagnosed/treated medical conditions also exists with, for example, exercise adding additional stress to certain cardiovascular conditions provoking lethal arrhythmias. Drug screening should be undertaken at autopsy in deaths related to sports as stimulants such as amphetamines that may have been taken to enhance performance may also have had a cardiotoxic effect. Genetic screening will also be required in certain cases.",

      "abstract": "The commonest and simplest operational definition of consciousness is, the state of the patient’s awareness of self and environment and his responsiveness to external stimulation and inner need. Therefore, unconsciousness has the opposite meaning, that is, a state of unawareness of self and environment or a suspension of those mental activities by which people are made aware of themselves and their environment, coupled with a diminished responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness can have many different causes, for example, stroke, traumatic brain injury, anesthesia, brainstem lesions and sleep, the various causes of unconsciousness primarily interfering with different brain functions. Clinically, impaired consciousness such as coma, vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) is a very common manifestation in subjects with acquired brain injury. Unconsciousness does not always consist of a general suppression of the entire activity of the central nervous system. Depending on the actual cause(s), many functions, such as protective reflexes and various cognitive processes, can remain intact. The Management of such a patient in VS or MCS requires carefully reaching the correct diagnosis, pronouncing an evidence-based prognosis, and thoughtfully considering the medical, ethical, and legal elements of optimum treatment (Bernat, 2006).",

If muscle hypertrophy cannot be attributed to active lifestyle, an underlying neuromuscular pathology should be suspected. The check-up includes a meticulous neurological examination (looking for myotonia, rippling, myoclonus, etc.), a CK level dosage, an electromyography (for myotonic discharges), and, if necessary, it should be completed by muscle biopsy and molecular examinations. Several diagnostic hypotheses should be considered. Most are related to a genetic defect leading to dysfunction of the excitation-contraction coupling in the muscle. The diagnosis of a myotonic syndrome is the most common but caveolinopathy 3, RYR1-related myopathy or Brody’s disease are also possible.",

      "abstract": "Although the risk of developing dementia increases with age, onset can be as early as the third or fourth decade of life. Genetic influences play a more important role in younger than in older people with dementia, so young onset dementia may cluster in families. Diagnosing young onset dementia is challenging. The range of possible presenting features is broad, encompassing behavioural, cognitive, psychiatric and neurological domains, and symptoms are often subtle initially. Frequently the complaints are misattributed to stress or depression, and the patient is falsely reassured that they are too young to have dementia. The most common causes of young onset dementia are early onset forms of adult neurodegenerative conditions and alcohol. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of young onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Conventional vascular risk factors may be absent and diagnosis relies on imaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease. Obtaining a detailed history remains the most important part of the workup and usually requires corroboration by a third party. Undertaking a basic neurological examination is also important. Those with suspected young onset dementia should be referred to a neurology-led cognitive disorders clinic where available as the differenti diagnosis is considerably broader tha in older adults and requires specialist investigation.",

      "abstract": "Depressive disorders--both major depression and other less severe but nonetheless clinically significant depressions--are common comorbidities, components, or complications of dementia. Depression with reversible cognitive impairment may be a prodrome for dementia rather than a separate and distinct disorder. Recent research has demonstrated that both the diagnosis of major depression and the assessment of typical depressive symptoms can be conducted reliably, even in patients with mild-to-moderate levels of cognitive impairment. Self-ratings of depressive symptoms with the Geriatric Depression Scale remain valid in patients with Mini-Mental State Examination scores of at least 15. Among interviewer-administered instruments, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Cornell Scale are the best established. Potential difficulties with assessment include problems with ascertainment (because families, in general, report greater depression in patients than do clinicians) and the ambiguity of symptoms (because apathy and related symptoms can result from both depression and Alzheimer's disease). Brain changes due to Alzheimer's disease may lead to fundamental differences in drug responses. Nevertheless, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that depression in dementia responds to specific psychopharmacologic or psychosocial treatments.",

      "abstract": "References 67Dementia is a fundamentally neuropsychological concept, describing the cognitive and behavioural impact of a brain disorder which brings about an unravelling of the mind's workings: 'neuro' plus 'psychological'. Dementia can be the earliest manifestation of brain illness, and emerging signs of cognitive change often provide the first inkling that something is not quite right. A brief cognitive screening test is usually given by a geriatrician or neurologist and the result may be enlightening, but if the signs are subtle it may not. In any case, if the clinician suspects dementia is a possibility, a neuropsychological referral is often made to characterize any decline in cognition with comprehensive testing based on psychometric principles and with reference to robust normative data sets. The emergence of clinical neuropsychology as a mainstream specialty discipline in hospital outpatient clinics (e.g. so-called 'memory clinics') has allowed for the quantitative evaluation of cognitive decline with the kind of metric resolution which health-care professionals might reasonably expect of an empirical investigation.",

      "abstract": "Cerebrovascular disease is common in the elderly and can cause a wide spectrum of impairments that range from mild to severe. Sensitive and specific definitions of cerebrovascular cognitive impairment are hampered by the fact that cerebrovascular disease is not easily linked to cognitive syndromes, either clinically or pathologically, and the presence of coincident Alzheimer’s disease is common. Importantly, however, it does appear that the dementia caused by brain vascular disease may share similar anatomical substrates with Alzheimer’s disease, supporting the notion of a common substrate to dementia. Treatment of vascular cognitive impairment may need to emphasize primary or secondary prevention of cerebrovascular risk factors such as hypertension, but some symptomatic treatments are beginning to show modest success. Raised awareness of cerebrovascular disease as a cause for cognitive impairment is likely to result in better detection and treatment, leading to improved cognitive health for our aging population. Patients with vascular dementia (VaD) show cholinergic deficits that may result in characteristic clinical syndromes for different subtypes of the condition. Subcortical VaD is characterized by executive dysfunction and behavioral problems, reflecting deterioration of the frontal lobe. It is still under consideration whether cholinesterase inhibitors may have any effects on the typical symptoms of VaD. The authors’ suggestion is that VaD is not a unique pathology: the etiopathogenesis of multi-infarct dementia and that of subcortical VaD are quite different. Future studies need to consider those entities separately to obtain good results, for a group of patients for whom, until now, there have been few therapeutic options.",

O termo Esquizofrenia se refere a um grupo de transtornos caracterizados por sintomas psicóticos positivos em algum estágio da doença, em que mania e depressão grave não são características proeminentes ou persistentes, e onde sintomas negativos e cognitivos são proeminentes e associados a um nível variável de incapacidade (McGorry, 2004). Este diagnóstico compreende um grupo heterogêneo de transtornos psicóticos, que resultam, provavelmente, de alterações neurobiológicas substanciais na função cerebral e em algum grau na estrutura cerebral do indivíduo. Originado do conceito kraepeliniano de demência precoce, seu significado sofreu modificações com o desenvolvimento de novas nosologias (McGorry, 2004). Entretanto, apesar da tentativa de unificar as várias apresentações do transtorno, o curso da esquizofrenia revelou-se heterogêneo e notavelmente diferente de quadros neurológicos mais bem tipificados, como a Doença de Alzheimer. O tratamento dessa condição, muitas vezes, pode ser desafiador, o que demanda do psiquiatra uma adaptação às especificidades de cada caso.

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

      "abstract": "In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), hidden symptoms such as cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction significantly affect quality of life and contribute to disability progression. Despite high prevalence, these symptoms often remain underestimated and underdiagnosed in clinical practice. The pathogenesis of hidden manifestations in MS is multifactorial, involving inflammatory, neurodegenerative, vascular, metabolic, and psychosocial mechanisms. Cognitive impairment in patients with MS most commonly includes decreased information processing, memory deficits, and executive dysfunction. Depression and anxiety frequently co-occur; depressive symptoms are associated with hippocampal changes and cortico-limbic network alterations, while anxiety is linked to dysregulation of limbic structures and neuroinflammatory processes. Fatigue is one of the most disabling symptoms in MS, with its pathoge­nesis involving grey matter atrophy, and thalamic lesions. Sexual dysfunction affects more than half of patients and may arise from neurological (primary), somatic (secondary), or psychosocial (tertiary) factors. This review aims to summarize current data on hidden manifestations of MS, their pathogenic mechanisms and clinical significance, as well as to highlight new diagnostic trends. The literature search was performed using Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases with the keywords “multiple sclerosis”, “cognitive impairment”, “depression”, “anxiety”, “fatigue”, and “sexual dysfunction.” Additional references were identified through manual bibliography screening.",

The clinical manifestations of diabetic neuropathy vary, ranging from predominantly sensory symptoms sometimes with associated neuropathic pain in diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy to asymmetrical or multifocal weakness, pain, and sensory loss in diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathy. There are different ways of classifying diabetic neuropathy. One way is dividing diabetic neuropathy into two major categories: symmetric and asymmetric neuropathies [2] (Table 1). Asymmetric diabetic neuropathies consist of three major types: diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathies, diabetic mononeuropathies, and diabetic cranial neuropathies [2]. Even though asymmetric diabetic neuropathies are less common than symmetric diabetic neuropathies, they are still important to correctly diagnose as they have different underlying pathophysiology, may be misdiagnosed as the other forms of neuropathies with similar clinical manifestations and perhaps most importantly may respond to immunotherapy or other therapeutic interventions. This chapter describes the asymmetric diabetic neuropathies in details.",

However, the subject is poorly covered in medical education. A major consequence is that the manifestations of the many sleep disorders now identified are likely to be misinterpreted as other clinical conditions of a physical or psychological nature, especially neurological or psychiatric disorders. To illustrate this problem, examples are provided of the various possible causes of sleep loss, poor quality sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of disturbed behaviour at night (parasomnias). All of these sleep disorders can adversely affect mental state and behaviour, daytime performance or physical health, the true cause of which needs to be recognised by clinicians to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. As conventional history taking in neurology and psychiatry pays little attention to sleep and its possible disorders, suggestions are made concerning the enquiries that could be included in history taking schedules to increase the likelihood that sleep disorders will be correctly identified.",

      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited. Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.",

Dementia due to vascular diseases is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and 28 to 36 million people worldwide with dementia are undiagnosed1. Vascular Dementia is characterized by distinct aspects of impaired consciousness and such an impairment is indexed by declined performances at controlled cognitive tasks. It is related to reduced brain metabolic activity in a network of frontal, posterior associative, and limbic regions due to the occurrence of multiple mini/major strokes or other conditions that affect blood vessels and nerve fibres deep inside the brain. Diagnosis of Vascular dementia in its preliminary stages is a very complex task as it requires screening, Neuro-cognitive testing, and brain imaging evidence usually CT Scan or MRI. Sometimes cause of mild impairment cannot be diagnosed by brain Imaging. EEG based diagnostic approaches are promising tool in case of differentiating diverse types of dementia. Portable EEG with its high temporal resolution property is an economical solution for the many undiagnosed people with dementia in the low and middle income countries. This paper reviews EEG analysis approaches to diagnose vascular mild impairment and dementia as a future diagnostic tool in the healthcare sector.",

      "title": "Geriatric Depression: Diagnosis and Treatment",
      "abstract": "GENERATIONS A common but underdiagnosed condition. Clinically significant depression in later life is common, yet it is often underdiagnosed in primary care settings, acute medical and surgical facilities, and long-term care facilities. The pathways to depression in later life include chronic medical and neurologic illnesses and their associated disability, psychosocial stressors (such as bereavement, caregiving, retirement, or interpersonal disputes), cerebrovascular disease and associated risk factors (high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, increased serum lipids), and perhaps some genetic liability. The consequences of depression in old age include suicide, especially in white men ages 75 and older; alcohol dependence; cognitive impairment; amplification of disability associated with medical illness; increased rates of healthcare utilization; and increased rates of mortality following heart attack, stroke, and cancer (for review, see Reynolds et al., 2001). DIAGNOSING DEPRESSION IN OLD AGE The hallmarks of depression in old age are its coexistence with medical illness and its association with cognitive impairment. And it is these very factors that can lead clinicians, patients, and caregivers to overlook or fail to diagnose depression. The most important symptoms in diagnosing depression in an older patient include sad, downcast moods; fiequent tearfulness; and recurrent thoughts of death and suicide. Other important symptoms include diminished interest in pleasurable activities and hobbies, feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness, a sense that life is empty, feelings of guilt, avoidance of social interactions, feelings of helplessness, psychomotor agitation (restlessness, fidgeting) or retardation, difficulty making decisions, and difficulty initiating new projects. Clinicians should also pay attention to reports of family history of mood disorder, appetite change or weight loss, feeling worse in the morning, fatigue or loss of energy, insomnia or hypersomnia, fear that something bad is going to happen, difficulties with memory or concentration, and preoccupation with poor health or physical limitations. As we have recently reviewed (Harman et al., in press), the 1999 Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health decries the fact that depression remains underdiagnosed (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1999), especially among elders. This underdiagnosis may reflect the primary care provider's lack of confidence in diagnosing depression (Unutzer et al.,1999) and the tendency for older adults to use somatic complaints to describe what are actually symptoms of depression (Gallo, Rabins, and Anthony, 1999). In addition, although African American patients have a lower reported prevalence and incidence rate of depression (Kessler et al., 1994), these findings may actually be the result of providers recording depression diagnoses less often among elderly African American patients because of cultural stereotypes (Cooper-- Patrick et al., 1999). The causes of racial differences in diagnosis rates merits further study (Harman et al., in press). Given the many demands for a physician's attention and time, depression often gets less attention during primary-care visits when the patient has several medical problems (Rost et al., 2000). Finally, many clinicians have received inadequate training in interviewing psychiatric patients, a factor that comes into play especially when clinicians suspect that patients may not accept a diagnosis of depression. TREATING DEPRESSION IN OLD AGE We recently conducted a survey of fifty academic geriatric psychiatrists nationwide to develop expert consensus guidelines for the management of depression in old age (Alexopoulos et al., 2001). For more severe depression, most experts recommend combining an antidepressant medication with psychotherapy. Electroconvulsive therapy is an alternative, especially in psychotic depression. …",

      "title": "Differing roles for parvalbumin neurons after nerve injury",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is abnormal, persistent pain that is caused by injury to the somatosensory system. It commonly involves damage to the peripheral nerves as a result of physical trauma, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, infections such as HIV or shingles, or toxicity induced neuropathies as a result of cancer treatments. Neuropathic pain is common, with epidemiological studies suggesting that around 18–30% of American, European and Australian adults suffer from chronic pain. This leads to significant disabilities and suffering. People with chronic pain complain of spontaneous pains that may be electric-shock like or continuous. Often coexisting with these are abnormal, evoked sensations such as tactile allodynia (pain in response to innocuous stimuli e.g., light brush or pressure) and cold allodynia (pain in response to innocuous cooling), or hyperalgesia (increase pain in response to an already noxious stimulus), as well as ataxia and proprioceptive deficits. The management of these conditions is often suboptimal for two main reasons: firstly, an incomplete knowledge of the mechanisms that are involved (and which of them are the most important). Secondly, patients often have compliance issues with pharmacological medications (Attal, 2012). Both peripheral and central neuronal mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology and since the turn of the century particular emphasis has focussed on the role of glial cells in pain (West et al., 2015). Primary sensory afferents convey information about peripheral stimuli to the central nervous system (CNS). Their cell bodies are located in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and constitute a heterogeneous population that has been classified in several ways. Initially, they were split into the small dark and large light groups based on neurofilament (and myelination) content that correlated well with conduction velocities. With the advent of immunohistochemistry, and the discovery of different trophic factors, these groups were further subdivided into peptide-rich and peptide-poor nociceptors, low threshold mechanoreceptor and proprioceptor subgroups (Scott, 1992). Moreover, it is now known that different DRG neurons can express in > 30 different neurotransmitters or receptors associated with a wide variety of stimuli and that they show considerable phenotypic plasticity associated with peripheral injury (Fukuoka and Noguchi, 2002; West et al., 2015). Most of the attention has focussed on the changes associated with small DRG cells that primarily innervate skin, since these are presumed to be responsible for evoked pain sensations after injury. However, less attention has been paid to the effects of injury on proprioceptors in general, and muscle afferents in particular. This is, in part, due to the paucity of histological markers associated with such fibres. The most commonly used marker of proprioceptive (muscle) afferents is parvalbumin (PV) (Medici and Shortland, 2015). PV is a calcium binding protein that is found in subsets of sensory neurons, inhibitory interneurons and motoneurons. Studies that have explored the effects of nerve injury on muscle afferents reported no changes in its staining patterns after injury. However, those early studies used nerve injury models where injured and non-injured cell bodies coexist within the same DRG. Therefore, plasticity could occur without changing the absolute number of positive cells (downregulation in injured and upregulation in spared neurons). Now there are neuronal markers, such as activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which can identify damaged afferents and nerve injury models where the injured and non-injured cell bodies are spatially segregated in adjacent spinal ganglia (Shortland et al., 2006). This prompted us to reinvestigate whether or not PV positive cells show phenotypic plasticity (Medici and Shortland, 2015). We first determined that around 25% of L4–5 DRG cells innervating the sciatic nerve express PV. Following axotomy of the sciatic nerve, this number did not significantly change over 1–28 days, confirming earlier studies. Co-expression with the neuronal injury marker ATF3 showed that approximately half the PV cells were axotomised suggesting that both injured and uninjured neurons express PV after sciatic nerve injury. However, around 50–60% of the L4 & L5 DRG neurons contribute axons to the sciatic nerve, so by itself this result did not really answer whether or not phenotypic plasticity was happening, since for switching to occur, one might predict that little or no colocalisation with ATF3 should occur. Therefore, we switched to the spinal nerve ligation model and selectively lesioned the L5 spinal nerve, whilst being careful not to injure the adjacent L4 spinal nerve. In this model, essentially all DRG neurons were injured and expressed ATF3 (Shortland et al., 2006). The percentage of PV staining in the axotomized L5 DRG was unchanged compared to the adjacent L4 DRG, the contralateral L5 DRG and naïve L5 DRG. On the other hand, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) staining, which is an accepted marker of peptidergic nociceptor afferents, including muscle afferents, was completely abolished in the ipsilateral L5 DRG. Thus, these results unequivocally showed that nerve injury did not produce a phenotypic change in PV positive afferents. They also highlighted a clear difference between phenotypic plasticity in proprioceptors versus nociceptors in response to nerve injury. There is now increasing knowledge of the molecular and biochemical repertoire of proprioceptors. Proprioceptors contain several calcium binding proteins such as calcineurin, calretinin and calbindin. They also contain metabolic markers such as carbonic anhydrase and cytochrome oxidase and the enzyme α3Na+/K+ ATPase. Several ion channels are associated with proprioceptors such as Piezo 2, acid sensing ion channel-3 (ASIC3), transient receptor potential V2 (TRPV2), vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (vglut1) and other markers such as the PDZ scaffold protein whirlin. Piezo2, α3Na+/K+ ATPase and whirlin are specific markers for muscle spindles. Following nerve injury, muscle afferents become spontaneously active and can change their neurotransmitter content. They can upregulate galanin, neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but many of the markers do not change e.g., TRPV2, ASIC3, carbonic anhydrase, whilst the response to others such as Piezo 2 or whirlin are unknown. A key player in contributing to chronic pain appears to be the de novo expression of BDNF in muscle afferents (Michael et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2010). Recent evidence also implicates changes in the sodium channel Nav1.7 in proprioceptors as an important contributor to chronic pain (Fukuoka et al., 2015), as this is increased in muscle afferents after nerve injury. Yet the afferents retain their normal levels of PV. PV is important for regulating calcium homeostasis in a neuron. After nerve injury, muscle afferents have a reduced and redistributed presynaptic input onto homonymous motoneurons. Before injury, synapses were on the proximal dendrites, whilst after injury they were fewer in number and located further away from the soma. This explained the observations of weak excitatory post synaptic potentials to motoneurons and disappearance of stretch reflexes (Vincent et al., 2015). PV is found in the cell body and peripheral endings, but not in the central terminals of afferents in the spinal cord (Petitjean et al., 2015), suggesting PV is more important in physiological process such as speed of muscle contraction rather than neurotransmitter release. Nerve injury causes a selective loss of small, but not large-sized, DRG neurons and so PV may have a role in cell survival. Support for this idea comes from studies in motoneuron disease models, where PV is expressed in motoneuron groups that are resistant to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and over-expression studies where PV prevents excitotoxic cell death (Medici and Shortland, 2015). Although PV is not present in the central terminals of afferents in the spinal cord, PV staining is clearly present in the dorsal horn. This is associated with the cell bodies and dendrites of a subset of inhibitory interneurons located in lamina IIi-III. Recent pharmacogenetic and selective ablation studies have shown that these PV neurons play a key gate keeping role in mechanical allodynia associated with nerve injury (Petitjean et al., 2015). These neurons receive input from low threshold cutaneous afferents and in turn provide presynaptic inhibition of A-fibres as well as postsynaptic inhibition to PKCγ excitatory interneurons. Nerve injury induces a 50% loss of synaptic appositions between PV interneurons and PKCγ interneurons resulting in disinhibition of pain circuits, without causing any death of PV neurons. Moreover, selective pharmacological blockade of PKCγ neurons attenuated the injury-induced mechanical allodynia (Petitjean et al., 2015). Two other circuits have also been proposed for regulating nociceptive transmission: one involves the inhibition of somatostatin (SOM)-positive excitatory interneurons by dynorphin (Dyn)-positive inhibitory interneurons. The second involves vesicular glutamate transport 3 (vGlut3)-positive excitatory interneurons which regulate activity in PKCγ or calretinin-positive excitatory interneurons (Gangadharan and Kuner, 2015). Under normal conditions, the vGlut3 interneurons are under powerful inhibitory control but after nerve injury they can drive mechanical allodynia (Arcourt and Lechner, 2015; Gangadharan and Kuner, 2015). Future experiments should determine whether PV interneurons also gate connections with these two neuronal subpopulations. A final layer of complexity is added by the presence of another DRG subpopulation that can cause allodynia after nerve injury. C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (CLTMs) are attributed to conveying sensations of pleasant touch in normal circumstances but produce allodynia after injury (Nagi et al., 2011; Samour et al., 2015). These fibres have a unique molecular repertoire and terminate in lamina IIi of the cord onto central, stalked and vertical cells (Arcourt and Lechner, 2015). Since PV cells have these morphologies (Hughes et al., 2012) they are ideally placed to receive input from such afferents, although this speculation requires confirmation. Taken together, the results of our and other studies suggest that PV is an important protein related to sensory pathways and the plasticity that occurs after injury (Figure 1). We demonstrated that in primary afferents, PV did not change and so can still be used as an anatomical marker of proprioceptors to explore changes in other transmitters, ion channels or transcription factors after peripheral nerve injury. In the CNS, PV may confer preferential survival to excitotoxic insults and importantly gates abnormal sensory information after injury.Figure 1: Overview of the different roles of PV neurons in pain circuits of the spinal cord.PV identifies sensory proprioceptive afferents that make monosynaptic connections with lower motoneurons (MN). After injury, PV levels in DRG neurons remains unchanged but there is a loss of presynaptic terminals from MNs resulting in reduced motor function. In the spinal cord, PV identifies a subset of inhibitory dorsal horn interneurons that gate information from Aβ afferents by presynaptically inhibiting A-fibres and postsynaptically inhibiting PKCγ excitatory interneurons. Additionally, Aβ afferents contact other inhibitory (e.g., Dyn and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)) and excitatory (e.g., SOM) interneurons forming a circuit that regulates nociceptive transmission. Nerve injury alters the synaptic efficacy and results in decreased activation of inhibitory PV cells and increased activation of excitatory neurons (e.g., vGlut3, PKCγ and SOM) and so results in changes in the neuronal circuitry such that innocuous stimuli can now produce behavioural hypersensitivities such as mechanical and cold allodynia.

      "title": "Cognitive functions and social cognition in multiple sclerosis: An overview.",
      "abstract": "Cognitive decline has been widely reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) despite its clinical heterogeneity, at all stages and in all subtypes of the disease. Deficits are most commonly present in attention, processing speed, working memory, verbal fluency and executive function. However, MS patients also show decreased performance in tasks related to social cognition, i.e. mental operations thatdrive interpersonal skills such as social perception, empathy and theory of mind. Social cognitive deficits are an underestimated but important aspect of impairment in MS, reflecting how people process, store, and apply information in social interactions. Deficits in these domains have been associated with reduced social and psychological quality of life, even after controlling for severity and duration of the disease, age, and neurocognitive performance. Social cognition impairment is not entirely dependent on and parallel to general cognitive dysfunction, given that some patients experience disorganization of their social life before a significant or detectable cognitive impairment. The decrease in performance of social cognition tasks may reflect changes in brain activity and brain structure, either general or regional. Both subtle diffuse pathology and acute local lesions have at least partially independent effects on aspects of social cognition. The observed white matter damage contributes to a mechanism of disruption in the network of brain connections involved in social cognition. Undoubtedly, there is a wide variability in the relationship of social cognitionand neuroanatomical findings, not only due to the brain's complex connectivity, but also to the lack of a unique operative definition of these cognitive domains. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare study results, given the variability of clinical presentations in all stages of the disease.More research would contribute in understanding social cognition deficits better and in determining whether and what kind of training could be beneficial.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

      "title": "Estudio de los síntomas somáticos asociados a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una población de atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

The majority of sleep-related movement disorders is represented by benign conditions which have no known adverse effects on health. Many of these disorders include muscular jerking of the torso or legs. Some disorders consist of repetitive movement of the legs. The severity of each of these disorders varies greatly and, in severe forms, the sleep-related movement disorders can result in sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness. Importantly, similar movements can arise from disease of muscle, nerve, spinal cord or even brain, so if movement is frequent or severe, it is best to consult a health care professional.",

One usually does not consider neuromuscular disorders to have significant symptoms of psychological dysfunction, but, in the diseases that are discussed, psychiatric manifestations can be of great importance to both the patient and practitioner. The literature is in this area is sparse, with the exception of ALS and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. The psychological manifestations of neuromuscular disorders can occur either as a direct result of the disease, for example, pseudobulbar manifestations in ALS, cognitive impairment in myotonic dystrophy, or as a secondary reaction to the illness such as depression in ALS or anxiety in MG. In this chapter, we review the major categories of neuromuscular diseases and those disorders in which the practitioner should be aware of neuropsychological factors both primary and secondary.",

      "abstract": "this is a matter of isolated damage such as amnesia syndrome or if this is a case of diffuse damages that are characteristic of dementia.It is also important to differentiate confusing state from dementia.Confusing state is characterized by acute or sub-acute beginning, fluctuating course with consciousness disturbance, attention deficit, increased psychomotorics, common reversibility lasting for several days or weeks, whereas dementia has a slow start, progressive course without disturbance of consciousness and without distraction lasting a few months or years accompanied by irreversibility.Dementias are acquired, generalized and most frequently progressive disorders of cognitive functions that include intelligence, learning and memory, speech, problem solving, orientation, perception, attention, concentration, judgement and social abilities.Strong personality damages can also occur.They are diagnosed if impairment of cognitive functions disturbs work and social functioning of a person and shows a deterioration from the previous level of functioning.In diagnostics along with common neurological testing it is crucial to test cognitive status involving examination of memory, attention, speech functions, sensory and motor functions as well as integrative functions.Clinically, dementias are manifested by changes in cognition, fatigue, difficulties in planning and performing tasks, personality changes, behavioural changes.Demented patients are prone to detailed and extensive retelling, anger, sarcasm, pathetic expression of the face, aggression and emotional instability.The disease ultimately causes complete disability and such persons require adequate care.Dementia is not exclusively related to the geriatric age, but it may also occur earlier with diseases that alter brain function.Causes of dementia may be different.The so-called \"memo-VITAMINS test\" is applied and it indicates possible causes of dementia; these are vascular, infectious, toxic-metabolic, autoimmune, metastatic, androgenic, neurodegenerative and systemic causes.The most frequent is Alzheimer's dementia followed by a large group of dementias associated with parkinsonism involving dementia related to Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewis relapses.[3] Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system; it is the most common type of dementia occurring in 5% of patients over the age of 50 and in 50% of patients over 80 years of age.It is also the most common cause of dementia in persons older than 65 years.The first and dominant disease symptom is a memory disorder along with disorders of speech function, praxies, gnostics and executive functions.The consequence is emergence of disturbances in three key areas of life: in daily life activities, behaviour and personality as well as cognitive functions. 1,2",

Među najcescim smetnjama kod rada na racunalima jesu smetnje vida. Istraživanja su pokazala da se smetnje manifestiraju u obliku naprezanja i umora ociju, ocni kapci se tesko otvaraju i zatvaraju, iritacija, suhoca i pecenje konjunktiva, subjektivni osjecaj “pijeska” u ocima, bol ociju, praceni glavoboljom, mucninom (astenopija), te raznim psihickim i psiholoskim reakcijama. Napor ociju vezan je i uz razne subjektivne faktore kao sto su opci umor, upotreba lijekova, bolest, sklonost migreni, osjetljivost na svjetlo te nervoza i nemir. Svi ti faktori mogu pojacati simptome vidnog napora, no glavni uzroci vidnog napora su bljestanje, kontrastno bljestanje, titranje i svjetlucanje slike na ekranu, reflektiranja te okolnih radnih uvjeta. Prema provedenim ispitivanjima (Kalifornijsko sveuciliste, L.A.) 50% osoba koje rade na racunalu najmanje 4 sata na dan ima problema s ocima.

En otras ocasiones, estas alteraciones pueden ser secundarias a las características de la patología, como tipo y frecuencia de crisis; a los efectos adversos a los fármacos antiepilépticos; a los trastornos neuropsiquiátricos comúnmente asociados con esta patología, y/o a las alteraciones psico-sociales y académicas asociadas.

Cognitive, behavioral and emotional disturbances are the rule rather than the exception in patients with epilepsy. These abnormalities may even precede the seizures themselves and though this might be a reflection of the dysfunction of a specific brain region or, in some cases, a diffuse brain disorder that is global, which manifests itself later as epilepsy. These alterations may reflect the adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs or neuropsychiatric disorders commonly associated with this condition, such as mood or anxiety disorders, among others. Neuropsychologists participate in the evaluation of the cognitive and behavioral manifestations in these patients in order to assist in the diagnosis and in integrated management with the aim of improving their quality of life.",

Häufig wird in den Lehrbüchern hier lapidar auf neurotoxische Schäden des Alkoholismus oder Mangelzustände verwiesen. In Teilbereichen ist die Forschung aber heute schon weiter. Im Vortrag wird ein kurzer Überblick über die wichtigsten neuropsychiatrischen Folgeschäden bei Alkoholismus gegeben und einige aktuelle Befunde zu Pathophysiologie und Therapie mitgeteilt. Eines der thematisierten Krankheitsbilder betrifft dabei die Alkoholhalluzinose, eine eher seltene Störung, bei denen der Alkoholkranke an akustischen Halluzinationen, gelegentlich auch paranoiden Symptomen oder Bewusstseins- und Orientierungsstörungen leidet. Trotz phänomenologischer Ähnlichkeit besteht offensichtlich keine genetische Verbindung zur Schizophrenie. Kasuistische Beobachtungen aus der Bildgebung haben gezeigt, dass bei Patienten mit Alkoholhalluzinose häufig eine Hypofunktion des Thalamus vorliegt, ähnlich wie bei schizophrenen Erkrankungen. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt des Vortrages wird das Wernicke-Korsakow-Syndrom sein, für das bislang keine ausreichenden Therapiemöglichkeiten bestehen.",

She was referred for neuropsychological assessment to evaluate memory loss for her past and her identity. The Test of Memory Malingering and the Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology suggested feigned memory deficits. The hospital eventually learned Jane Doe’s identity. She was wanted for a crime in another state, but also had a psychiatric history with several hospitalizations. When confronted, she admitted her deception. This case illustrates the importance of using formal testing and consulting the scientific literature on memory for discerning true versus feigned memory deficits.

On the other hand, epilepsy can be the cause of an additional disorder or the consequence of another health problem. Sometimes, epileptic seizures are the first sign of another condition or disease. This chapter will first focus on health problems that can be caused by epilepsy. The second part of the chapter describes other disorders or conditions that can cause epileptic seizures and epilepsy. When a medical disorder causes epileptic seizures, doctors do not always make a diagnosis of epilepsy. If people have seizures that were clearly provoked by another disorder (for instance, a low sodium level caused by diuretic medication—water tablets), treatment should involve the removal of the underlying cause of the seizures and not antiepileptic drugs. However, other medical conditions associated with epilepsy may not always be cured as easily, and people’s quality of life may then be affected by two chronic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa dramatically demonstrates the inseparability of mind and body and is a classic example of a psychosomatic disorder. It is primarily a psychic and secondarily a somatic disturbance. Inasmuch as the personality reaction of the individual suffering from anorexia nervosa more nearly conforms to compulsion neurosis than that of any other psychiatric disorder and, in addition, has cachexia rather than anorexia as a leading symptom, it is suggested that the illness would be more accurately termed compulsion neurosis with cachexia. Although definitive data as to etiology are not available, evidence presented indicates that constitutional defect probably predisposes to the illness, which becomes manifest at puberty or shortly thereafter because of severe and deep psychological conflicts centering in the family constellation. The dynamics of these conflicts are discussed and the conclusion drawn that the patient's basic difficulty lies in her more intimate interpersonal relationships. Adequate physiological and psychological treatment, described in detail, offers a reasonably good prognosis, although the tendency to relapse is great.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive psychology has provided clinicians with specific tools for analyzing the processes of cognition (memory, language) and executive functions (attention-concentration, abstract reasoning, planning). Neuropsychology, coupled with the neurosciences (including neuroimaging techniques), has authenticated the existence of early disorders affecting the \"superior or intellectual\" functions of the human brain. The prevalence of cognitive and attention disorders is high in adults because all the diseases implicating the central nervous system are associated with cognitive correlates of variable intensity depending on the disease process and the age of the patient. In some pathologies, cognitive impairment can be a leading symptom such as in schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder or an emblematic stigmata as in dementia including Alzheimer's disease. Paradoxically, public health authorities have only recognized as medications for improving cognitive symptoms those with proven efficacy in the symptomatic treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease; the other cognitive impairments are relegated to the orphanage of syndromes and symptoms dispossessed of medication. The purpose of this review is to promote a true \"pharmacology of cognition\" based on the recent knowledge in neurosciences. Data from adult human beings, mainly concerning memory, language, and attention processes, will be reported. \"Drug therapeutic strategies\" for improving cognition (except for memory function) are currently rather scarce, but promising perspectives for a new neurobiological approach to cognitive pharmacology will be highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that represents the most common form of dementia. The most prominent feature of AD is the decline in cognitive function, with an early impairment of episodic memory. The memory deficit of an AD patient is characterized by the amnestic syndrome of the medial temporal type. As the disease progresses, the condition often manifests in language disorders, visuospatial deficits and executive dysfunctions. Patients often have neuropsychiatric disturbances, as apathy and psychotic symptoms. Loss of autonomy follows cognitive impairment. The clinical diagnosis of AD is based on a complete medical examination with a neuropsychological evaluation. The FCSRT (free and cued selective reminding test) is recommended for the identification of the amnestic syndrome of the medial temporal type, which is defined by: (1) a very poor free recall and (2) a decreased total recall due to an insufficient effect of cueing. The neuropsychological tests should also assess other cognitive functions that may be perturbed in AD, such as executive functions, praxis, visuospatial capacities and language. Neuroimaging and biological exams (genetics, biomarkers) are of great utility in the evaluation. Other medical, neurological, or psychiatric disorders which could account for the impairment in memory and related symptoms must be always investigated.",

      "abstract": "Critically ill patients with a primary neurological injury or illness pose unique challenges for pain, agitation, and delirium management in intensive care units (ICUs). Detection and monitoring can be limited by contextual level of consciousness (LOC) alterations, cognition, expression, or language deficits. Recent data suggest that existing pain assessment tools may not be applicable to all neurocritically ill patients, especially in those with LOC alterations and atypical pain-associated behaviors. Targeted sedation goals may be neurologically disease specific; for instance, intracranial pressure (ICP) targets will supersede sedation titration by other criteria. Technology such as bispectral index (BIS) may be beneficial in avoiding excessive medication administration in deeply sedated neurologically injured ICU patients. Given the wide variety of pathology in the neurocritically ill patients, it is unclear if delirium can be diagnosed and unequivocally differentiated from symptoms of the underlying neurological pathology. However, delirium symptoms may herald life-threatening primary insult progression or result from a new secondary neurological injury and should be monitored. Patients with neurological injury or illness are often excluded from ICU studies addressing pain, sedation, and delirium, but this need not be the case. We review what is understood in this area based on current evidence.",

      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "abstract": "Dementia is a frequent consequence of neurodegenerative diseases involving the cerebral cortex. Unlike stroke, encephalitis or head injury, which lead to relatively circumscribed and stable brain damage, degenerative disorders often affect many regions of the brain. The widespread changes in brain structure and the multiple signs of cognitive impairment that result from such changes have led to a conceptualization of the degenerative dementias, and especially of Alzheimer's disease, as 'diffuse' pathological processes, but this is not strictly true. The degenerative dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, do not affect the entire cerebral cortex equally. Instead, the degenerative dementias are associated with varied profiles of anatomic involvement, which can be tracked by quantitative histopathological and neuroimaging techniques. Association and limbic regions suffer the brunt of the damage.",

      "abstract": "The recovery process after acute brain damage has attracted little interest from either basic or clinical scientists who seem to be most concerned with the acute stage. Much might be learnt about the mechanisms of the nervous system from study of the recovery process. The number of patients with permanent brain damage is growing as the result of the increased survival rate from such common conditions as severe head injury and non-geriatric stroke. Response to this problem has largely come from other disciplines, and in the form of supportive care rather than scientific enquiry. Such an enquiry might seek to answer three outstanding questions. (1) What is the nature of the persisting disability? (2) Can more scientifically based rehabilitation, including physical, mental and social components, either accelerate the rate of recovery or reduce the degree of ultimate disability? (3) Can the ultimate outcome be predicted in the acute stage; and can the amount of further improvement be estimated in the later stages of recovery?",

      "abstract": "Many clinicians treat patients with neurological symptoms such as muscle weakness and involuntary movements, that do not correspond to organic findings. The differential diagnosis of patients with medically unexplainable symptoms includes conversion disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and illness anxiety disorder among others. Conversion disorder is a mental disorder with pseudo-neurological symptoms that are not due to an organic abnormality. For its diagnosis it is necessary to show that the symptoms and findings are not compatible with neurological diseases. Conversion disorder and any neurological diseases can coexist, in which cases neurologists and psychiatrists should cooperate when treating the patient. However, it is difficult to clearly distinguish individual symptoms by their mechanism. Patients complaining of physical symptoms, including those with conversion disorder, require careful explanation that takes into account the patient's explanatory model. Clinicians must switch from an acute disease model to a chronic disease model. These patients are more likely to concentrate consciously on their physical condition and clinicians should help patients avoid ruminating on their physical symptoms. Because it is not simple to completely exclude physical disorders and prove that the symptoms are psychogenic, confirming a diagnosis should be performed carefully.",

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

      "title": "Diagnosis of Dementia Using Nuclear Medicine Imaging Modalities",
      "abstract": "Dementia describes the loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases, and which has the potential to affect memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior.Most types of dementia involve irreversible neurodegeneration, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form.Beyond AD however, there are many other diseases that can lead to dementia including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease with dementia, corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).Dementia can also be the result of many small strokes and, in such cases, is called vascular dementia.Whilst such clinically and neuropathologically overlapping dementia diseases can be predicted by clinical diagnosis, definitively differentiating them from one another has typically been attempted using high-risk diagnostic procedures (e.g.brain biopsy, Lumbar puncture) or, more commonly, during a post-mortem examination.This makes it difficult to a) differentiate dementias and treat each appropriately before patient death; b) manage the diseases early, before the onset of cognitive decline; c) select appropriate patients for assisting in dementia-related drug development; and d) track the impact of new dementia therapeutics in clinical trials.Therefore, new non-invasive diagnostic methods for managing dementia are in high demand and, reflecting this, many radiopharmaceuticals (drugs tagged with a radioactive isotope) have been developed over the last 2 decades that allow noninvasive examination of dementia pathophysiology in living human subjects using nuclear medicine imaging techniques.Such techniques include positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, and have greatly enhanced diagnostic confidence across the entire dementia disease spectrum in recent years.This chapter reviews radiopharmaceuticals commonly employed clinically in the management of dementia patients, suffering from the diseases outlined above, with nuclear medicine modalities.The chapter is divided by disease entity, and progress in imaging the pathophysiology of each disease is highlighted.In addition to those radiopharmaceuticals with approval for human use discussed herein, there are many experimental radiopharmaceuticals for dementia in pre-clinical development, which have not yet been translated into clinical use.Comprehensive review of such pre-clinical radiopharmaceuticals is outside the scope of this book, and pertinent examples are highlighted only when necessary to indicate key concepts involved in imaging dementia patients.The interested reader can obtain additional information on radiopharmaceuticals currently in development www.intechopen.com",

      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms, due either major depression or clinically significant, subsyndromal depression, occur commonly in the course of Alzheimer's disease. For a variety of clinical and methodological reasons, this remains an area that begs for new investigation. At the very least, these depressive symptoms should be viewed as a cause of significant and treatable \"excess disability\" (Kramer and Reifler, 1992). Demented patients with clinically significant depression (e.g., depressed mood, significant loss of appetite, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and agitation) should be considered for a trial of antidepressant therapy, even when they fail to meet full diagnostic criteria for major depression. These symptoms will, in most instances, respond to antidepressant therapy. The \"rules\" for treatment of depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) pay attention to cognitive toxicity of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms do not persist as long as in cognitively intact patients. Current treatments, especially those SSRI's like fluoxetine and sertraline that have cognitive enhancing effects, should be considered the \"first line\" antidepressants. We need to emphasize early detection and treatment of depressive symptoms in dementia in all arenas.",

Frühe Symptome sind Müdigkeit, Apathie, Ungeschicklichkeit sowie Konzentrationsstörungen, die sich bis hin zu einem deliranten Syndrom mit generalisierten Anfällen, Bewusstseinstrübung und Koma fortentwickeln können. Pathophysiologisch liegt der UE wahrscheinlich eine parathormonabhängige Beeinträchtigung synaptischer Funktionen im ZNS zugrunde. Bildgebende Verfahren dienen im Wesentlichen dem Ausschluss anderer neurologischer Erkrankungen, im EEG zeigen sich die unspezifischen Veränderungen einer metabolischen Enzephalopathie. Die Behandlung der UE besteht in einer Normalisierung der metabolischen Entgleisung, die in der Regel zu einer vollständigen Remission der neuropsychiatrischen Symptome führt. Bei effektiver Therapie (gegebenenfalls mit Dialyse) und schneller Restitution der Nierenfunktion sind residuelle neurologische Defizite ungewöhnlich. Bei permanentem Nierenversagen ist die Nierentransplantation Therapie der Wahl. Die urämische Neuropathie (UNP) ist eine distal betonte, axonale, sensible mehr als motorische Neuropathie mit brennenden Dysästhesien. Häufig sind Mononeuropathien, v. a. das Karpaltunnelsyndrom, als Folge einer vermehrten Anfälligkeit für Druckläsionen. Eine Beteiligung des autonomen Nervensystems in bis zu 50 % der Patienten ist beschrieben. Elektrophysiologisch findet sich eine Verlangsamung der Nervenleitgeschwindigkeiten und distalen motorischen Latenzen mit reduzierten Amplituden sowie im Verlauf Denervierungszeichen im Elektromyogramm als Kennzeichen einer vorwiegend axonalen Neuropathie. Die Therapie der UNP besteht in einer effektiven Dialyse. Leichte UNP können sich klinisch durchaus zurückbilden, wobei Veränderungen der neurophysiologischen Parameter in der Regel bestehen bleiben. Schwere UNP bilden sich klinisch trotz adäquater Dialysetherapie allenfalls leicht zurück. Die erfolgreiche Nierentransplantation führt zu einer Verbesserung bei praktisch allen Patienten mit UNP außer bei weit fortgeschrittenen Fällen. Wichtige dialyseassoziierte Komplikationen sind das Dialysedysäquilibriumsyndrom (DDS) und die Dialyseenzephalopathie (DE). Ersteres manifestiert sich mit Unruhe, Muskelkrämpfen, Übelkeit und migräneartigen Kopfschmerzen bedingt durch einen plötzlichen Abfall der Serumosmolalität unter Dialyse mit zytotoxischem Hirnödem. Letztere ist durch Aluminiumtoxizität verursacht und vor allem durch progressive Sprech- und Sprachstörungen, Depression, Myoklonien und Anfälle gekennzeichnet. Präterminal sind die Patienten immobil und mutistisch. Das DDS wird durch eine langsame Dialyse verhindert, die DE durch aluminiumfreie Diät und Dialyse sowie mit Chelatbildnern (Desferrioxamin) behandelt. Bis zu 70 % aller DE-Patienten verbessern sich darunter.",

Complications are usually associated with the research approach, the etiological coherence of co-occurrence, and the obscurity or absence of diagnostic criteria for mental disorders due to a general medical condition or drugs, age, etc. This review aims to investigate contemporary epidemiological data on mental and somatic comorbidity.The frequent co-occurrence of certain physical diseases and certain mental disorders is corroborated by contemporary epidemiological data. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, respiratory disorders, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders seem to be associated with mental disorders; the rates of occurrence, however, depend on the special characteristics of the sample. Utilization of healthcare systems and costs for patients with mental-somatic comorbidities are suggested to be higher than those for patients without comorbidities.Although it is generally accepted that many physical conditions have been associated with serious mental disorders, the exact nature of the relationship between them is still unclear. Various factors such as unhealthy lifestyle habits, psychotropic medication, and inadequate medical treatment or provision are implicated. Further research is required.",

In the meantime a high proportion of elderly people very often experience limitations in daily life due to impairments in memory and other cognitive functions. Non-cognitive neuropsychiatric disorders, most commonly stress-related anxiety disorders, are a major contribution to maladaptation in these patients. The present studies of the neurobiology of aging enable one to decipher not only the mechanisms that underlie the physiology of brain aging, but also the factors that influence cognitive aging and aggravate the manifestations of cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative disease. The process of brain aging is known to presume the long-term preservation of functional neuroplasticity that is greatly influenced by different lifestyle factors, such as daily social and physical activities, the pattern and amount of food taken, cognitive activity, and stressful life events. These lifestyle factors are supposedly a potent tool to maintain physiological brain aging and a delayed cognitive diminution in elderly people. At the same time, studies of the possibility of pharmacologically correcting age-related (both cognitive and non-cognitive) impairments are promising to improve everyday function in elderly people.",

Neuropatológiai szempontból meghatározó a kóros α-szinuklein-aggregátumokat tartalmazó Lewy-testek (LB) jelenléte. DLB-ben nagyszámú LB található a corticalis régiókban, míg PDD-ben elsősorban a subcorticalis területek érintettek. Továbbá, DLB-ben gyakoribb az Alzheimer-kórra (AD) jellegzetes β-amyloid-plakkok és neurofibrillaris kötegek megjelenése. A mai napig vitatott, hogy valóban két külön betegségről vagy egyazon kórkép különböző megnyilvánulásairól van-e szó. A klinikai diagnózis alapja a motoros és a kognitív tünetek megjelenése között eltelt idő: DLB-ben a demencia gyakran a parkinsonizmus előtt jelentkezik, míg PDD-ben a motoros tünetek alakulnak ki korábban. Az egyre pontosabb képalkotó módszerek alapján DLB-ben nagyobb mértékű a corticalis károsodás, a kolinerg deficit, valamint a társuló AD-patológia, mint PDD-ben. Terápiás szempontból a PDD-ben gyakran használt levodopa DLB-ben kevésbé hatékony, sőt növelheti a pszichózis kialakulásának kockázatát, a betegség magtüneteihez tartozó hallucinációk és viselkedési tünetek kezelése pedig a jelentős antipszichotikum-hiperszenzitivitás miatt ütközik nehézségekbe.

The most frequently reported pattern is the one in which patients have a selective or disproportionate impairment in processing the concepts of living things, but the reverse pattern, with the nonliving concepts being more impaired, has also been reported. The existence of such patterns of dissociation suggests that the conceptual system is organized on a categorical basis. However, according to the most widely accepted account for category-specific semantic deficits, these patterns in fact emerge as an accidental consequence of another organizing principle of semantic knowledge, namely, the kind of properties (sensorial or functional) being represented. This sensori-functional account of category-specific semantic deficits presented itself as superior to a categorical account on the basis of the following points: (1) the patterns of dissociation between impaired versus spared categories do not follow the living versus nonliving distinction; (2) these patterns can be accounted for by reference to the kind of properties (visual versus functional) that are relevant for a given class of concepts; (3) the patients with a selective deficit for living things also present with a selective deficit in processing the visual properties of concepts. Here we show that none of these points stand up to analysis of the empirical facts, which in addition are more consistent with the hypothesis of a categorical organization of the conceptual system.",

      "abstract": "Een hoog niveau van neuroticisme is een belangrijke risico factor voor zowel psychische als lichamelijke problemen. Bovendien is neuroticisme niet alleen geassocieerd met problemen op het gebied van persoonlijk welbevinden maar ook met substantiele kosten voor de maatschappij. Het is daarom belangrijk om zowel de oorzaken als de gevolgen van neuroticisme beter te begrijpen. Gedrags-genetische studies suggereren dat ongeveer de helft van de verschillen tussen mensen in neuroticisme veroorzaakt wordt door omgevingsinvloeden. In dit proefschrift heb ik onderzocht welke levensgebeurtenissen voorafgaan aan veranderingen in neuroticisme, en hoe lang zulke veranderingen aanhouden. Hiertoe heb ik een aantal longitudinale studies uitgevoerd en de literatuur betreffende veranderingen in neuroticisme in volwassenen samengevat. De resultaten laten zien dat stressvolle levensgebeurtenissen (in het bijzonder sociale stress en conflict), die gekarakteriseerd kunnen worden als onvoorspelbaar, oncontroleerbaar, onverwacht, onwenselijk, of niet passend bij de normale levensloop, vaak worden gevolgd door een langdurige toename in neuroticisme. Echter, positieve levensveranderingen kunnen ook leiden tot een afname van neuroticisme. Daarnaast heb ik de betekenis onderzocht van de relatie tussen neuroticisme en veelvoorkomende psychische problemen, zoals angst, depressie, en middelenmisbruik. De resultaten laten zien dat neuroticisme een belangrijke voorspeller is voor de ontwikkeling van veelvoorkomende psychische problemen, en tot op zekere hoogte gezien kan worden als een maat voor meer milde problemen. De conclusie van dit proefschrift is dat het neuroticisme niveau van mensen mede afhankelijk is van zijn of haar omgeving, gevoelig is voor positieve en negatieve levensgebeurtenissen, consequenties heeft voor psychische gezondheid, en veranderlijker is dan lang werd gedacht.",

This illness is seen in an individual who has no history of any preexisting psychiatric illness except for uncomplicated episodes of depression or mania. Clinically there are two types of primary affective disorder. The first is manic depressive disease (bipolar psychosis) which may be considered as a primary affective disorder in which mania is seen; usually, but not always, depression is also seen in this kind of patient. The other type may be called depressive disease; a synonym that might be used is unipolar psychosis; here only depressive episodes are seen (one or more episodes). In addition to the difference in the clinical picture, considerable genetic data exist which indicate that the two illnesses are quite distinct from each other.",

The repeated measurement of sleep latency across a day provides direct access to the diurnal fraction of the sleep/wake interaction, which is of fundamental concern to the sleep specialist. Objective laboratory documentation of the clinical symptoms of slepiness well as abnormal sleep structure has greatly facilitated the diagnosis of narcolepsy, in particular, and has also been useful to determine the severity of somnolence and therapeutic response in other disorders. At the current level of clinical experience, a diagnosis of narcolepsy or other disorders of excessive somnolence usually has lifelong consequences for the patients, for example, chronic chemotherapy with psychoactive compounds, legal proscription from driving, or surgery. It therefore is incumbent upon the clinical sleep specialist to achieve as much diagnostic precision as possible. The MSLT greatly enhances the accurate diagnosis of disorders of excessive somnolence.",

Most of these patients recover full function within about 3 months, but a significant minority do not. Failure to recover as expected following a diagnosed or suspected mild TBI is most commonly related to a concurrent diagnosis or alternative diagnosis or condition. Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms. Accurate diagnosis will lead to better treatment and optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on early identification of the 'slow to recover' group to allow early and appropriate treatment.",

Die am besten untersuchte Alternative zu Neuroleptika ist die Behandlung sowohl der kognitiven wie psychotischen Symptome der DLK mit Cholinesterasehemmern, die als anerkannter Standard gelten. Wenn Cholinesterasehemmer aber kontraindiziert sind, nicht vertragen werden oder nicht ausreichend wirken, stellt sich die Frage nach anderen Behandlungsmöglichkeiten. Clozapin, langsam eindosiert und in niedrigen Dosen, ist ebenso wie bei Psychosen im Verlauf eines M. Parkinson auch in dieser Indikation bei der DLK wirksam, erfordert aber besondere Vorsichtsmaßnahmen. Da DLK-Patienten Antiparkinsonika häufig schlechter vertragen, sollte deren Einsatz auf L-Dopa beschränkt sein und mit Zurückhaltung erfolgen.

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

      "title": "Roentgenologic Diagnosis",
      "abstract": "As in medicine in general, so it is with roentgenology; in some cases, medical diagnosis is very easy, and in other cases it is difficult, or quite impossible. Some cases are just naturally obscure, uncertain and troublesome; it is in these that roentgenographic diagnosis is difficult of application. That is owing either to the fact that the symptoms of the disease are only slightly developed, or that the real disease takes on the symptoms of some other disease, the real disease being masked or concealed by a simulated affection. In atypical cases and in rare diseases, great difficulties lie naturally in the way of an accurate diagnosis. In addition, it must be said that the so-called rare diseases are, for the most part, in reality not so rare as is commonly supposed. The success of a roentgenologic diagnosis in the aforementioned difficult cases depends on the co-existence of three distinct groups of pre-conditions: 1. A good knowledge of medicine—not only of general medicine (general anatomy, physiology, pathologic anatomy, pathology) but also special medical knowledge of the group of diseases that interest us from the practical standpoint. The roentgenologist should be familiar not only with the typical forms of the ordinary diseases but also the atypical forms; furthermore, with the rare diseases. If one knows little or nothing of a rare disease—possibly not even the name —one is, of course, absolutely unable to recognize a case if it should arise. 2. During the course of my practice, it has happened not infrequently that I have given false interpretations of roentgenograms. I have often assumed the presence of an ordinary disease, whereas it developed later that a rare and little known affection obtained. There have likewise been many cases in which I recognized at once from the findings that I should be unable to reach any definite diagnosis, and that therefore I should refrain from risking an opinion. That has occurred with reference to manifold diseases and to diverse regions of the body. 3. A good knowledge of roentgenology as applicable to medicine—not only general knowledge but also knowledge of the special field in question. I mean, more particularly, a knowledge of the manner in which diseases present themselves at the roentgenographic examination, as based on various considerations and on our observations and experiences. Here, too, great difficulties arise, especially by reason of the fact that at the roentgenographic examination the organs are presented only to a limited extent as shadow pictures of significant density.",

      "title": "Psychotic Disorders",
      "abstract": "The term “psychotic disorders” refers to a broad conceptualization of conditions including primary psychoses, such as schizophrenia and psychotic mood disorders, other disorders that are sometimes marked by psychotic features (e.g., borderline personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder), and secondary psychotic disorders due to medical conditions or substances (e.g., alcohol withdrawal delirium). As addressed in Ketter, et al. 2004 (“Psychotic Bipolar Disorders: Dimensionally Similar to or Categorically Different from Schizophrenia?,” cited in the Debate of Dimensional versus Categorical), controversy regarding relationships among mood disorders (particularly bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features) and schizophrenia is ongoing. The authors argue that while the respective dimensional (e.g., psychotic bipolar disorder as intermediate between non-psychotic bipolar and schizophrenia spectrum disorders) versus categorical debate persists, a mixed dimensional/categorical approach may best help elucidate pathophysiology and treatment options. Schizophrenia, specifically, is a severe and persistent form of mental illness often marked by positive symptoms (such as excesses and distortions in thoughts and sensory/perceptual experiences such as hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (behavioral deficits such as avolition, asociality, anhedonia, blunted affect, and alogia), disorganized symptoms (such as disorganized speech and behavior), movement symptoms (or grossly abnormal psychomotor behavior such as catatonia), and impairments in cognition (such as memory and frontal/executive functions that include, for example, planning ability and initiation). Kring, et al. 2014 (Abnormal Psychology, cited under the Schizophrenia Spectrum) provides an excellent introductory-level overview of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The etiological (or causal) basis of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders remains not wholly determined. Prevailing theories, however, ascribe to a diathesis-stress model, whereby biological factors (e.g., predispositions such as genetic liability) are believed to interact with adverse environmental factors (e.g., obstetric complications; adverse, stressful life events) over the course of development toward the manifestation of illness. This article offers a historical perspective of psychotic disorders, a review of etiological/theoretical models, a description of illness epidemiology and issues pertaining to sex differences and comorbidity, an outline of diagnostic considerations, a description of the schizophrenia spectrum, an examination of available assessment tools, the role of cognition/social cognition, a review of current evidence of neurobiological disruptions in psychosis (e.g., genetics, structural and functional neuroimaging, hormones, neurotransmitters, other aspects of maldevelopment in the central nervous system), other laboratory markers (e.g., perceptual and attentional abnormalities, smooth-pursuit eye movement dysfunction), environmental factors (such as stress, toxins, and familial-expressed emotion), the importance of gene-environment interactions in psychotic disorders, and, finally, current directions pertaining to prevention and treatment (pharmacological and psychosocial). While various psychotic-related disorders are addressed, this article focuses on the schizophrenia spectrum.",

      "abstract": "La discapacidad intelectual (DI) o trastorno del desarrollo intelectual (TDI) es uno de los principales trastornos del neurodesarrollo y afecta al 2% de la poblacion, es decir, a mas de un millon de personas en Francia. Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica. La evaluacion periodica y multidimensional de las competencias cognitivas, escolares, socioemocionales y adaptativas a lo largo de la vida permite comprender mejor el funcionamiento de las personas con una DI y prever estrategias adecuadas de aprendizaje, tratamiento, acompanamiento y apoyo para una mejor calidad de vida y participacion en la vida de la sociedad.",

We report a case of acute-onset psychosis in a woman that led to a diagnosis of SLE, which was substantiated by physical evaluation and laboratory assessments.

      "abstract": "Syndrome of dementia, which appears as a result of deterioration of brain structure that is caused by different factors, together with syndrome of psychomotor restlessness, represents one of the most common psychiatric conditions at patients of the geriatric population (older than 75 years). Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionNeuropsychiatric disorders represent a serious medical and human issue.In general, these diseases are detrimental to the quality of life and sociability of afflicted patients.Moreover, they are an immense socio-economic burden.Brain disorders are sometimes denoted as ´graveyards of pharmaceutical enterprises´, referring to relatively a large proportion of drugs for these diseases failing to prove efficient or safe in later phases of clinical trials.Our understanding of what really happens in the central nervous system (CNS) is very limited, especially in relation to normal and pathological behaviors.This limitation also effects the research of neuropsychiatric disorders.We do not know the exact pathogenic mechanisms of numerous diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia, which prevents the causal treatment of many of them.The symptomatic-like treatment often yields an insufficient therapeutic outcome and in many cases, is accompanied by serious side-effects (as is the case for classical antipsychotics in refractory schizophrenic patients).In some areas of neuro-science research, we are often just beginning to understand brain-behavior relationships in health and disease.Aside from being a serious socio-economic and human challenge, many neuropsychiatric disorders involve deficits in mental and behavioral functions.These often reflect disrupted processing of information in the brain (such as gating deficits; more later), storage of information (learning and memory deficits, extending from working memory to long-term retention) and higher cognitive domains (such as impaired executive functions, cognitive control deficits).The diseased brain seems to process at least some information incorrectly, which contributes to the manifestation of the disease and may seriously alter behavior and the normal functioning of afflicted patients.Therefore, beside basic studies aimed at the nature of information processing and cognition impairments in human CNS diseases, important usage of behavioral tests lies in both screening for putative cognition-improving drugs and cognitive side-effects of established and novel pharmaceuticals.Behavioral researchers in pre-clinical research conventionally use tests of information processing and sensorimotor gating, often tested with prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex (e.g.Bubenikova-Valesova et al., 2007), spontaneous behaviors (e.g.Palenicek et al., www.intechopen.com",

      "abstract": "Recognizing depression in brain-damaged patients poses considerable problems. The standard diagnostic criteria often are not applicable since the neurological lesion may distort or even obliterate salient features of depression. Patients actually may deny being depressed or dysphoric, not have a depressive affect, or be totally unaware of abnormal vegetative behaviors. Furthermore, brain lesions themselves may produce striking behavioral alterations that can be mistakenly attributed to depression, or striking behavioral changes due to depression may be mistakenly attributed to the brain lesion. Based on five case studies, several clinical guidelines for recognizing and diagnosing depression in brain-damaged patients are offered. These cases also provide a data base to generate initial hypotheses about the neuroanatomical basis of the depressive syndrome. By observing how focal brain lesions modify the signs and symptoms of depression, inferences are made about brain areas crucial for modulating the various features of the depressive syndrome.",

      "abstract": "La enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es un trastorno neurológico progresivo conocido por una gran cantidad de características motoras y no motoras que pueden afectar la función en un grado variable. Esta revisión describe las características clínicas de la EP con énfasis en aquellas que diferencian la enfermedad de otros trastornos parkinsonianos. Debido a que no existe una prueba definitiva para el diagnóstico de la EP, la enfermedad debe diagnosticarse con base en criterios clínicos. El temblor en reposo, la bradicinesia, la rigidez y la pérdida de los reflejos posturales se consideran generalmente los signos cardinales de la EP. La presencia y la presentación específica de estas características se utilizan para diferenciar la EP de los trastornos parkinsonianos relacionados. Otras características clínicas incluyen síntomas motores secundarios (por ejemplo: Hipomimia, disartria, disfagia, sialorrea, micrografía, marcha arrastrando los pies, festinación, congelación, distonía, reflejos glabelares), síntomas no motores (por ejemplo: Disfunción autonómica, anomalías cognitivas / neuroconductuales, trastornos del sueño y anomalías sensoriales como anosmia, parestesias y dolor). La ausencia de temblor en reposo, la aparición temprana de dificultad para caminar, la inestabilidad postural, la demencia, las alucinaciones y la presencia de disautonomía, oftalmoparesia, ataxia y otras características atípicas, junto con una respuesta deficiente o nula a la levodopa, sugieren diagnósticos distintos de la EP. Un conocimiento profundo del amplio espectro de manifestaciones clínicas de la EP es fundamental para el diagnóstico adecuado de la enfermedad. Las mutaciones o variantes genéticas, las anomalías en la neuroimagen y otras pruebas son biomarcadores potenciales que pueden mejorar el diagnóstico y permitir la identificación de personas en riesgo.",

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Neuropsychiatric ManifestationsThe manifestations of neuropsychiatric illness in lupus erythematosus in order of decreasing frequency are (1) alterations of mental function including organic brain syndromes, affective illnesses, and schizophrenia-like disorders;(2) transient or recurrent seizures, usually generalized, although a variety of forms has been described; (3) paresis resulting from ischemia or hemorrhage; (4) tremor, choreoathetosis, or ataxia; (5) nuclear and infranuclear cranial neuropathies; and (6) peripheral neuropathies, usually of a mixed sensory-motor variety.Feinglass et al. 1 surveyed the relationships of nervous system involvement to other manifestations of the disease.Neuropsychiatric manifestations attributed to central nervous system SLE occurred in 37% of 140 patients, and five of these presented with neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.The most frequent manifestations were psychiatric dysfunction, seizures, long tract signs, cranial neuropathy, and peripheral neuropathy.Psychiatric abnormalities secondary to SLE were characterized by organic features and by associated neurological findings, often diffuse or multifocal.The spinal fluid was abnormal in only 32%, usually a modest elevation of protein (70 to 92 mg/dl) and/or pleocytosis.The EEG was abnormal in 71%, particularly in association with seizures or focal neurological signs.Frequently, central nervous system abnormalities were an early feature, and in 63% neuropsychiatric involvement either",

Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done.

This is to a great extent due to a decreased brain plasticity affecting the formation of memory traces for different sensory stimuli essential for different cognitive operations of the brain. Furthermore, MMN can serve as a measure of recovery or neural reorganization in different neurological disorders. For example, the recovery from aphasic symptoms after stroke was associated with the enhancement of MMN.

Many cognitive functions may be concerned and can be explained by fronto-striatal brain circuits and hippocampus dysfunctions partly through abnormalities related to cerebrovascular diseases. It seems important to distinguish between early and late onset depression whose cognitive characterisation and etiopathogenia differ in some aspects. Cognitive impairment may represent markers of depression but it is still unclear whether one should consider potential biomarkers of disease state or trait or risk factor. These disorders may precede depression and persist despite symptomatic remission. Moreover, the interest of specifying these disorders is multiple because they can have pejorative consequences such as the modification of emotional content, promote suicidal act, limit the effectiveness of psychotherapy, be a risk factor for poor response to antidepressants. or be a potential risk factor for progression to a minor or major neurocognitive disorder, especially Alzheimer's disease.",

      "title": "Seizures and Organ Failure",
      "abstract": "Seizures and epilepsy commonly occur in patients with organ system failure, either as a consequence of trophic effects on cerebral function or of therapies used in such conditions. Acute organ failure results in an abrupt, but often reversible, lowering of seizure threshold, whereas chronic organ failure results in more pervasive and indolent cerebral compromise, often permanently altering both the seizure threshold and the physiologic responses to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Failure of an organ system is not typically a sudden, all-or-none phenomenon but occurs in stages with variable susceptibility to seizures as the condition worsens or remits. Although the principles of diagnosis and management of seizures in adult and pediatric patients with a specific organ dysfunction are similar, the underlying etiologies and influences of comorbid conditions differ between adults and children. Adult organ failure often involves multiple systems to different extents and is superimposed on other chronic diseases of adulthood. Pediatric organ failure is usually the result of inherited metabolic disorders, infections, and unique pediatric susceptibilities to metabolic effects of medications (Table 1).",

Dennoch ist der Synapsen Verlust nicht spezifisch um Alzheimer vorherzusagen. Viele neurodegenerative Erkrankungen zeigen diese Verluste, ebenso wie es eine Erscheinung des normalen Alterns ist. Jedoch ist es der Haupt Risikofaktor fur Demenz.\r\nSynapsen Verlust ist nicht gleich verteilt in allen Gehirnregionen, was bedeutet, dass alters- abhangige Veranderungen nicht uberall auftreten, aber in bestimmten Regionen, wie im Kortex und im Hippocampus.

Estudo de caso único realizado a partir de uma avaliação neuropsicológica com uma idosa de 72 anos com queixa de falhas na memória. Verificou-se que a examinanda não apresentava dificuldades cognitivas proeminentes no momento da avaliação nem dificuldades significativas em suas atividades de vida diária: residia sozinha, fazia as compras da casa, realizava o pagamento das contas sem auxílio e utilizava o transporte público para se deslocar, evidenciando capacidade funcional preservada. No entanto, ela sofreu uma série de perdas em um curto período de tempo: saída dos filhos de casa, diminuição do poder aquisitivo e afastamento de atividades de lazer. A distinção dos sintomas de um DCL e um transtorno depressivo pode ser extremamente complexa. Por vezes, os sintomas se sobrepõem, podendo o DCL ser um fator desencadeante para o transtorno depressivo ou mutuamente. Na ocasião da avaliação, as falhas na memória da examinanda foram melhor explicadas pela depressão. A depressão pode afetar tanto a memória de curto como a de longo prazo, interferindo no processo de aquisição e resgate do que foi memorizado, bem como acarretar falhas atencionais uma vez que, quando o estímulo não é recebido, não pode ser recordado.",

It is also not unusual for other neurological problems, such as epilepsy, to complicate the picture. The question is always whether the intellectual problems are due to a static defect, or are part of a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Many conditions declare themselves with the passage of years. However, a small but significant group of conditions are sufficiently indolent in their progress to cause no obvious deterioration until late adolescence or adulthood. In this situation, a parent or carer may ask the adult neurologist to assess whether the perceived decline in functioning is real, and if so, what the cause is. This situation is often far from clear-cut, and so I will try and provide some guidance for when this difficult diagnostic problem arises.

      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

      "title": "Degenerative Central Nervous System (CNS) Disease",
      "abstract": "The hallmark of degenerative disorders of the CNS is the progressive loss of previously acquired abilities. In infants and young children, a deceleration in the rate of development is often the first presentation: the child falls progressively behind other children and only subsequently loses previously acquired milestones. When the declining developmental quotient is not due to an extrinsic agent or event or to secondary involvement of the CNS by a generalized systemic disease, neurodegenerative disease becomes a consideration.The acquisition of new developmental milestones does not exclude the existence of a degenerative disorder. In healthy infants, strides in development occur sporadically, with a child often appearing to have reached a plateau for several weeks. Initially, it may be only the prolongation of one of these plateaus that leads to suspicion of a progressive neurodegenerative diseaseMost degenerative CNS disorders can be divided clinically into three groups: gray-matter diseases, white-matter diseases, and system diseases. The gray-matter diseases, which primarily involve the neurons, occur with or without histologic evidence of storage of abnormal metabolic products. They lead to neuronal death and secondary degeneration of axons. In the white-matter diseases, myelin is disrupted, either by the destruction of normal myelin or by the production of biochemically abnormal myelin. The system diseases are a heterogeneous group of conditions involving progressive degeneration of anatomically defined systems, such as the dorsal columns,pyramidal tracts, or cerebellar nuclei. Typically, both neurons and myelin are destroyed in these disorders.The first clinical task in evaluating a child for any neurodegenerative disorder is to document that he or she has lost previously acquired milestones or has a decelerating developmental quotient. In either instance, the most important diagnostic tool is repeated developmental evaluations.The major clinical features that differentiate gray-matter from white-matter diseases are related directly to the functional roles of the neurons and myelin. Neuronal involvement in gray-matter disease leads to the early onset of dementia, the progressive loss of cognitive abilities, and seizures that frequently are myoclonic. The basal ganglia and cerebellar nuclei are collections of neurons, so extrapyramidal and cerebellar signs, such as ataxia, are common. Ganglion cells of the retina are affected in many of the gray-matter disorders, producing pigmentary degeneration of the retina. Abnormal storage of lipid in retinal ganglion cells (eg, in Tay-Sachs disease) makes the perifoveal area look gray and opaque. The fovea, which contains no ganglion cells,appears red by contrast, producing the clinically detected \"cherry red spot.\"The majority of degenerative diseases of white matter stem from biochemical defects resulting in abnormal myelin that breaks down rapidly. These\"dysmyelinating\" disorders are called leukodystrophies. Clinically, the earliest sign of most white-matter degenerations is spasticity. Dementia and seizures can occur, but usually later in the clinical course. Extrapyramidal signs are rare, but involvement of cerebellar pathways can cause ataxia. Rather than the cherry-red spot of gray-matter disease,optic atrophy is the most characteristic ocular change seen in white-matter disease. Some patients even have cortical blindness from demyelination of the optic pathways in the cerebral hemispheres.Each of the so-called system diseases has its own signs and symptoms,depending on the particular neural pathways involved. One such disease is Rett syndrome (RS), which is characterized by a period of normal development followed by the loss of developmental milestones and the onset of stereotypic hand movements akin to those seen with autism, followed by seizures and dementia. RS affects girls, probably exclusively, and occurs worldwide. Although most cases are sporadic, the disease has long been suspected of having a genetic basis. Recent genetic advances suggest that the gene for RS is located on the distal arm of the X chromosome.Clinical criteria alone can point to a diagnosis of RS. Usually the antenatal and birth histories are normal, but most girls affected with RS pass through four predictable stages:Stage 1 (birth to ∼18 mo):Deceleration of head growth, beginning between 2 and 4 months of age, results in an acquired microcephaly. This insidious failure of brain growth can be missed if head circumference is not meticulously measured and plotted at health supervision visits. Early in the disease, babies show decreased interest in their environment and become markedly hypotonic.Stage 2 (∼1 to 2 y): The loss of both expressive language and gross motor milestones, and the onset of abnormal hand movements, seizures, irritability,and insomnia are typical of progressing RS.Stage 3 (2 to 10 y): Severe mental retardation, seizures, and persistent stereotypic hand wringing movements characterize the childhood phase of RS. Most patients develop ataxic and wide-based gaits, but many affected girls never walk. Tremulousness is a common finding, as are breath-holding spells. Many children who have RS are misdiagnosed as having Angelman syndrome or ataxic cerebral palsy.Stage 4 (older than 10 y): As girls who have RS approach adolescence,they develop progressive scoliosis,muscle wasting, and can become wheelchair-bound. By the early teenage years, they reach a plateau in their neurologic regression, but death usually occurs during late adolescence from infection or cardiac arrhythmia.Many disorders that have different etiologies may resemble neurodegenerative diseases in clinical presentation:hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, mass and structural lesions of the brain,chromosomal defects, poorly controlled seizures, environmental deprivation,subdural hematomas, and congenital and chronic infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus. Neurodegenerative disorders, unlike these others,are predominantly hereditary. Although the biochemical basis of many neurodegenerative disorders is not fully understood, a precise biochemical diagnosis always should be sought to make possible an accurate discussion of prognosis, to provide counseling, and sometimes to administer specific treatment.Over the past decade, the availability of molecular genetic testing has improved the accuracy of diagnosis in symptomatic patients, prenatally when genetic risk has been identified, and for carrier testing. Many neurodegenerative disorders can be diagnosed by biochemical testing of blood or urine without invasive procedures to obtain tissue for direct examination. Even so, a diagnosis of an altered enzyme disease should be confirmed histologically.In general, treatment is available for only a few of the neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, most remain invariably fatal by late childhood. Dietary therapy, restriction of a substrate or substrate precursor, modification of enzyme activity with cofactor vitamin therapy, and enzyme replacement all have been attempted with only limited success. Hope for more effective treatment comes from developments in molecular genetics that may allow the repair of specific point mutations in the human genome.In 1966, Rett described a syndrome of cerebral atrophy and hyperammonemia that appeared to affect girls exclusively. Experience has shown that elevated ammonia levels are an exception rather than the rule, and no other laboratory or imaging test provides diagnostic confirmation. Once again, we are thrown back on our clinical skills. Girls who have RS develop normally through the first few months of life, until their brains begin to atrophy, leading to acquired microcephaly. They progress to gait apraxia and truncal ataxia, autistic-like behavior, loss of cognitive function, rather typical\"hand-washing\" movements, seizures,and pyramidal tract signs. The dementia is devastating.We usually think of X-linked disorders, which RS appears to be, as primarily affecting boys: factor VIII deficiency,glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Whereas these disorders are recessive, RS may well be inherited dominantly and be lethal to boys because they have only one X chromosome. Hopefully,as Dr Rich remarks, advances in our understanding of the molecular genetics of neurodegenerative disorders like RS will lead to effective treatment.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of learning disabilities",
      "abstract": "Learning disabilities are a heterogeneous diagnostic category. As a specific disorder learning disabilities include reading disorders, disorders of written expression and mathematics disorders. As a general concept, learning disabilities may be categorised into four symptom complexes, which are not mutually exclusive: 1. dyslexia, 2. motor-perceptual; 3. language delay; 4. hyperactivity. In clinical settings these neurodevelopmental disorders are diagnosed in school-aged children. The most common referral reasons are significant difficulties in school achievement or difficulties in child adjustment and functioning that are manifested through behavioural and emotional difficulties caused by learning disabilities. Since academic achievement is an important aspect of self-esteem in childhood, school failure may result in many short-term and long-term consequences for the child’s functioning in narrow and broader social contexts, development of maladaptive behaviour and also cause the development of psychopathology. The most common short-term consequences include low academic and general self-esteem, lack of motivation for schooling and related obligations, behavioural disorders, a sense of overload in the child, peer relationship problems and a heightened level of family conflicts. The usual long-term outcomes are psychosomatic problems, affective disorders (depression, anxiety) and severe behavioural problems. Furthermore, longitudinal studies show the persistence of certain problems in adulthood.In summary, impairments should be adequately assessed to evaluate the cognitive deficits and strengths, and a precise diagnosis should be established. Once problem areas have been identified, special teaching strategies can be devised in collaboration with the school to circumvent handicaps. Also, an important part of intervention includes counselling of parents and children.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

Due to the absence of specific symptoms, it is frequently misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder, which delays treatment. The cases of two patients who exhibited psychiatric symptoms and subtle cognitive disturbances (without confusion) as the sole manifestation of frontal lobe NCSE are reported. Both patients were initially treated as psychiatric disorders (depression and anorexia nervosa). The correct diagnosis was established by the electroencephalographic study, in one case after the patient experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and in the other, after failure to improve with supposedly adequate treatment. There are reports of patients with NCSE whose symptoms suggest a psychiatric disorder (inappropriate behavior, emotional disinhibition, perseveration, reduced speech and motivation). This can occur without altered consciousness and symptoms may fluctuate, making the correct diagnosis extremely difficult. This entity can occur at any age and without a previous history of seizures. A high level of suspicion is necessary for prompt electroencephalographic study to confirm the diagnosis. Early treatment will correct the symptoms and significantly improve quality of life for patients and their families.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neurometabolic diseases are a group of disorders that lead to a disruption in the normal metabolism within the body and nervous system. Abnormalities of metabolic processes at any level can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical features and pathologies. The nervous system is particularly susceptible to metabolic derangements, either inborn or acquired. Early diagnosis can prevent or delay damage to the nervous system through appropriate treatment when possible. Many neurometabolic disorders have poor prognoses, and patients often present and succumb within months to the early years of life; however, some disorders can present later in life with varying levels of severity. In many later onset cases, the diagnosis is preceded by nonspecific symptoms including psychiatric manifestations. In addition to psychiatric manifestations, various neurological features often occur at some point in the course of the disease. Of these features, movement disorders are particularly common. In fact, many neurometabolic diseases will present with subtle movement disorders that are often missed or overlooked. Many congenital metabolic diseases are rapidly neurodegenerative and, due to the nature of such diseases, result in early demise or severe cognitive decline. While by no means exhaustive, this chapter aims to outline and discuss some of the neurometabolic diseases that present with both psychiatric and movement disorders as prominent features.",

      "title": "The causes of schizophrenia in adolescents",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is one of the ten most disabling diseases in the world, mainly manifested by different syndromes such as incoordination of mental activity and behavior. Its pathogenesis and influencing factors are still unclear. Schizophrenia occurs mainly in patients who are in adolescence or just entering adulthood. Men are more likely to get the disease than women, and the disease course is longer, and is prone to recurring, exacerbating, or worsening. Research shows that the main causes of schizophrenia can be divided into psychosocial and biological factors. Among the social psychological factors, such as abnormal personality, it may lead to contradictory psychological phenomena; among family factors, the economic level is low, the family relationship is bad, and major psychological shocks are encountered; or social factors such as religious beliefs may lead to schizophrenia disease. Among the biological factors, schizophrenia can be caused due to the poor condition of genes. Genetic factors are the main pathogenic factors of schizophrenia. ErbB4, Dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (DTNBP1), Neuregulin-1 (NRG1), neurotransmitter dopamine and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes are biological factors that lead to schizophrenia. This article mainly discusses the etiology of adolescent schizophrenia. Risk factors for schizophrenia are abnormal personality and adverse genetic factors. By far the most important causative factor is due to biological genetic factors. In new scientific research, CRISPR technology may be able to cure genotype schizophrenia by modifying genes. However, maintaining a healthy mind or seeking medical attention when a problem is discovered can prevent mental illness in time.",

Compensation is the most common strategy for memory disorders, but not the best.

      "title": "Suggestions for the decision making in subjective cognitive complaints",
      "abstract": "In recent years, the increasing life expectancy has underscored the importance of cognitive health alongside physical well-being, particularly because healthy adults may report subjective cognitive complaints (SCC), often related to memory. These complaints may or may not align with objective cognitive impairments, fueling ongoing debates about whether SCC could serve as an early indicator of dementia. While some studies suggest SCC as a potential precursor to dementia, others propose that these complaints may merely co-occur with cognitive decline. Despite the lack of consensus, addressing SCC remains crucial for early intervention, especially as emerging treatments for dementia show promise when applied at early stages. Risk factors associated with dementia, such as age, education, family history, and comorbid conditions like depression and diabetes, have been incorporated into predictive models. However, clinical practice continues to rely heavily on neuropsychological assessments to bridge subjective complaints with objective cognitive performance and may often require additional investigations, such as neuroimaging. Factors such as cognitive reserve, depression, stress, sleep disturbances, and personality traits also play significant roles in the interpretation of SCC. Some of these conditions may potentially mask underlying cognitive decline. A comprehensive clinical evaluation, integrating neuropsychological testing with a thorough anamnesis, can help distinguish between cognitive disorders and other contributing factors. Here, we propose a flowchart to guide clinicians in the management of SCC, integrating key factors to enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment decisions. Despite the challenges involved, a careful and holistic approach remains essential for effective patient care.",

The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

      "abstract": "New-onset vertigo, dizziness and gait imbalance are amongst the most common symptoms presenting to the emergency department, accounting for 2.1-4.4% of all patients. The broad spectrum of underlying causes in these patients cuts across many specialties, which often results in diagnostic challenges. For patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for acute vestibular syndrome (AVS, i.e., presenting with acute-onset prolonged vertigo/dizziness with accompanying gait imbalance, motion intolerance, nausea/vomiting, with or without nystagmus), the typical differential diagnosis is vertebrobasilar stroke and acute unilateral vestibulopathy. However, other disorders may also present with AVS. These include non-neurological causes such as drug side-effects or intoxication, electrolyte disturbances, cardiac disease, severe anemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, endocrine disorders and others. Other non-stroke neurological disorders may also present with AVS or episodic vertigo/dizziness, including demyelinating CNS diseases, posterior fossa mass lesions, acute thiamine deficiency and vestibular migraine. Furthermore, acute physiological abnormalities (e.g., hypotension, fever, severe anemia) may unmask previous vestibular impairments that had been well-compensated. Here, we review the diagnostic approach to patients with acute-onset dizziness in the emergency room and discuss the most important differential diagnoses beyond stroke and acute unilateral vestibulopathy.",

      "title": "What Is a Good Approach to Thinking About a Child With Multiple Dysmorphisms?",
      "abstract": "A dysmorphism is difference in a body structure. If the dysmorphia is truly the only abnormality that you see in the child, further evaluation is often unnecessary. Isolated dysmorphisms are typically caused by malformation (abnormal tissue development), deformation (distortion caused by a mechanic force), disruption (destruction of a normal forming structure), or dysplasia (anomaly of growth and differentiation). A patient with multiple dysmorphisms, however, typically requires further workup to arrive at the cause, which could be chromosomal, genetic, or environmental such as in utero exposure to teratogen or infection. 1 Making the diagnosis relies on recognizing the pattern of dysmorphisms. The 4 major patterns to consider are the following 2 : Association: Physical features that often occur together more often than would be seen by chance alone, but no single etiology is yet known to explain the pattern. Vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac defects, trachea esophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb anomalies (VACTERL) are examples of associations with no unifying etiology. Sequence: A group of defects that stem from a sequential set of events that began with one malformation. An example is Potter sequence with renal agenesis resulting in no fetal urine production, which leads to severe oligohydramnios with the consequences of lung hypoplasia and intrauterine constraint that cause limb deformities and compressed facial features. Syndrome: A cluster of anomalies that occur in a consistent pattern that has a unifying cause, known or unknown. Developmental field defect: A group of malformations caused by harm to a particular region of the embryo. An example is hemifacial microsomia, unilateral facial hypoplasia, and ear anomalies that come from anomalous development of the first and second brachial arch structures.",

      "title": "REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) as a marker of neurodegenerative disorders",
      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) can occur in the absence of any other obvious asso- ciated neurologic disorder or in association with a neurodegenerative disease, in which case it is considered as symptomatic RBD. RBD is frequently associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD), Lewy body dementia or multiple system atrophy (MSA), and in several cases may even antedate the occurrence of motor symptoms by decades. When no neurologic disorder is obvious, RBD can be considered as idiopathic (iRBD). Several studies have looked at neurophysiologic and neuropsychological functions in iRBD and have found evidence of CNS dysfunc- tion during both wakefulness and sleep in a variable proportion of these patients, challenging the concept of iRBD. Identifying subjects with a high risk of developing a neurodegenerative process may be crucial in order to develop early intervention strategies. Some prospective results in iRBD showed that potential markers of neuro- degeneration are the following: 1) marked EEG slowing on spectral analysis; 2) decreased striatal 123I-FPCIT; 3) impaired color vision.",

      "title": "MO1023BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME OR SENIOR-LOKEN SYNDROME? GOING BEYOND THE OBVIOUS",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Nephronophthisis (NPHP), a ciliopathy which almost always causes end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), may have extrarenal symptoms such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Senior-Loken syndrome (SLS), and these are called NPHP-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC). Bardet-Bield syndrome and SLS share similar clinical features, so that definitive diagnosis might depend on genetic analysis. Bardet-Bield syndrome diagnosis is typically based on clinical manifestations, which comprise, for example, renal defects, polydactyly, obesity, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), learning difficulties, in addition to secondary manifestations such as development delay, speech defects, hypertension, among others. Senior-Loken syndrome classical encompasses familial NPHP and RP; additional variable features can include skeletal, liver, neurologic and other visual defects, as well as obesity. NPHP genes are the most commonly affected in NPHP. Although disruption of the NPHP5 and NPHP6 genes are the most frequent cause of SLS, at least variants in ten genes have been reported. We present a case of a young girl clinically diagnosed with BBS, later known to be a SLS based on genetic analysis, revealing an unusual affected gene. Method We reviewed this case based on medical records. Results The patient presented with polydactyly at birth and pre-obesity in the first six months of age. At the age of 4 years she was first evaluated by ophthalmology due to reduced visual acuity which evolved unfavorably with severe generalized retinal dysfunction and moderate maculopathy at the age of 9 years. Delayed development and poor social skills were increasingly evident, as wells as short stature, small hands and dysmorphic facial features. At the age of 12 years bilateral transmission hearing loss was diagnosed and two years later she was referred to Endocrinology due to hirsutism, stretch marks and cushingoid facies. In this context, blood work was performed and surprisingly revealed plasma creatinine of 2.19 mg/dL and urea of 65 mg/dL. Kidney ultrasound revealed reduced dimensions and increased parenchymal echogenicity; an obstructive component was excluded. She rapidly progressed to ESKD and dialysis dependence. Bardet-Biedl syndrome was considered. She was referred for transplant assessment and underwent genetic testing. A homozygous likely pathogenic variant was identified in TRAF3IP1 gene, compatible with SLS 9 (autosomal recessive inheritance). Conclusion Although phenotype-based diagnosis was common in ciliopathies, genetic testing is now regularly used for definitive diagnosis. Mutations in the geneTRAF3IP1 were only recently described, particularly in patients presenting with NPHP, RP, skeletal defects, hepatic fibrosis and hexadactyly; ESKD is frequent between 3 and 16 years and SLS is formally associated. Our patient had several clinical manifestations suggestive of BBS, and presumptive diagnosis was assumed (although noticeable phenotypic overlap with SLS exists). Genetic analysis was crucial; the identified mutation in TRAF3IP1 justifies some of the extra-SLS/BBS-like manifestations. Patients must be monitored carefully, namely related to ESKD and extrarenal manifestations; there is also the need for segregation analysis (divorced parents and half-brothers). Ultimately this case represents a consequence of genetics evolution, with a wide genetic and clinical variability now described within these syndromes.",

      "title": "[Perioperative disorders of mental functions].",
      "abstract": "Mental disorders are characterized by disturbances of thought, perception, affect and behavior, which occur as a result of brain damage. Recognizing and treating these conditions is necessary not only for psychiatrists but for all physicians. Disorder of mental function is one of the most common associated conditions in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, disturbances of mental function often remain unrecognized. In ICU patients, different types of mental function disorders may develop. They range from sleep disorders, severe depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cognitive disorders including delirium. The causes of mental dysfunction in ICU patients can be divided into environmental and medical. Cognitive disorders are related to mental processes such as learning ability, memory, perception and problem solving. Cognitive disorders are usually not prominent in the early postoperative period and in many cases are discovered after hospital discharge because of difficulties in performing everyday activities at home or at work. The etiology of postoperative cognitive impairment is unclear. Older age, previous presence of cognitive dysfunction, severity of disease, and polypharmacy with more than four drugs are some of the risk factors identified. Delirium is a multifactorial disorder. It is an acute confusional state characterized by alteration of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. It is considered as the most common form of mental distress in ICU patients. Nearly 30% of all hospitalized patients pass through deliriant phase during their hospital stay. Delirium can last for several days to several weeks. Almost always it ends with complete withdrawal of psychopathological symptoms. Sometimes it can evolve into a chronic brain syndrome (dementia). The causes are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease the symptoms. Delirious patient is at risk of complications of immobility and confusion, leading to a high prevalence of irreversible functional decline. An interdisciplinary approach to delirium should also include family or other caregivers. In the diagnosis of delirium, several tests are used to complement clinical assessment. Among the most commonly used are the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test. Depression is a common disorder among patients treated at ICU and occurs due to the impact of the disease on the body and the quality of life, independence, employment and other aspects of life. Depression can interfere with the speed of recovery, affects the postoperative quality of life, and in a certain number of patients may lead to suicidal thoughts and intentions. Phobias and generalized anxiety are the most common anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by strong, excessive anxiety and worry about everyday life events. PTSD is delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation, extremely threatening or catastrophic nature, which is outside the common experience of people and would hit or traumatize almost all people. Treatment of delirium and other disorders is causal. The causes of psychosis are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease symptoms. The primary objective of prevention is appropriate therapy and correction of potential imbalances possibly underlying disturbances, stabilization of vital functions as well as early return to daily activities. Doctors and other medical staff must be aware of the importance and consequences of behavioral and emotional disorders in critically ill patients. Additional research is needed to discover the ways to prevent and/ or reduce the frequency and severity of the consequences and treatment of cognitive and emotional disorders.",

The Supreme Court of Korea has sometimes tried to take into account of mental and emotional injuries in determining whether the defendant has imposed `bodily injuries` on the victim. However, it still hesitates to announce that mental injury is a part of bodily injuries. To the contrary, the United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines state that: “bodily injury” means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation. Impairment of a function of mental faculty will be counted on finding criminal liability under the guidelines. Too many victims are suffering from mental and emotional injuries after the criminal accident. Typical symptoms are including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder but the victims are not qualified for the compensation from the government. Furthermore, the criminal courts do not care about what has visibly happened on the brains of criminal victims. They are often ignoring recent developments in the neuro-science, which clearly shows that mental defects are resulted from the criminal act on the victims. We need to re-define what is injury. Imposing mental illness on victim must be punished on a charge of injuring. It will help the criminal victims recover from the post-traumatic symptoms and get back to their daily lifes.",

      "title": "‘When Did My Tremor Start’: Can Essential Tremor Patients Pinpoint Their Disease Onset",
      "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological disorders among adults, and it is the most common tremor disorder.[1-8] As in other neurodegenerative diseases, age of onset in ET is chiefly assessed by the patients’ (or occasionally their caregivers’) self-report, which may be of little documentary value. Surprisingly, there have been few data that have examined the accuracy of patients’ reports of age of onset in ET.\r\n\r\nIn ET, dating the onset is not a trivial issue. Indeed, age of onset is a variable of considerable importance. First, late-onset ET could have different biochemical and neuropathological underpinnings from earlier onset ET.[9, 10] Second, as in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease,[11, 12] an association between older age of onset and mild cognitive impairment and dementia has been reported in ET (i.e., ET patients with older age of onset are more likely to have mild cognitive impairment and demented than are ET patients with younger age of onset, and older onset of ET is a risk factor for incident dementia). Third, age of onset is crucial when determining the rate of progression in cross-sectional studies.[9]\r\n\r\nIn this issue of Neuroepidemiology, Louis [13] analyzed the agreement in data on age of onset in 86 patients with ET from a prospective, epidemiological study in New York. Patients with ET cases were assessed at two time points (baseline and follow-up), and data on age of onset were collected each time by self-report. Despite the observation that agreement between the baseline and follow-up reports was high (ρ = 0.85, p 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study are of special interest. Aside from the fact that only a prior pilot study, conducted by the same group, had addressed this reliability issue in ET,[14] there were no other published data to aid clinicians and researchers. The study had several strengths, including the large sample size, the exhaustive study of the patients and the well thought-out approach to the statistical analyses. The study was not without limitations. Specifically, only 86 of 376 ET patients initially enrolled were followed up. However, these 86 enrollees were similar to the larger group of 376 from which they were drawn in terms of baseline tremor severity, baseline tremor duration and baseline age.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside issues of strengths and limitations, the study again demonstrates that age of onset, overall, is reliably reported. Yet investigators should approach these self-reports with some degree of caution. Differences in reported age of onset in ET can vary widely, and in up 1/5 of patients may be substantial. Louis [13] has proposed several approaches to supplement self-reported data in future studies. One approach would be to examine hand-writing samples (e.g., signatures, letters) retrospectively, as an objective record of the possible onset and development of tremor. Another one would be to use collateral history from family members. Despite this, the main question is “when does ET really start”. The answer still remains uncertain. Given the heterogeneous nature of ET,[15] this may differ depending on the cause/s of the syndrome. When and where the neuropathological process develops in ET still remains uncertain.",

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is often used to describe a person's level of consciousness after injury or medical event. Brain death is the determination of death by neurological criteria. Components of the brain death determination process include a clinical exam documenting the complete absence of all brain stem reflexes and an apea test documenting absent respirations in the setting of hypercarbia.

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "abstract": "Conversion disorders are characterized by change or loss of physical functions which indicates a neurological disorder (e.g. paralysis, sensory disturbances, or epilepsy like seizures). Clinical/neurological examination does not confirm any organic basis for the symptoms. Conversion disorders are more frequent in girls than in boys. They are rarely seen below the age of seven. A correspondence is often found between the personality of the child, (a conscientious attitude) and family relations. The families seem quite normal, but often have high expectations of their children, are sensitive to social stigmatization and have an underlying anxiety for health problems. A model is often found for the child's symptoms. Symptoms may be precipitated by an infection or a physical trauma. Sexual abuse is sometimes discovered. Multiprofessional assessment and treatment by a neuropediatrician, physiotherapist, child psychiatrist/psychologist and educational therapist may reduce \"doctor shopping\" and contribute to a favourable outcome.",

      "abstract": "Certain features of abnormal memory, which have figured prominently in theoretical treatments of the amnesic syndrome, were assessed in patients with Korsakoff's syndrome, in Case N.A., and in patients receiving electroconvulsive therapy. Patients with Korsakoff's syndrome differed from the other patients by (a) failing to exhibit release from proactive interference, and (b) being disproportionately impaired in the ability to make judgments about the temporal order of recent events. These deficits appear to be related to frontal lobe damage and are superimposed on a more basic memory disorder. Theories of amnesia should be founded on the basic memory disorder and not on deficits such as these, which have no obligatory relationship to amnesia. Dissociations between aspects of memory, revealed by the study of amnesia, can also shed light on the organization of memory in the brain.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a common, serious neurological disease, with prevalence of 1% and a cumulative lifetime risk of 5%. An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

У 75 больных катарактой изучалось их клинико-психопатологическое состояние методом тестирования и собеседования в предоперационном периоде (за 1-2 суток до операции). Были использованы следующие методики исследования: опросник Г. Айзенка, личностный тест Леонгарда Шмишека, шкала оценки депрессии Монтгомери Асберга, госпитальная шкала тревоги и депрессии НАDS. Результаты. В большинстве случаев больные катарактой имеют личностный профиль, структуру которого определяет меланхолик-интроверт возбудимого, эмотивного или педантичного типа. Пятая часть больных катарактой не обнаруживает каких-либо проявлений подавленности, расстройств сна, аппетита и других психоэмоциональных и нервно-психических нарушений, что может быть расценено как свидетельство достаточной устойчивости и силы личности этих больных. Невротическая симптоматика, так же как и психоэмоциональные расстройства, оказались менее выраженными у мужчин, чем у женщин. Выводы. Выявленное различие клинических проявлений коморбидной нервно-психической патологии у больных катарактой мужчин и женщин определяет необходимость при разработке терапевтических программ учета их гендерных особенностей (большая выраженность аффективного компонента у женщин, различие структуры невротических расстройств и др.).",

The patient’s body mass index (BMI) should not limit the consideration of bulimia given the spectrum (low to high) of BMI that can present with the class of binge eating disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy with possible adjunctive pharmacologic antidepressants is most successful in the early stages of the disease. Relapse after initial treatment is common.",

The site of injury can be in the cell bodies (i.e., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] or sensory ganglionopathies), axons (i.e., axonal peripheral neuropathies or brachial plexopathies), Schwann cells (i.e., chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy), neuromuscular junction (i.e., myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome), muscle (i.e., inflammatory myopathy or muscular dystrophy), or any combination of these sites. Some neuromuscular diseases are also associated with central nervous system disease, such as ALS, but most are restricted to the peripheral nervous system. The multitude of possible sites of injury can make neuromuscular diseases difficult to diagnose. Here the author reviews key features of the clinical presentation that help localize the site of injury and some basic tenets of electromyography. He then shares several pearls in diagnosing and treating patients with specific neuromuscular diseases.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

Due to many genetic and biochemical aberrations, people with DS suffer from several somatic disorders and concomitant diseases. Epilepsies occur more often than in the normal population, but less often than with intellectual disability of other causes. Epilepsies in DS have a trimodal distribution with age-related phenotypes, etiologies, and prognosis. The most common epilepsy syndrome in infancy is the often-self-limiting West syndrome; if Lennox–Gastaut syndrome occurs in the later course of development, the seizure prognosis worsens significantly. From the fourth decade of life, myoclonic epilepsy often occurs, which in combination with rapidly progressive Alzheimer’s dementia is life-limiting within a few years.",

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "abstract": "Εισαγωγή: Ένα χαρακτηριστικό κλινικό εύρημα σε ασθενείς με νόσο Alzheimer (ΝΑ), την συχνότερη μορφή άνοιας, όσο και σε άτομα με Ήπια Νοητική Διαταραχή (ΗΝΔ) είναι, πέραν των διαταραχών μνήμης, οι διαταραχές λόγου. Οι δυσκολίες αυτές αποτελούν παράγοντα σημαντικής νοσηρότητας και δυσλειτουργίας στην καθημερινότητα των ασθενών. Επιπλέον, ανάμεσα στις άτυπες μορφές της ΝΑ υπάρχει και ένα σύνδρομο με προεξέχουσες διαταραχές στο λόγο, η Πρωτοπαθής Προϊούσα Αφασία (ΠΠΑ). Από την άλλη, οι διαταραχές του λόγου είναι κύρια εκδήλωση της Μετωποκροταφικής Άνοιας (ΜΚΑ), η οποία έχει διαφορετικό παθολογο-ανατομικό υπόβαθρο και παθοφυσιολογικό μηχανισμό από την ΝΑ. Αυτό υποδηλώνει ότι ασθενείς που διαγιγνώσκονται κλινικά με ΝΑ θα μπορούσαν να έχουν παθοφυσιολογικό υπόβαθρο ΜΚΑ και το αντίστροφο.ΣκοπόςΣτόχος της παρούσας διατριβής ήταν η αναζήτηση και μελέτη γενετικών και άλλων παραγόντων που μπορεί να συμβάλλουν στην ανάπτυξη ΗΝΔ και άνοιας γενικότερα, αλλά και ειδικότερα αφασικών διαταραχών, ώστε να γίνει κατανοητή καλύτερα η παθογένεια και η φαινοτυπική έκφραση της ΝΑ και της ΜΚΑ.Μέθοδοι/ΑποτελέσματαH παρούσα διατριβή αναπτύχθηκε σε τέσσερα επίπεδα:Α) Έγινε ανάλυση του κλινικού φαινοτύπου των ασθενών με άνοια (κυρίως ΝΑ) και ΗΝΔ (n=363) από τη Μελέτη Γήρανσης της Κρήτης (ΜΓΚ) και την αντίστοιχη Μελέτη ΣΚΕΨΗ ως προς την ύπαρξη διαταραχών λόγου. Οι αναλύσεις αυτές έδειξαν ότι ένα μεγάλο ποσοστό των ασθενών είχε αφασική διαταραχή (31.6%). Επιπλέον, όταν αναλύσαμε ξεχωριστά τους ασθενείς με προεξέχουσες διαταραχές λόγου αλλά όχι διαταραχές στη μνήμη, καταλήξαμε ότι το 13.7% του συνόλου των ασθενών είναι πιθανό να πληροί τα κριτήρια για ΠΠΑ.Β) Έγινε μελέτη των αποτελεσμάτων αλληλούχισης ολικού εξώματος (WES) ασθενών με διάγνωση ΝΑ (n=95) και ΗΝΔ (n=20) και νοητικά φυσιολογικών ατόμων (n= 81) από την ΜΓΚ για την παρουσία παθογόνων αλλαγών σε γονίδια που σχετίζονται με την ΜΚΑ (η οποία έχει ως μία από τις κύριες εκφράσεις της τις διαταραχές στο λόγο), αλλά και την νευροεκφύλιση γενικότερα. Αυτό οδήγησε:1) Στην ανίχνευση της αλλαγής p.Ile383Val στο (σχετιζόμενο με ΜΚΑ) γονίδιο TARDBP σε 2 ασθενείς από την ΜΓΚ με διάγνωση ΝΑ. Αυτή η αλλαγή και άλλες 2 αλλαγές στο ίδιο γονίδιο βρέθηκαν και σε 4 ασθενείς (μη μέλη της ΜΓΚ) με ΜΚΑ/Νόσο Κινητικού Νευρώνα (ΝΚΝ). 2) Στην ανάδειξη του πιθανού προστατευτικού ρόλου της p.Ser498Ala αλλαγής στο γονίδιο GLUD2 (κωδικοποιεί την hGDH2 πρωτεΐνη) ως προς την ανάπτυξη άνοιας του τύπου της ΝΑ. Συγκεκριμένα, η αλλαγή αυτή ήταν λιγότερο συχνή σε ασθενείς με ΝΑ (2,11 %) από ό,τι στην ομάδα ελέγχου (16%, p&lt;0,01). Τα αποτελέσματα αυτά ελέγχθηκαν σε μεγαλύτερο πληθυσμό, τόσο από την Κρήτη όσο και από το Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), και παρόλο που υπήρχε μία αντίστοιχη τάση με αυτήν της αρχικής μελέτης μας, αυτή δεν έφτασε σε στατιστική σημαντικότητα.3) Στην διαπίστωση, ως επιβεβαίωση της γενετικής εγκυρότητας του πληθυσμού μας, ότι το αλληλόμορφο APOE ε4 ήταν πιο συχνό σε ασθενείς με ΝΑ (23,2%) από ότι στην ομάδα ελέγχου (7,4%; p&lt;0,01).Γ) Λόγω της αναδυόμενης σημασίας (από τα δικά μας αλλά και από ευρήματα άλλων ερευνητών) της TDP43 πρωτεΐνης (κωδικοποιείται από το TARDBP γονίδιο) στην παθοφυσιολογία πολλών νευροεκφυλιστικών νοσημάτων, συμπεριλαμβανομένης και της ΝΑ, της ΜΚΑ και της ΝΚΝ μελετήσαμε την έκφρασή της σε εγκεφάλους ασθενών με άνοια, του τύπου της ΝΑ, από την Κρητική Τράπεζα Εγκεφάλων. Αυτό ανέδειξε την παρουσία εναποθέσεων της TDP43 στο 90% (9/10) των ασθενών.Δ) Λόγω του πιθανού προστατευτικού ρόλου της p.Ser498Ala αλλαγής της hGDH2 (η οποία οδηγεί σε gain of function) στην νευροεκφύλιση που σχετίζεται με την άνοια, πραγματοποιήσαμε πειράματα σε κυτταρικές σειρές HEK293 οι οποίες υπερεκφράζουν τα ένζυμα hGDH1 και hGDH2. Αφού επιβεβαιώθηκε ότι τα ένζυμα συνεντοπίζονται υποκυτταρικά με τη χρήση συνεστιακής μικροσκοπίας, πραγματοποιήθηκε μια σειρά προκαταρκτικών πειραμάτων που έδειξαν ότι τα κύτταρα που υπερεκφράζουν την hGDH2 έχουν αυξημένη βιωσιμότητα. Αυτό το εύρημα είναι συμβατό με τον πιθανό νευροπροστατευτικό ρόλο της gain of function p.Ser498Ala αλλαγής της hGDH2 στην άνοια. ΣυμπέρασματαΑναδείξαμε στην μελέτη μας ότι ασθενείς με κλινική διάγνωση ΝΑ θα μπορούσαν να έχουν ένα κλινικό, γενετικό και παθοφυσιολογικό υπόβαθρο που να σχετίζεται με ΜΚΑ, την προεξάρχουσα νόσο όπου εμφανίζεται, ως κύριο χαρακτηριστικό, διαταραχή του λόγου. Επίσης, βρήκαμε ότι σημαντικό ρόλο στην παθοφυσιολογία των δύο αυτών νευροεκφυλιστικών αυτών νοσημάτων παίζουν οι πρωτεΐνες TDP43 και hGDH2. Αυτά τα ευρήματα αναδεικνύουν την μεγάλη φαινοτυπική και παθοφυσιολογική αλληλεπικάλυψη μεταξύ των νόσων που προκαλούν άνοια.",

      "abstract": "Introducción: la categoría de los Trastornos neurocognitivos (TNC), también llamados Demencias, incluye a aquellos trastornos en los que el déficit clínico principal es la falla en una o más funciones cognitivas y que son adquiridos. La Demencia de Inicio Temprano (DIT) se define como un TNC mayor que comienza antes de los 65 años, con diversas causas etiológicas y un impacto significativo en los costos de salud y calidad de vida familiar. Los síntomas neuropsiquiátricos, como la depresión y la ansiedad, pueden ser causas no neurodegenerativas de deterioro y quejas cognitivas. Este estudio se enfoca en describir el rendimiento en la Evaluación Neurocognitiva (ENC) y la presencia de depresión, ansiedad, y otros síntomas neuropsiquiátricos en jóvenes que consultan por quejas cognitivas en un servicio de neurología. Materiales y métodos: estudio descriptivo, retrospectivo basado en informes de ENC de pacientes jóvenes (≤64 años) que consultaron por quejas cognitivas entre junio de 2018 y diciembre de 2022. Se excluyeron pacientes con antecedentes de trastornos del neurodesarrollo. Los informes clasificaron a los pacientes en categorías basadas en su rendimiento cognitivo y la afectación en actividades de la vida diaria. Además, se recopilaron datos demográficos, antecedentes neurológicos y psiquiátricos, y se utilizaron escalas para evaluar síntomas neuropsiquiátricos. Resultados: de las 214 ENC, 54.21 % resultaron normales, mientras que las restantes mostraron diversos grados de deterioro cognitivo. No se encontraron diferencias estadísticamente significativas en la presencia de depresión o ansiedad entre los grupos con ENC normal y patológica. Sin embargo, el 84 % de los casos presentó síntomas neuropsiquiátricos según informes de familiares, siendo la depresión y la ansiedad los más reportados. Conclusiones: en más de la mitad de la muestra se obtuvo un rendimiento cognitivo normal y en el resto algún grado de deterioro cognitivo. Se detectó una alta frecuencia de síntomas neuropsiquiátricos. Se subraya la importancia de una ENC completa y la detección de síntomas neuropsiquiátricos para una intervención temprana en pacientes jóvenes.",

People with chronic mental health problems suffer from more physical ill health than the rest of the population (Joukamaa et al., 2001). Psychiatrists draw upon their background knowledge of physical medicine far more frequently than is commonly appreciated by the rest of the medical profession.

Dementia may be symptomatic of a range of reversible medical and psychiatric conditions which appear to be indistinguishable from primary neuronal degeneration of the Alzheimer's type. While Alzheimer's disease is a neuropathological diagnosis, the importance of establishing a presumptive diagnosis which can be employed for investigational as well as clinical use is underscored. This paper proposes a diagnostic schema which reflects the current understanding of this disorder. There must be evidence of gradual progressive mental deterioration in attention, learning, memory, cognitive style, motivation, and higher order thinking. A comprehensive medical and psychiatric evaluation is obligatory to eliminate reversible physical illness, psychiatric disorder, or cerebrovascular condition as underlying causes of cognitive dysfunction.",

      "title": "Is there a difference between elderly and younger patients with regard to the symptomatology and aetiology of depression?",
      "abstract": "There are some differences between younger and older people regarding the symptomatology of depressive disorders. Elderly people report less depressed mood. There is a high rate of anxiety in elderly patients with major depressive disorders compared with younger depressive patients. The high coexistence of anxiety and depression in the elderly suggests that depression is part of a depression-anxiety syndrome. Depression in elderly people is often hidden behind somatic symptoms, either because of somatization of the disorder or because of accentuation of symptoms of concomitant illness. Cognitive impairment caused by depression is usually referred to as pseudo-dementia or depression with dementia, and it is important to differentiate this condition from predementia. These types of symptoms are more common in elderly than in younger patients. Psychotic symptoms are also seen to a greater extent in the elderly. Some of the differences seen between younger and older people regarding the symptomatology of depressive disorders may be due to pathoplastic effects of aging and to differences between birth cohorts. Moreover, the aetiology of depression is more heterogeneous in elderly people than in younger. Inheritance has a lower impact in elderly people. However, biochemical changes in the aging brain and changes in neurodegenerative disorders are of importance. In these disorders, disturbances of the monoamines are recorded which evidently reduce the threshold for depression in the elderly; Depression is seen concomitantly with some somatic disorders. In several of these disorders, the illness presents initially with depression. Psychosociogenic factors also have importance for depression in late life. Married adults are at lower risk for depression than unmarried ones, and 30% of spouses of demented patients develop depressive disorders.",

      "title": "Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of the Overtraining Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Successful training not only must involve overload but also must avoid the combination of excessive overload plus inadequate recovery. Athletes can experience short-term performance decrement without severe psychological or lasting other negative symptoms. This functional overreaching will eventually lead to an improvement in performance after recovery. When athletes do not sufficiently respect the balance between training and recovery, nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR) can occur. The distinction between NFOR and overtraining syndrome (OTS) is very difficult and will depend on the clinical outcome and exclusion diagnosis. The athlete will often show the same clinical, hormonal, and other signs and symptoms. A keyword in the recognition of OTS might be \"prolonged maladaptation\" not only of the athlete but also of several biological, neurochemical, and hormonal regulation mechanisms. It is generally thought that symptoms of OTS, such as fatigue, performance decline, and mood disturbances, are more severe than those of NFOR. However, there is no scientific evidence to either confirm or refute this suggestion. One approach to understanding the etiology of OTS involves the exclusion of organic diseases or infections and factors such as dietary caloric restriction (negative energy balance) and insufficient carbohydrate and/or protein intake, iron deficiency, magnesium deficiency, allergies, and others together with identification of initiating events or triggers. In this article, we provide the recent status of possible markers for the detection of OTS. Currently, several markers (hormones, performance tests, psychological tests, and biochemical and immune markers) are used, but none of them meet all the criteria to make their use generally accepted.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common causes of dementia, but requires neuropathological verification for a definitive diagnosis because there are a number of other neurodegenerative diseases that may present with dementia. Some of these disorders have considerable overlap both clinically and pathologically with AD, while others have distinct clinical and pathological profiles. Vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) have the greatest overlap with AD and considerable controversy still surrounds the exact contribution of the non AD pathology to the dementia syndrome. The frontotemporal dementias are loosely united by clinical presentation, but are pathologically heterogeneous and include Pick's disease, dementia lacking distinctive histopathology, motor neuron disease inclusion dementia and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). CBD can be difficult to distinguish from progressive supranuclear palsy, especially when the latter lacks the distinctive gaze palsy. Finally, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) may be difficult to distinguish from AD when the symptoms progress at an atypically slow pace. Recently, a new variant of CJD (vCJD) that has been linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy ('mad cow' disease) has heightened awareness of these prion protein disorders. The neuropathological criteria for the diagnosis of these non AD dementia disorders will be reviewed.",

La presencia conduce a deterioro fisico y cognitivo del paciente, en relacion al componete cognitivo los factores mas reportadas son deficits en funciones ejecutivas, atencion, velocidad de procesamiento, habilidades visoespaciales y memoria, pocos estudios han reportado las alteraciones que presentan los pacientes con EM en aspectos del lenguaje, especificamente en el componente pragmatico, referido como la comprension de aspectos del significado de enunciados emitidos de los cuales no se puede obtener informacion de la intencion del hablante por una referencia directa o el lenguaje literal. En la literatura ha sugerido que las fallas en el componente pragmatico subyacen a la interaccion de otros dominios cognitivos. Existen 2 modelos que intentan explicar esta hipotesis identificando por un lado a las Funciones Ejecutivas (FE) y por otro a las Habilidades Visoespaciales (HV) en otras poblaciones como demencia tipo Alzheimer, siendo estas funciones tipicamente alteradas en EM. El objetivo del trabajo es examinar el rol de los componentes cognitivos involucrados en el deficit del funcionamiento pragmatico de pacientes con EM. Se realizara un estudio transversal correlacional, participaran 30 pacientes con EM remitente recurrente, se evaluara su desempeno en tareas de FE, HV y pragmatica utilizando la Bateria Neuropsicologica de Screening en Esclerosis Multiple y el Protocolo para la Evaluacion de la Comunicacion de Montreal. Los resultados de las dos evaluaciones se correlacionaran con el objetivo de identificar la relacion entre FE, HV y el componente de pragmatica para determinar si las alteraciones presentadas por los pacientes podrian estar permeadas por la funcion de otros dominios cognitivos.",

When the individuals of this group are carefully studied, other facts are discovered that are vastly more important than the injury. Indirectly, this is proved by the great number of people who have sustained severe injury and who present no late neurotic symptoms. On the other hand, a trifling physical injury with no concomitant shock may be followed by a most deplorable psychic state. In short, there must be some peculiarity of the individual that causes him to react in an uncommon way after a greater or lesser injury. This is borne out by an increasing experience with patients who have been so classified. When one is able to obtain an eminently satisfactory history from the patient, his early life, his",

      "title": "The diagnostic challenge",
      "abstract": "Abstract The onset of HD is insidious. Most clinicians refrain from making a diagnosis of either adult or juvenile onset HD until motor signs are present. The motor signs in JHD may differ from those seen in the classical adult form of the condition. Children and young people from HD families may present with behavioural or emotional problems, and a question of whether these are part of the onset of JHD or have an alternative explanation arises. Some families, in this circumstance, have described this as a distressing time as they perceive that professionals are not listening to their concerns, or are even blaming their parenting skills for their child's problems.A problem has arisen because the genetic test is sometimes described as 'diagnostic'. In fact the interpretation of the result depends on the clinical context in which the test was done. If unequivocal neurological abnormalities consistent with HD are present, then an abnormal result is seen as confirming a clinical diagnosis. If an abnormal test result is reported in an asymptomatic person, then the same genetic test is considered to be predictive. The problem comes when a child or young person has problems which may or may not be due to JHD. Unless the test results show an extremely large increase in CAG repeat length, an abnormal result will not resolve that difficulty.Clinicians need to continue to use the genetic test cautiously in children and young people with behavioural and emotional problems alone, but must also be sensitive to the negative perceptions that this may generate for the parent and other carers. At present additional clinical information may be obtained from standard imaging and neuropsychological assessments, and in the future analysis of other biomarkers currently in development may help in the assessment of this clinical problem.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Aims The diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia by pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome is essentially clinical. There are no pathognomonic criteria, but various clinical features can be suggestive of the diagnosis. We defined criteria that can help to the diagnosis. Materials and Methods A working party has validated a set of simple diagnostic criteria (Nantes criteria). Results The five essentials diagnostic criteria are: (1) Pain in the anatomical territory of the pudendal nerve. (2) Worsened by sitting. (3) The patient is not woken at night by the pain. (4) No objective sensory loss on clinical examination. (5) Positive anesthetic pudendal nerve block. Other clinical criteria can provide additional arguments in favor of the diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia. Exclusion criteria are also proposed: purely coccygeal, gluteal, or hypogastric pain, exclusively paroxysmal pain, exclusive pruritus, presence of imaging abnormalities able to explain the symptoms. Conclusion The diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia by pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome is essentially clinical. There are no specific clinical signs or complementary test results of this disease. However, a combination of criteria can be suggestive of the diagnosis. Neurourol. Urodynam. 27:306–310, 2008. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

      "title": "Measuring objective fatigability and autonomic dysfunction in clinical populations: How and why?",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is a major symptom in many diseases, often among the most common and severe ones and may last for an extremely long period. Chronic fatigue impacts quality of life, reduces the capacity to perform activities of daily living, and has socioeconomical consequences such as impairing return to work. Despite the high prevalence and deleterious consequences of fatigue, little is known about its etiology. Numerous causes have been proposed to explain chronic fatigue. They encompass psychosocial and behavioral aspects (e.g., sleep disorders) and biological (e.g., inflammation), hematological (e.g., anemia) as well as physiological origins. Among the potential causes of chronic fatigue is the role of altered acute fatigue resistance, i.e. an increased fatigability for a given exercise, that is related to physical deconditioning. For instance, we and others have recently evidenced that relationships between chronic fatigue and increased objective fatigability, defined as an abnormal deterioration of functional capacity (maximal force or power), provided objective fatigability is appropriately measured. Indeed, in most studies in the field of chronic diseases, objective fatigability is measured during single-joint, isometric exercises. While those studies are valuable from a fundamental science point of view, they do not allow to test the patients in ecological situations when the purpose is to search for a link with chronic fatigue. As a complementary measure to the evaluation of neuromuscular function (i.e., fatigability), studying the dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is also of great interest in the context of fatigue. The challenge of evaluating objective fatigability and ANS dysfunction appropriately (i.e.,. how?) will be discussed in the first part of the present article. New tools recently developed to measure objective fatigability and muscle function will be presented. In the second part of the paper, we will discuss the interest of measuring objective fatigability and ANS (i.e. why?). Despite the beneficial effects of physical activity in attenuating chronic fatigue have been demonstrated, a better evaluation of fatigue etiology will allow to personalize the training intervention. We believe this is key in order to account for the complex, multifactorial nature of chronic fatigue.",

Physiological, neurological, social, and mental well-being can be critically affected by insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Overall, health and quality of life can be impacted by sleep disorders. Mental health and sleep share a significant relationship. It has long been acknowledged that individuals with mental health disorders frequently experience sleep issues. The predominant theory has been that sleep issues are basically signs of the psychiatric disorders that they are interrelated with. The fact that sleep issues are defining characteristics of a number of psychiatric disorders and are included in the diagnostic criteria for these conditions supports this aspect. However, sleep and mental health problems are associated further in diverse ways. Emerging research evidence suggests that the relationship between mental health problems and sleep disorders is complex and includes bi-directional causation, in contrast to the long-held view of this relationship that considered sleep issues as symptoms of psychiatric disorders. An increased prevalence of mental/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among certain others, is reported among patients with insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and narcolepsy, suggesting sleep disorders as a risk factor for mental health disorders. Although much has been established about the relationship between impaired mental health and sleep, further research is required to elaborately comprehend this relationship. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the relationship between sleep disorders and mental health.",

      "abstract": "Certain psychiatric diseases have biological pathomechanisms, and as a result they are accompanied by various neurological symptoms. Neurological examination is a simple method to assess these symptoms. Neurological signs come in two varieties; they are either of the hard or the soft type. Hard symptoms appear primarily in organic psychiatric disorders or as side effects of psychiatric therapy. They can also be encountered during neurological diseases of psychiatric patients. Their use in diagnostics and therapy is widely accepted. In contrast, soft neurological symptoms often stay unnoticed, even though they may contain important pieces of information. For this reason they will form the focus of our discussion. Soft neurological symptoms have been studied in different psychiatric disorder-groups. Up to now most attention has been devoted to schizophrenia. The study suggests that the soft symptoms are trait markers of schizophrenia. Furthermore they also signal disease activity and predict the outcome of the disease. Neurological symptoms are also important pointers for psychiatry. However, more systematic studies may increase the theoretical and practical implications of soft symptoms.",

      "title": "PTSD, DEMENTIA, AND SLEEP DISORDER: A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: A recent article in this journal described three World War II veterans with cognitive impairment who presented with symptoms suggestive of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).1 The nature and type of dementia in these patients was not specified. Fluctuating cognition is one of the three major diagnostic criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Fluctuations are described as marked variation in a patient's cognitive or functional abilities or periods of confusion or decreased responsiveness alternating with reasonable lucidity. While identification of fluctuations is difficult, two of the reported patients had episodes of confusion and withdrawal suggestive of fluctuations. Other core features of DLB include recurrent visual hallucinations and spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism.2 The presence of any one criterion is required for a diagnosis of possible DLB, and two or more criteria are required to make a diagnosis of probable DLB. The clinical histories do not mention the presence of visual hallucinations or neuroleptic sensitivity, and the neurological examination was not reported in sufficient detail to ascertain whether these patients might have had features of parkinsonism. All three patients were diagnosed with depression before the onset of their symptoms. All also suffered from paranoid delusions. Delusions and other behavioral disturbances, while seen in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are not common presenting symptoms. Delusions are one of the supportive features of DLB. We have recently reported the validity of the proposed clinical criteria for DLB in our clinical-pathological series.3 We found that whereas delusions had high specificity (91%) in cases with mild to moderate dementia, it had low sensitivity in the diagnosis of DLB (38%). A combination of any three major or minor clinical criteria had the best predictive value (75%) in mild to moderate disease. A subjective disturbance of sleep, including the occurrence of repetitive, stereotypical anxiety dreams, is characteristic of PTSD.4-6 The phenomenology of the PTSD anxiety dream has seemed most consistent with an underlying rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dysfunction.4, 5 Whereas near total paralysis is characteristic of the REM phase of sleep, motor activity is common in the sleep disorder seen in PTSD.6 REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a recently described parasomnia characterized by excessive and elaborate motor activities during sleep and is associated with pathological absence of muscle atonia during REM sleep. The relationship between sleep disturbances in PTSD and RBD needs further research. However, the identification of RBD-like signs in PTSD, in previous cases as well as in this series, adds to the evidence for a fundamental disturbance of REM sleep mechanisms in PTSD.4-6 Other reports have described patients with RBD presenting with or subsequently developing cognitive impairment.7, 8 Most of these patients also meet criteria for possible or probable DLB. The pattern of cognitive differences from AD in these patients with RBD and dementia is similar to reported comparisons between DLB and AD. A recent international workshop on criteria for DLB has recommended including depression and RBD as additional supportive features for the diagnosis of DLB.9 The clinical features in these patients suggest a diagnosis of possible or probable DLB. The clinical descriptions do not have features typical of other common types of dementia, such as AD or vascular dementia. It is possible that in some patients PSTD and/or RBD may either herald or present with cognitive impairment, which may subsequently evolve into DLB. Further studies with longitudinal assessments will be required to address this issue. Additional investigations utilizing as polysomnography, sleep questionnaires, and detailed neuropsychological assessments may also help in this regard. The finding of a specific disturbance of sleep unique to PTSD has significant therapeutic implications and also contributes to a better understanding of the nature of the dementia associated with the cases reported.

Certain difficulties, however, at once present themselves; first, owing to the relatively nondestructive character of the pathologic process, no just parallel can be drawn between its apparent extent and the resultant signs and symptoms; in the second place, exact and painstaking correlations of lesions and symptoms have rarely been attempted in the now large number of clinically observed cases with subsequent necropsy. Most writers have been content with general statements regarding pathologic findings as explanatory of symptoms, as, for example, numerous cortical areas of sclerosis, or many sclerotic patches in the pons or oblongata or the cord showing plaques in both sensory and motor tracts. The reason for this apparent inaccuracy is sufficiently obvious.",

Jednymi z najczęściej zgłaszanych przez pacjentów skarg, zwłaszcza w początkowym okresie realimentacji, są dolegliwości ze strony przewodu pokarmowego. Najczęściej objawy te są powiązane z zaburzeniami motoryki przewodu pokarmowego. Z dostępnych danych wynika, że aż połowa pacjentów chorujących na jadłowstręt psychiczny cierpi na istotne zaburzenia motoryki przewodu pokarmowego (niepełna relaksacja górnego i dolnego zwieracza przełyku, zaburzona podatność żołądka, opóźnione opróżnianie żołądka, wydłużenie pasażu jelitowego, osłabienie motoryki odbytnicy i odbytu).

Brak odniesienia wyników badań naukowych do praktyki klinicznej, oraz brak standardów postępowania co do diagnostyki i leczenia zaburzeń przewodu pokarmowego u chorych na jadłowstręt psychiczny stanowi duży problem zarówno dla specjalistów w dziedzinie psychiatrii jak i gastroenterologii.",

The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

      "abstract": "Childhood Cerebral Palsy – the group of diseases concerned with motor disorders as the result of brain damage or dysfunction of certain brain centers – is usually acquired during the first years of life, at the time when the system of primary movement patterns is developing. Primary movements are genetically programmed for protection and survival, and also for the development of the conscious movement system. Developmentally their role is to support: - maturation of the nervous system (synaptogenesis, myelination, and brain plasticity) - brain function (cognitive development, emotional maturation) - sensory-motor integration. Dysfunctions of motor development and sensory-motor integration in the child with CP are a reflection of the type of neurological insult and the developmental stage of the infant/child when the neurological insult occurred. The developmental stages can be divided into prenatal (in utero); natal (during the birth process); or postnatal (after birth but during the first years of life). Each developmental stage is vulnerable to specific neurological insults. Prenatal palsy can be caused by infection, toxicity in the fetus, or compromised health in the pregnant mother. Some primary motor patterns and reflexes, such as Trunk Extension, Automatic Gait, Grasp, Swallowing and Sucking develop in utero. Prenatal brain damage will cause poor expression of these reflexes and adversely impact the next stage of development. Natal palsy is generally caused by neurological insult during birth: a consequence of premature birth, sudden deliveries, narrow pelvis of the mother, use of forceps during birth, etc. Natal trauma can negatively affect the activation of primary motor patterns and reflexes characteristic of a normal successful birth. In such cases the expression of these genetic programs will be abnormal. The primary movements and reflexes of childbirth, such as Head Righting, Perez, Tonic Labyrinthine (TLR) in extension, Bauer Crawling, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning, and Sucking may be dysfunctional. Postnatal palsy is often caused by an infection with encephalitic symptoms. Other causes include childhood cranial injury, central nervous system injury, and poor systemic health. Infant motor patterns and reflexes will be stressed by postnatal CP, and may develop dysfunctionally or pathologically. Dynamic reflexes (e.g., Grasp, Hands Pulling, Automatic Gait, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning); positional reflexes (e.g., Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [ATNR] Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [STNR], Babkin Palmomental, Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex",

La douleur non exprimée ne joue plus son rôle d’alerte à la menace vitale et contribue à l’augmentation de la mortalité liée à des pathologies somatiques dans ces populations dites vulnérables, notamment chez les adultes avec TSA [1,4], chez qui la prescription de psychotropes compliquent les mesures d’hétéro-évaluations classiques. Certaines études expérimentales ont montrés que ces groupes de patients présentent des particularités nociceptives avec des seuils à la nociception augmentés ou des réactions paradoxales, mais les résultats sont contradictoires [2]. Les causes de ces phénomènes sont mal comprises. Une atteinte des structures cérébrales impliquées dans l’intégration émotionnelle de la douleur (cortex préfrontal), une augmentation de l’activité opiacée, une dissociation paradoxale entre la réponse comportementale et les réactions neurovégétatives, des possibles anomalies des mécanismes excitateurs responsables de la sommation temporelle, ont contrebalancé les hypothèses plus psychopathologiques de troubles de l’expression de la douleur dans cette condition pathologiques développementales [1,3]. En effet, au-delà de l’atteinte des processus cognitifs, les troubles de la communication chez les personnes avec TSA sont à ce jour considérés comme la principale cible des interventions à mener dans les cadres psycho-éducatifs et thérapeutiques afin de mieux prévenir et dépister la douleur chez ces patients hautement vulnérables. Car si communiquer diminue la douleur, la douleur diminue, elle les capacités de communication déjà altérées dans ces troubles, d’où l’enjeu essentiel des stratégies d’aides à la communication ou communication augmentée, qui ne peuvent plus être considérées en 2014 comme un « si besoin… ».",

This can also be the case for general medical conditions for both aetiology and differences in structure or process and sometimes lack of useful biomarkers but this occurs to a lesser extent. There are also occasions when medical conditions cause mental health problems directly. For this reason doctors will always be involved in mental health to some degree and will use diagnostic constructs to describe these conditions as they are familiar with diagnosis in their medical practice. There are examples of clear biological abnormalities that are often detected accidentally that do not require treatment. Medically unexplained or functional symptoms/syndromes are commonly seen in general medicine, although the term ‘medically unexplained’ is contentious.

It is more difficult to offer a comprehensive clinical definition of epileptic seizures and epilepsy because of the varied clinical manifestations produced by cerebral neuronal discharge. However, an epileptic seizure can be defined as an intermittent and stereotyped disturbance of consciousness, behaviour, emotion, motor function, or sensation that on clinical grounds is believed to result from cortical neuronal discharge. Epilepsy can then be defined as a condition in which seizures recur, usually spontaneously. The differential diagnosis of epilepsy is large because of the enormous range of symptoms that can occur during seizures. Inevitably, the differential diagnosis for tonic-clonic seizures is very different from that for simple partial seizures with autonomic symptoms. The most common clinical problem is the differential diagnosis from other causes of transient loss of consciousness associated with collapse, the commonest cause of which is syncope.",

The symptomatology and etiology of HS remain unclear, but, in the cases of pure HS, the usual clinical diagnosis was AD. It is suggested that HS could explain unusual association of an amnestic syndrome with fronto-temporal dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies. Moreover, it could also be responsible of amnestic disorders similar to those found in AD, but remaining isolated during many years. Epilepsy or anoxia, the main causes of HS, are rarely found in the history of demented people with HS. Therefore, HS might be due to a degenerative process close to dementias lacking histologic features.

Traditional psychosomatic models had less predictive value and less therapeutic importance than what was hoped for. The main problem with these models was the lack of a pathophysiological explanation for why psychological problems could be related to somatic disease. Sustained arousal or \"allostatic load\" offers more plausible and acceptable mechanisms for pathology, and, to some extent, for sensitization and illness. The combination of cognitive psychology and neurophysiology offers a model for somatic pathology, and, perhaps more important, also for the understanding of subjective complaints and illness.",

Diese ‚psychosomatischen‘ Komorbiditäten nehmen mit der Migräneschwere weiter zu. Schwer betroffene, komorbide Patienten haben oft auch ein schlechteres Ansprechen auf die spezifische Migränetherapie. Interessanterweise haben die Migräne und die genannten Komorbiditäten zahlreiche gemeinsame ätiologische oder begünstigende Faktoren, z.B. genetische Faktoren, das häufigere Vorkommen bei Frauen und bei Menschen mit traumatischen Vorerfahrungen, sowie (bei Schmerzsyndromen) Zeichen einer zentralen Sensibilisierung. Eine weitere Gemeinsamkeit ist der Zusammenhang mit aktuellem oder chronischem Stresserleben. Wir schlagen ein erweitertes Diathese-Stress-Modell vor, das zusammenhängende, aber doch individuell unterschiedliche Vulnerabilitäten berücksichtigt und, abhängig vom Stresserleben, sowohl das Auftreten einzelner Erkrankungen (z.B. einer isolierten Migräne) als auch das gemeinsame Auftreten der Migräne mit anderen Schmerzsyndromen und weiteren psychosomatischen Komorbiditäten abbilden kann.

It was found that the closest relationship between the level of post-traumatic stress and psychopathological symptoms (anxiety, somatisation, interpersonal sensitivity, etc.) is observed in the case of delayed experience of a dangerous disease, which allows us to consider it as a special existential situation.",

      "abstract": "The sense of personal identity is an element of the Jasperian definition of self-conscience. Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "abstract": "Depression is among the most frequent psychiatric comorbid conditions in dementia. There is no strong consensus as to what criteria should be used to diagnose depression in AD. This is at least partially explained by the overlap between symptoms of depression and symptoms of AD. Recent studies using latent class analysis provided clarification to this diagnostic dilemma. All nine DSM-IV symptoms of major depression were found to characterize a class with a high chance (96%) of having a clinical diagnosis of major depression, and symptoms of anxiety were also frequent. Other psychiatric symptoms may also be included under the construct of depression in AD, since both apathy and anxiety are among the most frequent comorbid conditions for major depression in AD. Subtypes of depression should also be validated in this condition. For instance, increased awareness of cognitive and functional deficits is significantly associated with dysthymia but not with major depression, suggesting that different depressive syndromes in AD may have different etiology.",

Underneath the umbrella of these common symptoms many invisible, unpredictable and erratic symptoms persists which complicates both the clinical presentation and the treatment. As majority of these symptoms are subjective so their true assessment on objective ground is difficult. It is important to consider that patients with MS and their care-takers should have reasonable knowledge about these symptoms because if these symptoms go unidentified or untreated then they may lead to a difficult diagnostic dilemma hence complicates further management. The frequency and severity of these unusual symptoms at times raise a suspicion of other neurological diseases. The occurrence of any of these symptoms at times may be a sign of active disease.",

      "abstract": "Any symptom represents a perception of an abnormal internal body state. The threshold for perceiving the internal body state as abnormal varies and depends particularly on psychological influences. As a result, a symptom can either reflect pathology, whether serious or not, or be generated wholly psychologically. Intuition allowing discrimination between these possibilities is central to the physician9s art. Particular difficulty arises in differentiating between those psychologically generated symptoms which are produced unconsciously, often as a result of anxiety or depression, and those that constitute deliberate deception. Such malingering has the unstated intent of accessing a secondary gain, such as welfare benefit. The art of diagnosis includes estimation of whether symptoms resonate with known pathophysiological processes, using history-taking as a story which unfolds logically towards a diagnosis, assessing how a patient reacts to their symptoms compared to neutral matters, detecting exaggeration or falsification, and documenting evidence of psychologically generated abnormalities during examination. Scientific ability is only one of the attributes of a good diagnostician; equally important are abilities to notice things, to weigh up human nature and to recognise dilemmas. Our procedures for selecting medical students and physicians need to assess these skills as well as scientific qualifications.",

Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death.

      "title": "Chronic Pain with Neuropathic Characteristic",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain conditions are often categorised into two major groups, namely nociceptive (caused by tissue damage) or neuropathic (caused by nerve damage) pain. In the past few years, this dichotomous approach (either neuropathic or nociceptive) has been questioned and it has been suggested that not only “typical” neuropathic pain syndromes but also otherwise chronic pain (e.g. back pain) may have neuropathic components of pain. This dimensional perspective is consistent with basic scientific opinion regarding chronic pain mechanisms; however, further studies are needed to examine it empirically. Neuropathic symptoms (e.g. burning and prickling sensations) have a central role in the clinical diagnosis of the neuropathic components of pain. The main aim of the first study was to assess the severity of self-reported neuropathic symptoms in different syndromes of chronic pain (e.g. headache, musculoskeletal pain, postsurgical pain). Using validated screening tools for neuropathic symptoms, a number of recent populationbased studies reported higher levels of pain intensity, as well as anxiety and depressive symptoms, in respondents who scored high on neuropathic symptoms, compared to those who scored low. Consequently, many authors have suggested the assumption of the uniqueness of neuropathic pain quality in its intensity and distressing characteristic. We aimed to further examine the association of the severity of neuropathic symptoms with pain-related (e.g. pain intensity and chronicity) and psychological factors (e.g. depression) in clinical samples of patients: one sample of patients with diverse types of chronic pain (study 1), and 4 samples of patients with typical neuropathic pain, radiculopathy, fibromyalgia or nociceptive back pain (study 2). In study 2, we also compared different patterns of neuropathic symptoms regarding pain and psychological factors. Seven hundred and six (study 1: n=400; study 2: n=306) patients suffering from a chronic pain condition enrolled for multidisciplinary pain treatment were considered for inclusion in the research project. The criteria for inclusion were: an age of over 18 years and having chronic pain according to ICD-10 criteria (F45.41 or R52.1-2). In study 2 only patients with typical neuropathic pain, back pain with (radiculopathy) or without (nociceptive back pain) clinical signs of nerve involvement, and fibromyalgia were included. The pain DETECT questionnaire was used to assess the severity of neuropathic symptoms in patients. A high severity of neuropathic symptoms was found not only in “typical neuropathic pain” but also in fibromyalgia and postsurgical pain (study 1). At first sight, our findings in a sample of patients with diverse types of chronic pain (study 1) suggested that neuropathic symptoms are associated with a high level of pain intensity, pain chronicity, functional disability and depression. However, in study 2 considering patients who had been diagnosed with typical neuropathic pain, radiculopathy or fibromyalgia, neither severity nor different patterns of neuropathic symptoms were correlated with the pain-related and psychological variables. A subgroup of nociceptive back pain patients who scored high on selfreported neuropathic symptoms reported high levels of pain intensity, depression, catastrophising and non-acceptance of pain suggesting a general response tendency (response bias) in this subgroup of nociceptive back pain patients. In summary, the results corroborate and support a dimensional perspective of neuropathic pain. Our findings lend no support to the assumption of many authors that a high severity of neuropathic symptoms principally results in high levels of pain intensity and psychological distress as it is not the case in patients with an underlying pathology of neuropathic symptoms. The results highlight the influence of cognitive-emotional factors on the experience and report of pain. The implications of these findings for research and clinical practice are discussed.",

It is first noticed and reported by the patient’s care takers. The clinicians objectively assess the type and degree of the memory loss by a specific battery of tests, specially designed for the purpose (like Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test., Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE etc.)). Understanding the symptoms of AD, arising out of memory loss, requires deeper insights into what initiates the memory (the sensory inputs from the five sense organs), the different types of memories (explicit, implicit memories, their sub types and associative memory etc.), how the memory signals are modified at the level of the neuron, (analog to digital signals) and the synapse (sensitization, habituation and Long term potentiation / depression etc.), the processing that the inputs received , undergo (encoding, consolidation /organization, storage and retrieval) in higher brain centres (amygdala, hippocampus prefrontal vortex etc.) and also the role played by the various receptors (NMDA, AMPA and the kinase receptors), the neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, Norepineprine, Gama aminobutic acid, serotonin etc.), the central network systems involved (central executive network, salience network, and the default mode network). In short, it is the study all about, of the physiology of memory. The next step is to integrate this knowledge to interpret symptoms of patients with AD. Accordingly, the subject under discussion is dealt with in two parts. Firstly, how the memory is affected in AD and secondly the physiology behind these changes.",

Achalasia of the cardia, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and non-Hirschsprung megacolon are well-known examples of damage to the bowel nerve supply. There are many causes, some of which are unknown, but the common ones can be divided into three groups. Congenital developmental failure may be total and incompatible with life, or less severe, in which case resection may be possible. Acquired inflammatory damage, other than Chagas' disease, can occur anywhere in the gut. Autonomic neuropathy may involve either the neurons or the Schwann cells. The former is often due to drugs because the autonomic ganglia are outside the blood-brain barrier. The latter is frequently associated with metabolic disease, such as diabetes mellitus.",

The disorders associated with behaviors while asleep (parasomnias) are: sleep terrors and sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder. Injury can result from behaviors that occur during sleep. The patient's ability to recall the episode depends partly on the type of the parasomnia (occurrence during non-REM versus REM sleep). The other sleep disorders are recurrent hypersomnia and insomnia. Insomnia can result from multiple causes including psychiatric or general medical disorders, medication effects, substance abuse, and other sleep disorders. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is another important cause of insomnia. RLS is thought to be related to periodic limb movement disorder and is characterized by lower extremity dysesthesias that occur at rest.",

      "title": "[Causes, diagnosis and treatment of neurogenic dysphagia as an interdisciplinary clinical problem].",
      "abstract": "The intricate mechanism of swallowing can be divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Dysphagia is a disruption in the swallowing process, which include difficulty in transporting (or a lack of transporting) a food or liquid bolus from the mouth through the pharynx and esophagus into the stomach. Causes of disruptions in the swallowing process can be divided into superior (oropharyngeal) and inferior (esophageal) according to Paradowski et al. Neurlologic dysphagia may be caused by a disruption in different parts of the central nervous system (supranuclear level, level of motor and sensory nuclei taking part in swallowing process, peripherial nerves level and a pathology of muscle cells and spindles) or neuromuscular and muscular disorders. Neuromuscular disorders causes according to Waśko-Czopnik et al. are: stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, bulbar and pseudobulbar paralysis, neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis), tabes dorsalis, multisystem degenerations, Parkinson's disease, delayed dyskineses, Huntington's disease, myasthenia and myasthenic syndromes, myopathies and peripherial neuropathies. The correct diagnosis evaluation include history taking, physical examination with palpation and consultations (laryngological, gastrological and neurological). According to Halama radiological esophagogram, videofluoroscopy, flexible endoscopic examination, ultrasound examination, manometry, electromyography, scintigraphy and 24 hour pH monitoring are main diagnostic procedures of dysphagia. Some of the reasons for the neurologic dysphagia may be treated by surgical and pharmacological methods. Neurologic dysphagia rehabilitation is difficult, long-lasting and often falling far short of expected results. Primary it should include neurologic cause treatment if it is possible. According to WHO International Classification of Functioning and Health in 2001 non-invasive methods of dysphagia treatment may be divided into reconstitution, compensatory and adaptive techniques. The most popular reconstitution methods are thermal stimulation (Lazzar's) or tactilethermal application (Rosenbeck's) techniques which may be applied for abnormal duration of stage transition (DST). Abnormal duration of stage transition considerably increase probability of aspiration. Dysphagia treatment by compensatory methods consist in various techniques of swallowing and posture changes application. Adaptive techniques include dietary changes--avoiding of sustenances strengthening dysphagia and adequate dietary intake. The basic principle of dysphagia rehabilitation is that the most effective way to regain efficiency is the regeneration on remains of lost function. Carrying out imperfect swallowing acts is probably the best way of increasing effectiveness and efficiency of swallowing. On the other hand imperfect swallowing acts may be hazardous because of the danger of aspiration and inhalation pneumonia.",

A similar procedure should occur in the psychiatric evaluation of, say, a patient with depression, first looking for secondary causes, such as Cushing's syndrome, before considering a diagnosis of one of the idiopathic causes, shch as major depressive disorder.

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "abstract": "Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS), which is characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and tendon areflexia, is generally considered as a clinical variant of Guillain-Barré Syndrome. However some features of the disease are still debated, particularly regarding possible central nervous system involvement. After presenting two new cases of MFS, the authors provide a critical review of the literature and discuss the nosographical position of the disease. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: MFS is a predominantly axonal inflammatory neuropathy with prevailing involvement of oculomotor nerves. It is associated to spinal multi or polyneuropathy, which in mildly affected cases is manifested by areflexia, while in severe ones it can be responsible of sense and/or motor impairment. In addition to peripheral neuropathy CNS involvement, exclusive or more marked in posterior fossa, occurs not infrequently. The prognosis of the disease is often benign, but disabling or even fatal outcome is possible. Corticosteroid treatment, possibly because of antiinflammatory and/or immunosuppressive action, could be effective in some patients. Finally, in spite of some similarities with GBS, MFS should be considered as a separate entity with its own nosographical position.",

However, other problems reflect philosophical positions ranging from those based on the premise that primary depression does not fit the medical model and therefore is not a \"disease\" that can be modeled, to those holding that the emotional state of depression is so uniquely human that subhuman organisms cannot be used in its analysis. In evaluating animal models of any human disorder or condition, it is crucial for those using the models to keep abreast of developments and advances in the relevant clinical knowledge concerning the particular condition being studied. This is especially important for such disorders as essential hypertension or major depression where the central causative factors are not yet known, but where extensive clinical investigation is constantly expanding knowledge of the patients' condition.",

The goals of acute treatment are reversal of neurological disability sustained from an attack, arrest of rapidly deteriorating neurological dysfunction, and restoration of function.

Em geral, a primeira manifestacao clinica e a deficiencia da memoria recente, alem das dificuldades de atencao e fluencia verbal, outras funcoes cognitivas passam a ser comprometidas a medida que a patologia evolui. Observa-se em exames de neuroimagem e na autopsia que ha atrofia das regioes corticais, especialmente na parte medial do lobo temporal e nas areas de associacao dos lobos frontal e parietal. O peso do encefalo em exame de autopsia apresenta uma reducao cerca de 15 a 35%. No exame microscopio o tecido nervoso apresenta sinais do envelhecimento normal, mas com intensidade mais evoluida que o esperado. Registra-se reducao do numero de neuronios, das ramificacoes dendriticas e das sinapses, alem da formacao de placas senis e emaranhados neurofibriliares. No entanto, com o passar dos anos e da ciencia se fez necessario o aprimoramento e novos avancos na pesquisa da doenca de Alzheimer o que acarretou uma mudanca em sua compreensao. Nos criterios de 1984 obrigatoriamente, era necessario ocorrer sintomas de esquecimentos graves, alem de possuir tambem os sintomas anatomopatologico para realizar o diagnostico. Nos novos criterios, concluiu-se que nao e preciso esquecimentos desde leves a graves para realizar o diagnostico. Alem disso, naquela epoca os estudos em genetica nao eram tao atualizados quanto sao agora, alem dessas mudancas, as novas diretrizes passaram a reconhecer que o inicio das lesoes neuropatologicas ocorre anos ou decadas antes dos primeiros sintomas. A faixa etaria normalmente afetada por essa doenca aumentou, agora se reconhece pacientes com menos de 40 anos e maiores de 90 de idade. Agora a definicao determina que o paciente deva apresentar dois dos seguintes dominios acometidos: declinio da memoria, do raciocinio, do manejo de tarefas complexas, do julgamento, da comunicacao e alteracoes na personalidade e comportamento, sem a obrigacao de um deles ser deficiencia de memoria. O estudo trata-se de demonstrar a maneira como era e como e atualmente diagnosticada a doenca de Alzheimer. Trata-se de uma revisao bibliografica com artigos publicados no banco de dados do Pubmed e do Scielo. Foi observado que a quantidade de artigos voltados para o diagnostico do Alzheimer ainda e precaria, pois as grandes maiorias dos hospitais brasileiros ainda utilizam os metodos antigos para a deteccao, se faz necessario uma atualizacao dos servicos e pesquisa.",

One of the common referral queries to clinicians of people with ID – ‘Is this a mental illness or just a problem behaviour?’ – tends to stir up more discussion. At one extreme, attempts to understand maladaptive behaviours are merely descriptive and simply default to the ID itself. For example, aggression or self-injurious behaviour is said to be a product of the individual's cognitive disability and does not warrant a ‘diagnosis’. At the same time, the degree to which an individual is held accountable for his behaviour is also placed into consideration, as is the appropriateness of pharmacotherapy, depending on the answer to the referral question.",

      "abstract": "Despite substantial research focusing on the interaction between sleep and cognition, especially memory, the impact of sleep and sleep loss on affective and emotional regulation has comparatively attracted much less attention. This might be surprising considering that nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired mood express co-occurring abnormalities of sleep, and that many sleep disorders are accompanied by mood disturbances, thus suggesting an intimate relationship between sleep and emotion. Yet, recent studies evaluating subjective as well as objective measures of mood and affect, combined with insights from clinical observations and neuroimaging research, offer new evidence for the emerging role of sleep in regulating emotional brain function. In this chapter, we review clinical and neuroimaging data that support the existence of such complex interactions between sleep and emotion regulation. We report that (1) sleep disorders are frequently associated with affective symptoms; (2) patients with mood disorders often present with sleep disturbances; (3) sleep deprivation may transitorily alleviate depressive symptoms; (4) dream experiences may be highly emotional; (5) brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation, such as the limbic (e.g., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex) and ventromedial prefrontal regions, are strongly activated during REM sleep; (6) subjective mood assessments exhibit a circadian modulation. New data also show that some hypothalamic neuropeptides (hypocretin/orexin) play a dual role in the stabilization of sleep–wake states and on mesolimbic dopamine activity, with significant effects on neural plasticity related to emotional learning, reward processing, and addiction. Together, these seemingly disparate observations converge to indicate a physiological interplay between sleep–wake and emotional brain functions serving the modulation, the preparation, and the optimization of waking behavior.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

      "abstract": "#### Summary points\n\nNeuropathic pain arises from damage, or pathological change, in the peripheral or central nervous system. It is usually a chronic condition that can be difficult to treat because standard treatment with conventional analgesics does not typically provide effective relief of pain. Patients with neuropathic pain commonly present to primary care professionals, but making a diagnosis may be difficult. Neuropathic pain is usually associated with substantially greater impairment of quality of life compared with other types of chronic pain, and the disorder is a large cost burden on healthcare services. In this review, we provide an overview of published evidence to help clinicians recognise and manage patients with neuropathic pain.\n\nA group of specialists of the International Association for the Study of Pain defines neuropathic pain as “pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.”1 In contrast to inflammatory or nociceptive pain, which is caused by actual tissue damage or potentially tissue damaging stimuli, neuropathic pain is produced either by damage to, or pathological change in, the peripheral or central nervous system, the system that normally signals pain. As such, the term neuropathic pain represents a varying set of symptoms rather than a single diagnosis.\n\nDamage to the somatosensory system can provoke a range of responses; an absence of sensation and pain is probably a more common response than new onset of …",

Seizures (altered brain wave [electrophysiological] patterns) present clinically as abnormal consciousness with or without tonic/clonic convulsions (where \"tonic\" = stiffening and \"clonic\" = involuntary rhythmical movements). Neuropathological findings following seizures may be detected using many methods. Neuro-imaging may show a structural abnormality underlying seizures, such as focal cortical dysplasia or hippocampal sclerosis in patients with chronic epilepsy. Neural cell type-specific biomarkers in blood or cerebrospinal fluid may highlight neuronal damage and/or glial reactions but are not specific indicators of seizures while serum electrolyte and glucose imbalances may induce seizures. Gross observations and brain weights generally are unaffected by TAs with seizurogenic potential, but microscopic evaluation may reveal seizure-related neuron death in some brain regions (especially neocortex, hippocampus, and/or cerebellum). Current globally accepted best practices for neural sampling in nonclinical general toxicity studies provide a suitable screen for brain regions that are known sites of electrical disruption and/or display seizure-induced neural damage. Conventional nonclinical studies can afford an indication that a TA has a potential seizure liability (via in-life signs and/or microscopic evidence of neuron necrosis), but confirmation requires measuring brain electrical (electroencephalographic) activity in a nonclinical study.",

      "abstract": "Objectives \"Epileptic dementia\" is reported in adults with childhood-onset refractory epilepsy. Cognitive deterioration can also occur in a \"second-hit model\". Materials and methods We studied the clinical and neuropsychological characteristics of patients with cognitive deterioration (≥1 SD discrepancy between current IQ and premorbid IQ). Memory function, reaction time and processing speed were also evaluated. Analyses were performed to investigate which clinical characteristics correlated with cognitive deterioration. Results Twenty-seven patients were included with a mean age of 55.7 years old, an average age at epilepsy onset of 33.9 years and a mean duration of 21.8 years. Over 40% had experienced at least one status epilepticus. About 77.8% had at least one comorbid disease (most of (cardio)vascular origin). Cognitive deterioration scores were significant for both Performance IQ and Full Scale IQ, but not for Verbal IQ. Impairments in fluid functions primarily affected the IQ-scores. Memory was not impaired. Epilepsy factors explained 7% of the variance in deterioration, whereas 38% was explained by relatively low premorbid IQ and educational level, high age at seizure onset and older age. Conclusions A subgroup of patients with localization-related epilepsy exhibits cognitive decline characterized by deterioration in PIQ and FSIQ, but with preserved higher order functions (VIQ and memory). Patients typically have epilepsia tarda, comorbid pathology, relatively low educational level and older age. These are factors known to increase the vulnerability of the brain by diminishing cognitive reserve. Cognitive deterioration may develop according to a stepwise \"second-hit model\", affecting and accelerating the cognitive ageing process.",

La ceguera, diplopia o paralisis de la mirada son los signos neuroftalmologicos mas frecuentes en el trastorno conversivo. Describimos el caso de un nino con ptosis como manifestacion de un trastorno conversivo. Metodo y resultados: Varon de 9 anos en estudio por ptosis unilateral izquierda de inicio brusco, sin antecedentes medicos relevantes. En la exploracion se aprecia ptosis de ceja y palpebral izquierda, sin alteraciones de la motilidad ocular intrinseca ni extrinseca. Dado que la exploracion no se justifica por patologia de ningun par craneal, se sospecha ptosis miogenica y se solicita estudio. Las pruebas complementarias, tales como analitica autoinmune, test de estimulacion repetitiva, etc. fueron negativas. Tras descartar patologia organica y conocer situacion emocional inestable por separacion de sus padres, es valorado por el servicio de psiquiatria con diagnostico de trastorno conversivo. Conclusion: La ptosis es una rara manifestacion del trastorno conversivo, y aun mas en la infancia. Solo hemos encontrado dos casos descritos en la literatura. Es importante descartar patologia organica, diferenciar esta patologia de la simulacion y conocerla para incluirla en el diagnostico diferencial de la ptosis. EnglishPurpose: Conversion disorder is defined by DSM-IV as a deficit of sensory or motor function that cannot be explained by a medical condition and where psychological factors are judged to be associated with the deficit because symptoms are preceded by conflicts or other stressors. Blindness, diplopia or paralysis of the gaze are the most frequent neurophthalmological signs in the conversion disorder. We describe the case of a child with ptosis as a manifestation of a conversion disorder. Method and results: A 9-year-old male with abrupt left unilateral ptosis, without relevant medical history. On exploration, present left eyebrow and palpebral ptosis, without intrinsic or extrinsic ocular motility alterations. Since the examination is not justified by pathology of any cranial nerve pair, myogenic ptosis is suspected and study. Complementary tests were negative (autoimmune analytics, repetitive stimulation test, etc.). After ruling out organic pathology and knowing unstable emotional situation by separation from their parents, it is valued by the psychiatry service with a diagnosis of conversion disorder. Conclusion: Ptosis is a rare manifestation of the conversion disorder, and even more so in childhood. We have only found two cases in the literature. It is important to rule out organic pathology, differentiate this pathology from the simulation and know it to include in the differential diagnosis of ptosis.",

      "title": "Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome Complicating Mitochondrial Encephalopathy",
      "abstract": "The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a rare cause of upper intestinal obstruction. It results from a compression by the SMA of the third portion of the duodenum against the aorta (1). Precipitating factors include a prolonged supine position, severe lumbar lordosis, and a marked loss of weight with a subsequent loss of mesenteric and retroperitoneal fat (2). Mitochondrial encephalopathy encompasses a group of disorders characterized by morphologic, biochemical, or molecular evidence of abnormal mitochondrial function, with multiple organ involvements. They include several, usually distinct, clinical syndromes-e.g., Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Leigh disease, mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE), myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)(3,4). Some patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy have symptoms of gastrointestinal involvement. Episodic vomiting is one of the well-known symptoms in MELAS, Leigh disease, and MNGIE(3,5). No previous reports of SMA syndrome associated with severe weight loss related to mitochondrial encephalopathy have been published. We present the first such case and discuss the predisposition to this syndrome in children with metabolic diseases, characterized by recurrent vomiting and severe weight loss. CASE REPORT The patient, a 15-year-old boy, was referred to our hospital because of severe vomiting and weight loss. His early medical history was uneventful. He had been born at term and weighed 3,200 g. There were no perinatal abnormalities. Mental and physical development were normal in early childhood. However, at age 7, he began to have unilateral seizures with ocular deviation, for which he received anticonvulsant drugs. His development had been retarded since then. Computed tomographic scan of the brain, performed when he was 8 years old, revealed bilateral calcification of the basal ganglia. Abnormal Q waves were observed on the electrocardiogram, and there was dilated cardiomyopathy. Funduscopic examinations showed generalized pigmentary retinopathy without ophthalmoplegia. At the age of 8, the patient's blood concentration of lactate was 2.01 mmol/l (normal, 1.00-1.78 mmol/l), and the level of pyruvate was 0.102 mmol/l(normal, 0.034-0.068 mmol/l). The cerebrospinal fluid level of lactate was elevated to 4.74 mmol/l (upper limit, 2.22 mmol/l); that of pyruvate was 0.181 mmol/l (upper limit, 0.227 mmol/l). The lactate-pyruvate ratio was 19.7 in peripheral blood (upper limit, 20) and 26.9 in cerebrospinal fluid (upper limit, 25), respectively. An open muscle biopsy sample was obtained from the left rectus femoris. Modified Gomori's trichrome staining showed ragged red fibers with no other abnormalities. Enzyme activities of rotenone-sensitive NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I), succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex II), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III), cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase(complex V) were measured in accordance with previously reported methods(6). The enzyme activity of complex I of the patient's mitochondria was within normal range, whereas the enzyme activities of complexes II, III, IV, and V of the mitochondria were several times higher than normal values. These high levels of enzyme activities are attributable to the increased number of mitochondria in the tissue, appearing as ragged red fibers. Because all subunits of complex II are encoded by nuclear genes, whereas some of the subunits of complexes I, III, IV, and V are encoded by mitochondrial genes, it seems reasonable to compare the ratios of the activities of other complexes with those of the activity of complex II. Complex I activity, relative to complex II activity in the mitochondria, was markedly lower (19%) than that in normal control subjects(Table). Subunits of complex I, III, IV, and V were analyzed by Western blotting with specific antibodies, according to the method of Tanaka et al(7). Results of immunoblot analysis of the subunits are shown in Figure 1. The amounts of subunits of complex III, IV, and V in the mitochondria markedly increased. However, the amounts of complex I subunits were almost normal. Similar disproportionate deficiency of respiratory enzymes has been reported in other patients with mitochondrial diseases (8-10). These laboratory values established the diagnosis of a relatively deficient complex I. Mitochondrial DNA analysis (11) was performed to detect point mutations that have been described in association with MELAS, MERRF, and Leigh disease. Results of the analysis were normal at the following nucleotide positions: nt 3243, nt 3252, and nt 3271 in tRNA for leucine in MELAS; nt 8344 and nt 8356 in tRNA for lysine in MERRF; nt 8993 in the gene for subunit 6 of ATPase in Leigh disease. Episodic attacks of vomiting occurred, with and without overexertion and stress, and the patient required fluid supplementation for dehydration. When he was 15 years old, he consulted a local physician for recurrent vomiting, weight loss, and symptoms of ileus. His condition deteriorated, and he was referred to our hospital for complete examination and treatment. On admission, he was 142.7 cm tall and weighed 27.4 kg, approximately 68% of his ideal weight for height. His skin was dry, with a decrease in turgor. There was severe abdominal distension with a decrease in bowel sounds. Neurologic examination showed bilateral pyramidal signs. An abdominal radiograph showed a double-bubble sign, with diminished gas shadows in the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract. An upper gastrointestinal series was performed, using barium introduced through a nasogastric tube. We observed an abrupt termination of the contrast-filled column in the horizontal portion of the duodenum, with dilatation of the first and second portions of the duodenum and antiperistaltic flow of the contrast medium (Fig. 2). These results led to a definitive diagnosis of SMA syndrome. The patient was treated conservatively. After the gastric contents were aspirated, a nasoduodenal tube was passed beyond the site of the obstruction into the paroximal jejunum, which led to a cessation of vomiting. Initial enteral feeding of 720 kcal/day by nasoduodenal tube, which was increased gradually to 1,500 kcal/day, resulted in significant improvement in his nutritional status. After 3 months, his weight increased from 27.4 to 35 kg, or 87% of his ideal body weight. All nutritional parameters were improved: serum transferrin was increased from 1,880 to 3,070 mg/l, prealbumin was increased from 132 to 287 mg/l, and retinol binding protein was increased from 22 to 57 mg/l. An upper gastrointestinal series performed 3 months later revealed no duodenal obstruction. Therefore, the patient was allowed oral intake of the enteral preparation. After 1 month of oral feeding, the duodenal tube was removed. The patient was able to eat a normal diet, and his weight gradually increased to 40 kg. At 12-month follow-up, he had not experienced a recurrence of SMA syndrome. DISCUSSION We have described SMA syndrome in a child with mitochondrial encephalopathy. Disorders of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are heterogeneous in clinical phenotype and biochemical abnormalities. Biochemical and immunoblot analysis in this patient showed relative complex I deficiency. Complex I deficiency is known to be present in such conditions as MERRF, MELAS, MNGIE, and Leigh disease. Episodic vomiting is common in MELAS. However, our patient could not be classified clinically as having MELAS, because he had not had stroke-like episodes. Mitochondrial DNA analysis was performed to detect point mutations that have been described in association with MELAS. The common point mutations at nt 3243, nt 3255, and nt 3271 were not seen in his lymphocytes. Calcification of bilateral basal ganglia suggest a possibility of Leigh disease; however, ragged red fibers usually do not appear in Leigh disease. The point mutation reported in Leigh disease was not detected. Ophthalmoplegia, peripheral neuropathy, gastrointestinal symptoms, and leukoencephalopathy are clinical characteristics of MNGIE. Our patient had no peripheral neuropathy or ophthalmoplegia. Improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, by short-term conservative enteral nutrition showed that episodic vomiting is not attributable to mitochondrial dysfunction in itself. What would cause SMA syndrome in a patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy? The horizontal portion of the duodenum passes in front of the abdominal aorta and behind the superior mesenteric artery, at the level of the first lumbar vertebra (i.e., the SMA may compress the relatively immobile third portion of the duodenum to produce a “nutcracker” effect[12]). Precipitating factors of SMA syndrome include a prolonged supine position, visceroptosis, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, abnormally high fixation of the duodenal fixture of the ligament of Treitz, an unusually low origin of the SMA, loss of muscle tone in the duodenum, and a marked loss of weight with an associated loss of mesenteric and retroperitoneal fat (13). Severe weight loss and malnutrition, caused by repeated episodes of vomiting associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy, were the apparent precipitating factors in our patient. Radiographs of the upper gastrointestinal tract with use of contrast medium is the standard method for diagnosing the SMA syndrome. Hines et al. cited the following roentgenographic criteria for this syndrome: dilatation of the first and second portions of the duodenum, abrupt vertical and oblique compression of the mucosal folds, antiperistaltic flow of barium proximal to the obstruction producing to-and-fro movements, a 4- to 6-hour delay in transit through the gastroduodenal region, and relief of obstruction when the patient is placed in a position that diminishes the drag of the small bowel mesentery(2). Our patient met most of these criteria. There is a danger of missing a diagnosis of duodenal obstruction in mitochondrial encephalopathy because this disorder is also characterized by episodic vomiting. Therefore, SMA syndrome should be considered when making the diagnosis of duodenal obstruction. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SMA syndrome in a patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy. The syndrome may thus be associated with such metabolic disorders as mitochondrial encephalopathy that are characterized by recurrent vomiting.Fig. 1: .

      "title": "Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Initial symptoms of multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) can develop from infancy through early childhood, and presentation is widely variable. Some individuals display the multisystemic features characteristic of mucopolysaccharidosis disorders (e.g., developmental regression, organomegaly, skeletal deformities) while other individuals present primarily with neurologic regression (associated with leukodystrophy). Based on age of onset, rate of progression, and disease severity, several different clinical subtypes of MSD have been described: Neonatal MSD is the most severe with presentation in the prenatal period or at birth with rapid progression and death occurring within the first two years of life. Infantile MSD is the most common variant and may be characterized as attenuated (slower clinical course with cognitive disability and neurodegeneration identified in the 2nd year of life) or severe (loss of the majority of developmental milestones by age 5 years). Juvenile MSD is the rarest subtype with later onset of symptoms and subacute clinical presentation. Many of the features found in MSD are progressive, including neurologic deterioration, heart disease, hearing loss, and airway compromise. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of multiple sulfatase deficiency is established in a proband with low activity levels in at least two sulfatase enzymes and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in SUMF1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Progressive hydrocephalus, seizures, spasticity, spine instability or stenosis, eye anomalies, cardiovascular disease, hearing loss, poor growth, dental anomalies, developmental delays, and respiratory issues are managed in the standard fashion. Obstructive sleep apnea may be treated with adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy, although affected individuals have a higher surgical complication rate; ventilator support (CPAP, BiPAP) can also be considered. Precautions are needed during anesthesia to address airway maintenance, as progressive upper airway obstruction and cervical spine instability are common. Poor bone health may require supplementation with vitamin D and encouragement of weight-bearing exercises. Alternative routes for nutrition (tube feeding) are frequently necessary. Surveillance: Monitoring of head circumference at each visit; serial brain/spine imaging, as needed based on symptoms; cervical spine imaging prior to any procedure that requires neck extension. At least annual vitamin D level, eye examination with intraocular pressure measurement, EKG, echocardiogram, and audiology evaluation. Abdominal ultrasound, sleep study and pulmonary function tests, neuropsychiatric testing, and assessment of blood and urine acid-base balance as clinically indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Neck hyperextension (including hyperextension used for intubation) because of the risk of spinal cord compression; foods that are a choking hazard. Genetic Counseling Multiple sulfatase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% change of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible using molecular genetic techniques if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.",

Mild cognitive impairment is a clinical state, sometimes prodromal to fully symptomatic AD, where cognitive deficit can be delineated by psychometric testing. AD pathogenesis is associated with progressive accumulation of a toxic and hydrophobic As peptide in the brain, which starts a number of years prior to the onset of clinical symptoms (yellow dotted line). This preclinical stage of the disease is dubbed the “brain AD stage”. Progressive accumulation of As in the brain results in a number of secondary pathological processes including neurofibrillary degeneration, inflammation, synaptic loss, and neuronal dropout, whose severity correlates with clinical symptoms of the disease (magenta dashed line).",

Although the presentation of acute illness in these patients is often similar to that in people without pre-existing disability, sometimes it may be atypical. In addition, an adequate medical history is often difficult to obtain in patients with advanced neurological disease, for example because of the presence of aphasia, severe dysarthria, or cognitive impairment. In these circumstances early and accurate diagnosis of acute medical and surgical emergencies requires both clinical acumen and a high index of suspicion. The aim of this article is to describe the main atypical manifestations of acute illness in patients with chronic disabling neurological disorders.",

Quite commonly we draw conclusions about an entire population of persons with a specific disorder, or we consider a finding as the correlate of the disorder itself. Several considerations prove this type of generalization wrong, and may lead to false conclusions: for example epidemiological data obtained from rates of medical utilization, the comparison of ill persons and patients suffering from functional gastrointestinal disorders, or a survey of literature about the significance of illness behavior and psychological factors in the demand for medical care. The consequences effect not only the interpretation of empirical results, and the selection of sample survey, but also send a call for fieldstudies on the relevant disorders.",

Clinicians are often faced with the challenge of identifying an underlying endocrine etiology for behavioral changes based on relatively nonspecific symptoms. A general understanding of the signs and symptoms associated with elevated or decreased hormone levels can assist in the differential diagnosis and ultimately increase the likelihood that a patient receives appropriate treatment.

      "title": "Neuropathic pain",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain (NP) is defined as “pain arising as a direct consequence of any lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.”[12] Although NP may be an idiopathic process reflecting abnormal sensory processing in the peripheral or central nervous system, it more often appears following physical insult or disease affecting the peripheral or central nervous system. It is likely that chronic peripheral neuropathy may lead to neuroplastic changes and affect the central nervous system. These functional and anatomical changes can exacerbate the overall experience of pain. As the changes become more chronic, co-morbid conditions such as sleep disorders, anxiety and depression can accompany the chronic pain, and further complicate treatment. The prevalence of NP conditions is difficult to establish. There are many confounding factors that may lead to under-reporting of NP. In primary medical care settings, the prevalence has been reported to be between 2 and 11%.[34] Studies have focused on specific NP conditions, secondary to other pathological conditions. It has been shown that the about 26% of patients with type 2 diabetes can experience neuropathy. Cancer patients indicate a prevalence of 19–39. About 1% and 37% of chronic low back pain patients may have a neuropathic component related to it.[567] Even with high prevalence in chronic conditions, the overall numbers of NP conditions tends to be small. One of the reasons is the lack of identification, diagnosis, and treatment. There is no standard approach between health care providers for NP. NP can be localized to the craniofacial region such as in trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia, painful traumatic trigeminal neuropathy (PTTN), burning mouth syndrome, or may affect other areas of the body such as in case of diabetic neuropathy. In the orofacial region, NP mainly affects the trigeminal nerve and can be referred to as Neuropathic Orofacial Pain (NOP). Peripheral NP can be a result of nerve damage. Different types of nerve damage such as crush, transection, partial transection, and inflammatory insult can induce various clinical pain presentations and further complicate the process of diagnosis and management. In the orofacial region, development of pain following nerve damage (i.e., PTTN) is around 3–5%, which is low when compared to other parts of the body, where an incidence of painful traumatic neuropathy is 5–17%.[891011] PTTN secondary to dental procedures can be a major complication. Third molar extractions have been reported to cause altered sensations in 0.3–1% of cases.[121314] Persistent pain after successful endodontics has been found to occur in 3–13% of the patients.[151617] The incidence of neurosensory disturbance post implant can range anywhere from 0.6 to 36%.[18192021] Causes of central pain may include trauma, cerebrovascular injuries, tumors, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. NP can also be classified based on frequency into continuous or episodic. Episodic neuropathies are usually characterized by short, sudden, sharp, or electrical like paroxysmal pain. The pain is usually severe and sporadic in nature. Continuous NP is usually characterized by continuous dull pain of mild to moderate intensity with occasional paroxysms of pain. There is presently no definitive cure to this condition, and the available treatment requires long-term prescription medications with significant side effects. In some cases, surgical procedures and adjunctive therapy are also recommended. Evaluation of sensory alterations can be performed using quantitative sensory testing which is a noninvasive assessment of normal and abnormal responses of the nervous system to various stimuli. Mapping and sketches of the affected area can help treatment decisions and management. The medications used for NP can include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antiarrhythmics, opioids and nonopioid analgesics, and topical medications.[22] Adjunctive treatment can include but is not limited to a variety of options which include physical therapy, acupuncture, hypnosis, counseling, biofeedback, massage, relaxation, pressure, herbs, yoga, exercise, and electrotherapy. The prevailing “trial and error” approach to NP treatment includes a titration regimen of 3–8 weeks which is very often repeated several times before an effective medication for the individual patient is identified. As health care providers it is important to recognize NOP conditions to avoid unnecessary treatment and suffering. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

A genetic diagnosis also provides better prognostic information about the disease course; allows better screening for and treatment of disease-associated complications in other organ systems; eliminates unnecessary testing; and provides closure for the patient, making them eligible for disease-specific clinical trials. The routine evaluation should include assessment for liver or spleen enlargement, eye involvement such as iris abnormalities, early cataracts, retinopathy, or optic atrophy. Another rarely volunteered but easily asked piece of information is whether there are any foods the patient avoids or cannot eat because they cause problems. The standard diagnostic evaluation for acute or recurrent encephalopathy should include simple laboratory tests for signs of metabolic disorders such as metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, or hypoglycemia.",

Los diagnosticos mas frecuentes en clinicas especializadas son en primer lugar la enfermedad de Alzheimer, y en segundo lugar la demencia vascular o la demencia frontotemporal segun las series. Las demencias en el adulto joven se diferencian de las demencias en los adultos mayores por una serie de aspectos clinicos y asistenciales especificos. Por ejemplo, con debuts con formas clinicas inusuales o diferentes de las de la misma enfermedad en personas mayores, y con una mayor frecuencia de trastornos no-cognitivos que puede llegar hasta el 80% de los casos. Por desgracia, estas demencias tienden a diagnosticarse mas tarde que las demencias de inicio tardio. Este retraso diagnostico se ve facilitado por la falta generalizada de servicios especializados, y por la falta de concienciacion en la comunidad medica y en la sociedad en general acerca de estas enfermedades, lo cual contribuye tambien a un mayor estres en familiares y cuidadores EnglishYoung-onset dementias begin before the age of 65 years and from an epidemiological point of view are less frequent than those dementias with an onset in later life. The most frequent diagnoses in specialist clinics are Alzheimer’s disease in the first instance followed by vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia depending on the series. Young-onset dementias differ from those in older adults in a variety of specific clinical and service provision aspects. For example, with unusual or different presentations from those of the same illness in older adults, and because of a greater frequency of non-cognitive disorders that can reach up to 80% of cases. Unfortunately, these dementias tend to be diagnosed later compared to those in older adults. This diagnostic delay is possible due to the lack of specialist services and the of awareness in the medical community and society at large regarding these conditions, something that also contributes to the raised burden of care in families and carers.",

Some individuals have severe symptoms that cause repeated and prolonged awakenings. Others are aware of only mild symptoms at bedtime that prolong falling asleep. Patients may complain of insomnia, especially difficulty with sleep onset and repeated nighttime awakenings. Most characteristic of restless legs syndrome are reports of sensations deep in the muscles. This disorder may begin at any age, including during childhood.

      "title": "Is later-life depression a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease or a prodromal symptom: a study using post-mortem human brain tissue?",
      "abstract": "Depression and dementia are both common diseases. Although new cases of depression are more common in younger adults, there is a second peak at the age of 50 years suggesting a different pathological process. Late-life depression (LLD) is associated with dementia. However, it remains unclear whether depression represents a dementia prodrome or is a true risk factor for its development. LLD is thought to have a vascular component and this may be a possible link between depression and dementia. We hypothesised that later-life depression is a prodromal manifestation of dementia and would therefore be associated with more AD, and/or ischaemic brain abnormalities that are present in earlier-life depression or in age- and sex-matched controls. We assessed post-mortem orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex from 145 individuals in 4 groups: 28 18-50-year-olds with depression, 30 older individuals (ages 51-90) with depression, 28 with early AD (Braak tangle stages III-IV) and 57 matched controls (17 early-life, 42 later-life). Levels of Aβ, phospho-tau and α-synuclein were assessed by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. To quantify chronic ischaemia, VEGF, MAG and PLP1 were measured by ELISA. To assess pericyte damage, PDGFRB was measured by ELISA. For blood-brain barrier leakiness, JAM-A, claudin 5 and fibrinogen were measured by ELISA. To quantity endothelial activation, the ratio of ICAM1:collagen IV was assessed by immunohistochemistry. There was no evidence of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion or increased Aβ/tau in either depression group. There was also no indication of pericyte damage, increased blood-brain barrier leakiness or endothelial activation in the OFC or DLPFC in the depression groups. Contrary to some previous findings, we have not found evidence of impaired vascular function or increased Aβ in LLD. Our study had a relatively small sample size and limitations in the availability of clinical data. These results suggest that depression is a risk factor for dementia rather than an early manifestation of AD or a consequence of cerebral vascular insufficiency.",

      "abstract": "Non-epileptic paroxysmal events (NEPE) are defined as episodes of sudden onset and short duration that mimic an epileptic seizure, caused by a brain dysfunction of diverse origin and, unlike epilepsy, are not due to excessive neuronal discharge. Its incidence is much higher than epilepsy and can appear at any age, but are more frequent in the first years of life. The immaturity of the central nervous system in childhood favors that in this period the clinical manifestations are more spectacular and different from other ages. Normal and common phenomena in children can also be confused with epileptic seizures. The first step for a correct diagnosis is to establish whether this first episode corresponds to an epileptic seizure or could be a first episode of NEPE. It is important to follow a diagnostic protocol, assessing the personal and family history, without forgetting the physical examination, analyzing the possible triggering factors, the details of each episode, if it's possible a record of the episodes, applying common sense and experience and only carrying out basic complementary tests such as EEG recording or others in case of doubt or for diagnostic confirmation. In some cases, a genetic basis has been demonstrated. Therapeutic options are scarce and the majority of NEPE have a favorable evolution.Los eventos paroxísticos no epilépticos (EPNE) se definen como episodios de aparición brusca y de breve duración que imitan a una crisis epiléptica, originados por una disfunción cerebral de origen diverso y a diferencia de la epilepsia no obedecen a una descarga neuronal excesiva. Su incidencia es mucho más elevada que la epilepsia y pueden aparecer a cualquier edad, pero son más frecuentes en los primeros años de vida. La inmadurez del sistema nervioso central en la infancia favorece que en este período las manifestaciones clínicas sean muy floridas y diferentes de otras edades. Fenómenos normales y comunes en el niño pueden también confundirse con crisis epilépticas. El primer paso para un diagnóstico correcto es establecer si este primer episodio corresponde a una crisis epiléptica o puede tratarse de un primer episodio de EPNE. Es importante seguir un protocolo de diagnóstico, valorando los antecedentes personales y familiares, sin olvidar el examen físico, analizar los posibles factores desencadenantes, los pormenores de cada episodio, si es posible un registro de los episodios, aplicar el sentido común y la experiencia y solamente proceder a los exámenes complementarios básicos como el registro EEG u otras exploraciones en caso de duda o para confirmación diagnóstica. En algunos casos se ha demostrado una base genética. Las opciones terapéuticas son escasas y la mayoría de EPNE tienen una evolución favorable.",

Кратко рассмотрены механизмы ЦА; приводятся данные о пирролах и пиролурии. Описаны основные неврологические и психиатрические проявления ЦА и пиролурии, а также подходы к их лечению.Отмечено, что имеются все основания полагать, что механизмы возникновения ЦА не имеют существенных отличий от таковых при формировании других аллергических реакций (при пищевой аллергии), основанных на двух основных типах иммунного ответа (сопряженных с избыточной выработкой IgE или с тучными клетками). Симптомы ЦА многочисленны и многообразны. Они зависят от возраста пациентов и могут манифестировать в чрезвычайно широких пределах. Спектр проявлений ЦА варьирует от приступов потери сознания и/или головных болей в сочетании с крапивницей, зудом и нарушениями зрения или транзиторных нарушений речи (афазия и т. д.) до одностороннего онемения конечностей и/или языка, сонливости, ступора, бессонницы, неспособности к концентрации, раздражительности, возбудимости, депрессии, тревожности, головокружения, мышечных проявлений. Проявления ЦА обычно находят выражение в форме конкретных психических нарушений (шизофрения, депрессия, галлюцинации, бред, кататония, эпилепсия, аутизм и т. д.).Указывается, что стандартных методов терапии для ЦА и пиролурии не разработано. Существующие подходы частично являются эмпирическими, а частично теоретически обоснованными. Обычно детям с церебральными проявлениями аллергии назначается гипоаллергенная (элиминационная) диета различной степени интенсивности. При необходимости такая диета может достигать уровня олигоантигенной.",

      "abstract": "The pathology of epilepsy is a complex and evolving field, reflecting both rapid developments in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, and the continued difficulties in translating electrical and functional phenomena into traditional categories of morphological disease. A seizure is an acute neurological event due to sudden excessive disorderly discharge of neurons.1 Lesions that are presumed to cause seizures can be either structural, definable by morphological techniques such as radiology and anatomic pathology, or functional, definable by clinical localization, electrophysiology, and, in some cases, functional imaging defining a focus. Causality is inferred by correlation of morphological findings and location with clinical and electrophysiological data and, in some cases, by the cessation of subsequent seizures after removal of the lesion or focus. Epilepsy is intermittent recurrence of seizures. The finding of structural lesions in some forms of epilepsy suggests and supports causality, but our understanding of the chain between the definable structural lesion and the recurrence of seizures is often less clear.2 Causality may be particularly difficult to determine in conditions producing multiple structural lesions such as tuberous sclerosis, where one lesion is epileptogenic and other similar lesions are not. Even determining how a particular electrically active focus propagates to evolve into a particular seizure or series of intractable seizures is also incompletely understood. To add to the difficulty, seizures or epilepsy itself can be causal, resulting in progressive brain damage and self-perpetuating seizures, particularly in some forms of temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, some treatments for epilepsy themselves have been associated with some forms of brain damage.",

      "title": "An Unexpected Cause of Hyperactive Delirium in Patients with Decompensated Nonalcoholic Cirrhosis",
      "abstract": "Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that typically involves a plethora of cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms, resulting in a broad spectrum of differential diagnosis dominated by mental disorders. The prevalence of delirium in elderly patients admitting to hospital is 5-55% [1]. Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome that may occur in several different settings and one of them is vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes many cerebral cortex abnormalities such as confusion, mood and memory changes, delirium with or without hallucinations, depression and acute psychotic states [2,3]. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) describes the spectrum of potentially reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities seen in patients with liver dysfunction after exclusion of unrelated neurologic and/or metabolic abnormalities. The clinical manifestations of HE is characterized by cognitive and motor deficits of varying severity without specific lesions in the central nervous system. The symptoms range from minimal changes in personality to coma, including delirium [4]. Usually, in the elderly patients with cirrhosis, it is hard to differentiate two clinical situations. Here we report a case of an elderly patient with cirrhosis who experienced delirium due to vitamin B12 deficiency, but was treated as HE before.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

For patients with cognitive impairment a caregiver with knowledge of the patient’s family and personal medical history completed the registry form. Upon death, remaining medical records were collected and neuropathological analyses were performed. Patients were brought to autopsy according to standardized protocols for brain handling and processing. The clinical diagnosis of PSP was made either by movement disorders specialists and/or general neurologists before death and was clearly documented in the medical fi les. Two patients were only evaluated by a general neurologist. Multiple documented neurological evaluations throughout the course of the patients’ illness were reviewed. Diagnoses were re-confi rmed after death by a movement disorders specialist (S.P.), who applied standard criteria for PSP [4] (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, prominent postural instability, falls in the fi rst year of onset, and no evidence of other disorders to explain the neurologic fi ndings). Diagnoses of dementia and psychiatric disorders were made by the patients’ treating physicians and were clearly documented in the medical fi les. Clear documentation of dementia included diagnosis by a psychiatrist, formal psychometric testing and/or Mini-Mental State Examination ! 24 [5] . The characterDear Sir, Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is the most common and best recognized atypical parkinsonian syndrome. The clinical characteristics of PSP as described by Steele, Richardson and Olszewsky [1] in 1964 include parkinsonian features, postural instability, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, pseudobulbar symptoms and cognitive decline. However, it has been widely recognized that PSP is characterized by an ever-expanding and ‘diverse’ clinical phenotype [2] that among others includes a fl orid neuropsychiatric symptomatology [3] . This report focuses on the description of hallucinations in a small cohort of clinically and pathologically diagnosed PSP patients. Our study population consisted of 22 consecutive PSP patients. All subjects consented during life to donate their brains to the University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank TM . Brain donors were recruited and registered with the Brain Bank through a campaign performed throughout the United States over the last decade. All donors completed the Brain Bank’s PD registry form (a 128-item, self-administered questionnaire) providing information about demographics, environmental exposures, personal and family history, activities of daily living, clinical and treatment details. Yearly updates on all brain donors were obtained until death. Medical and hospital Received: July 7, 2005 Accepted: September 28, 2005 Published online: January 6, 2006",

Revisar aquellos trastornos neurologicos caracterizados principalmente por un patron de afectacion paroxistico, y en los cuales se ha identificado una etiologia genetica o metabolica clara. Desarrollo. El termino `paroxistico´ hace referencia al inicio repentino de las manifestaciones clinicas de una manera relativamente estereotipada, normalmente tras la exposicion a unos factores desencadenantes especificos con la resolucion casi total de estos signos entre los episodios. Tipicamente no se asocian a una evolucion incesante ni a un deterioro gradual, y la mayoria no conducen al desarrollo de anomalias neuropatologicas importantes. Aunque por la heterogeneidad de las manifestaciones clinicas y deficiencias subyacentes resultan dificiles de clasificar, por motivos practicos se propone una aproximacion basada en el eje cerebroespinal que permite organizarlas, por ejemplo, desde las patologias que afectan de modo predominante a la sustancia gris de la corteza cerebral (manifestadas principalmente en forma de crisis) hasta las que tienen un patron de afectacion casi exclusivamente muscular y/o neuromuscular. La mayoria esta causada por anomalias geneticas en los transportadores o en los canales neuronales, que pueden ser iones o neurotransmisores. En los ultimos anos, el concepto de `canalopatias´ ha tenido mayor aceptacion en el ambito medico, aunque no todos los trastornos descritos son causados por defectos en los canales moleculares.

      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

For each of these categories, clinical neuropathological and relevant animal evidence is reviewed. It is concluded that \"memory\" is not holistic, and the anatomical bases must be considered independently for each of the several dissociable (but normally interacting) systems.

When there are evidences of associated functional disturbances in other organ systems or in the patient as a whole, or characteristic clinical syndromes are present, and there is lack of symptomatic or objective evidence of organic disease on careful examination, the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely.

The essential steps in successful treatment include convincing the patient of the diagnosis, improving and relieving symptoms and avoiding or adequately controlling recurrences.Psychotherapy is a keystone in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Not often, however, are the services of a psychiatrist necessary.

The abnormal fatigability can be shown in the electromyogram. Lasting voluntary contraction of a muscle shows a rarefication of the EMG-pattern. Sometimes during repetitive stimulation of the motor nerve a decrease in the amplitude of the muscle potential may occur. This decrease is poorly influenced by cholinergic drugs. Often this observation was present in patients with myositis and myotonic dystrophy, sometimes in other myopathies and seldom in neurogenic disorders. A failure in the neuromuscular transmission is discussed not only in myasthenia gravis, but also in myasthenic syndromes. But there may be another explanation. A decreased number of intact muscle fibers during lasting innervation will cause a more rapid fatigation of the muscle fibers and in this way there will be an exhaustion. It is discussed, whether the symptoms in myasthenic syndromes can be explained by an abnormal \"fatigability\".",

The most difficult is to diagnose depression with onset in early childhood, including infant's age, when the psychopathological presentations depend on the consequences of the perinatal CNS lesion, maternal deprivation and other factors. In children, the clinical picture of depression differs by syndromologic incompleteness, peculiarity of phenomenological presentations and polymorphism of disorders. In adolescence, depression is characterized by the predominance of behavioral disorders, marked psychopathic-like disorders, suicidal attempts, higher frequency of bipolar forms. Depression with late age at onset differs by the abundance of somatic and hypochondriac complaints, anxiety and depressive delusion accompanied by the transitory aggravation of cognitive impairment (depressive pseudodementia).",

      "abstract": "Work stress is defined as the emotional and/or physical reaction that the human being has in situations that surround him; in addition it can also be defined as a physiological and psychological response of the worker. Studies on job stress have revealed that lately this problem or condition has greatly affected people who work as workers; since the consequences of suffering stress from work are sufficient, they are also serious and in some cases difficult to manage. Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor. Be very careful, because if it can be avoided they can cause fatal damage to humans or even cause death.",

They may aggravate psychiatric disorders, perpetuate them or predict a disease onset, like in depressive or manic episodes. Also in organic sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders or nocturnal movement disorders, increased anxiety or depression scores may be observed. Patients suffering from sleep disorders do not only experience impaired well-being, but also show deteriorations in cognition and performance, have a higher risk of accidents, are generally more prone to health problems, have a higher sickness absence rate, seek medical help more often and thus are also an important socioeconomic factor. This is why sleep disorders should be taken seriously and treated adequately.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a very complex disorder of the central nervous system. It is characterized by a sudden, disordered and excessive neuronal shock that causes different clinical evidences with specific related electroencephalogram (EEG). Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES) can seriously complicate the diagnosis of epilepsy. The separoxysmal events have the same clinical evidences of epilepsy, such as an impairment of the self-control and a range of sensory, motor and mental manifestations, without the typical related electroencephalogram (EEG) because of the absence of an organic cause. The overwhelming majority of Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures are related to psychological factors like dissociation. This is a defense mechanism used to cope stressful events or emotional conflicts. Psychological or psychiatric disorders, like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), are frequently associated to Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures. In this article, we present a case report of epilepsy combined with Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures. A joint intervention is of great significance in this occurrence. The subject received a psychological assessment including psychometric and projective tools. He stood MMPI-2, Wais-R, SCL-90, Rorschach test and graphic tests. A psychological disorder related to defense mechanisms was identified. The subject presents a tendency to convert his fears and emotive pains in rational and more socially acceptable problems, using his body to express his discomfort. Patient with epileptic seizures should receive a psychological assessment to exclude Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures. Further studies should propose guidelines to integrate neurological, psychiatric and psychological intervention.",

In the case of hemiplegia following cerebral congestion the duration of the pathological condition is short, and the resulting mental disturbance is slight and not usually of long duration. The extent of the paralysis, its duration, and the resultant mental disturbance depend upon the situation and extent of the pathological lesion.

      "abstract": "The term \"illness\" implies a medical disease model, namely that symptoms or syndromes indicate an underlying organic disease - in the case of psychiatry a disorder of the brain. But no brain markers could be identified until today, which would indicate a psychiatric illness or in particular a certain psychiatric illness. Furthermore organic causes of a mental disorder are an exclusion criterion for a diagnosis of a mental disorder. For all these reasons all international classifications systems use the term \"disorder\" instead of \"illness\". Beyond the question if mental disorders are disorders of the brain one might challenge the concept of psychiatric diagnoses at all. Most diagnostic thresholds are arbitrary or imposed on pragmatic grounds. For a categorical diagnosis to be scientifically valid, clear symptom boundaries should separate it from other conditions. But this is rarely the case concerning psychiatric diagnoses. In many respects a dimensional approach would be much more appropriate than a categorical view. A dimensional approach would reflect the fact that mental problems are part of the human condition, which turn into psychiatric disorders when the affected individual cannot perform his or her social roles any longer. The personal, social and environmental factors that determine mental health and mental illness may be clustered conceptually around themes like the development and maintenance of healthy communities and each person's ability to deal with the social world and manage his or her life. All this would be much more helpful than the conceptualisation of mental disorders as brain diseases.",

While most experts ascribe poor performance to neurocognitive impairment, an emerging literature is identifying important nonspecific mediators of neurocognitive test performance, some of which can be accounted for in trials (eg, motivation, effort, defeatist performance beliefs, stress, anxiety, physical inactivity). Other factors are harder, if not impossible, to control when patients are compared to non-clinical participants (eg, hospitalization, medication effects, distraction due to positive symptoms). Effect sizes of neurocognitive performance differences are usually not adjusted for these confounders, and the level of neurocognitive impairment due to schizophrenia is thus likely exaggerated. We suggest some ways for researchers to account for the effects of these mediators. Secondary influences that negatively affect neurocognitive performance should not be treated as mere noise. They give important insight into causal mechanisms and may inform more effective treatments that go beyond cognitive remediation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Lymphoma occasionally affects the peripheral nervous system. When it does, the diagnosis can be elusive since many patients present without known lymphoma. Most peripheral nerve complications are due to non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), which infiltrates nerves causing axonal damage. This disorder can affect nerve roots and cranial nerves, often associated with lymphomatous meningitis. NHL may also infiltrate peripheral nerves and cause plexopathy, mononeuropathy, or generalized neuropathy. These neuropathies may resemble an asymmetric mononeuropathy multiplex or a generalized disorder such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. When NHL infiltrates diffusely, the term neurolymphomatosis is used. Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), by contrast, rarely infiltrates nerves. More often, HL causes immunological disorders of the peripheral nervous system such as inflammatory plexopathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome. Other rare lymphomas such as intravascular lymphoma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia can also affect peripheral nerves in specific ways. In addition, other malignant and nonmalignant lymphoproliferative disorders enter into the differential diagnosis of lymphomatous neuropathy. This review discusses the multiple peripheral nerve presentations of lymphoma from the clinician's point of view and provides a guide to the evaluation and diagnosis of these uncommon, challenging disorders.

High-risk and cohort studies demonstrate that children destined to develop schizophrenia tend to have delayed milestones and subtle neuromotor and cognitive impairments (particularly in coordination and language). These neurocognitive problems lead to difficulties in interpersonal relations, and their progressive alienation makes these at-risk children more likely to harbor odd or paranoid ideas. This cascade of increasingly deviant development may then be compounded by brain maturational changes during adolescence with a resultant lability of the dopaminergic response to stress. As a result, the individual is more susceptible to the effects of the abuse of dopamine-releasing drugs, and to other risk factors such as migration or stressful life events; social isolation may be a common pathway underlying several of the social risk factors.",

      "abstract": "According to the classification criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology, fibromyalgia is a long-standing multifocal pain condition combined with generalised allodynia/hyperalgesia. It is the generalised allodynia/hyperalgesia that distinguishes fibromyalgia from other conditions with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Central sensitisation of nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn due to activation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors and disinhibition of pain due to deficient function of the descending inhibitory system are probable pathogenic factors for allodynia/hyperalgesia. Furthermore, chronic pain is a chronic emotional and physical stressor. Chronic stress and chronic sleep disturbance are not specific for fibromyalgia but could be the causes of symptoms like fatigue, cognitive difficulties and other stress-related symptoms. They may also cause neuroendocrinological and immunological aberrations.",

      "abstract": "There are a number of cardiomyopathies secondary to a more widespread striated muscle involvement. While in some conditions the heart is affected as part of a severe myopathy (such as the dilated cardiomyopathy found in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies), there are examples in which the skeletal muscle involvement is subtle. From a classification point of view, some of these cardiomyopathies are secondary to muscular dystrophies, or to metabolic disorders, or to other myopathies. From a practical diagnostic point of view, metabolic conditions predominate in infancy, whereas the dystrophic forms are more frequently found from the third decade onwards. Useful clinical clues to suggest a skeletal muscle involvement are muscle hypertrophy or wasting and contractures, in addition to weakness. Serum creatine kinase should always be studied when suspecting a form secondary to a muscular dystrophy, although a normal serum creatine kinase does not exclude a muscular dystrophy. Electromyography and muscle imaging are additional useful investigations in these patients. This article is focused on practical clinical suggestions on when to suspect and how to investigate patients with a cardiomyopathy secondary to neuromuscular disorders.",

      "abstract": "\"Jail syndrome\" is a condition emerging in individuals of high profile and status facing legal repercussions due to involvement in corruption or other illegal activities. This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of symptoms, including anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosomatic symptoms such as chest pain, headache, hysterical attacks, and many more with minimal positive investigations and other evaluations. Its prevalence is notably high among high-profile individuals such as politicians and bureaucrats in contexts marked by corruption, especially in India. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in response to arrest or legal proceedings, complicating clinical diagnosis due to the lack of identifiable organic causes. Distinguishing jail syndrome from genuine medical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes is crucial for effective management. The syndrome reflects a circumstantial diagnosis influenced by the psychological stress of legal consequences, necessitating a careful assessment of both psychological and physiological health. Large-scale studies, research, and data analysis are essential to validate jail syndrome as a recognized clinical diagnosis. Jail syndrome is a self-explanatory clinical diagnosis to convey the onset of symptomatology, etiopathology, and treatment strategy in a person involved in illicit activities with history of charges, imprisonment, or sentencing to jail. Most important is to rule out organic disease because many times organic causes such as acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HT) are present. Very important is that large-scale data and their scientific analysis are required to confirm and recognize it as a definite clinical diagnosis of \"jail syndrome.\" No doubt the term jail syndrome is self-explanatory and conveys the message we want to convey.",

      "title": "Insomnia in peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women and in some somatic diseases",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

      "title": "POSSIBLE PREDICTORS OF VASCULAR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT–NO DEMENTIA",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The term “predementia syndrome” identifies all conditions with age-related deficits in cognitive function reported in the literature, including a mild stage of cognitive impairment based on a normality model and pathological conditions considered predictive or early stages of dementia.1,2 Such predementia syndromes have been defined for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but have not yet been operationalized for vascular dementia (VaD) and other specific forms of dementia. Therefore, the term “predementia syndromes” includes different conditions, and of these predementia syndromes, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the most widely used term to indicate older persons without dementia with no significant disability and mild memory or cognitive impairment that cannot be accounted for by any recognized medical or psychiatric condition.1,2 Predementia syndrome is, therefore, an umbrella term that includes also the preclinical phase of dementia of numerous rating scales developed for staging dementia (i.e., Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale score of 0.5 or “questionable dementia”).1 There is now ample evidence that MCI is often a pathology-based condition with a high rate of progression to AD.1,2 Therefore, MCI, and particularly amnestic MCI (aMCI) was also identified as the predementia syndrome for AD. The more recently proposed multiple subtypes of MCI were intended to reflect the heterogeneity of different types of dementia. Actually, the recent subclassification of MCI according to its cognitive features (dysexecutive MCI and aMCI or aMCI and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI): single domain aMCI and multiple domain aMCI or single domain naMCI, and multiple domain naMCI), clinical presentation (MCI with parkinsonism, or cerebrovascular disease (CVD), or depressive symptoms, or behavioral and psychological symptoms) or likely etiology (MCI-AD, vascular MCI, or MCI-Lewy body dementia) represents an attempt to control this heterogeneity.1,2 In particular, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a heterogeneous group of cognitive disorders that share a presumed vascular cause.3 In 2003, it was hypothesized that people with VCI have a specific cognitive profile in which memory is preserved and executive function impaired.4 Within the VCI construct, the parallel condition to MCI is VCI–no dementia (VCI-ND) or vascular predementia MCI, defined as the clinical phenotype of cognitive impairment of a presumed vascular cause that is not severe enough to meet the criteria for dementia.3 NaMCI can, in some cases, be vascular in origin, and other subtypes of MCI can progress to VCI.3 The Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) found that, in elderly people with VCI-ND, low scores on tests of memory and semantic category fluency predicted incident cases of dementia (VaD and AD combined) 5 years later. Most of these incident cases had VaD.5 Other groups have also shown that reductions in memory, as part of a more global pattern of impairment, precede diagnoses of VaD and AD by up to 4 years.3,6 In the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA), in 2,963 individuals from a population-based sample, it was found that, in a predementia syndrome with a cognitive pattern similar to AD and with a central role for memory decline (aMCI), in those who progressed to dementia, 60% progressed to AD and 33% to VaD or VCI.6 Recently, in the CSHA, in people with no cognitive impairment at baseline, abstract reasoning was considerably worse in those who developed VCI than in those who developed AD and had memory impairment.7 These results suggest the existence of a preclinical phase of VCI (VCI-ND) during which widespread but subtle executive dysfunction plus memory impairment may be detected some years before a clinical diagnosis can be rendered. Beyond controlling the established vascular risk factors for stroke, prevention of VCI-ND might be possible through physical activity.8 In another recent community-based study, the Fremantle Diabetes Study (FDS), involving 205 older subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 75.3), 164 subjects with normal cognition (CDR=0) and 41 with cognitive impairment without dementia or “questionable dementia” (CDR=0.5), after 1.6 years of follow-up, 33 (16.1%) had experienced cognitive decline. After controlling for age, education, and cognitive function, cognitive decline was predicted by urinary albumin excretion rates, whereas the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) appeared protective.9 The authors correctly acknowledged that blood pressure lowering has been shown to be effective in preventing stroke-related dementia (i.e., VCI), but the data on AD are conflicting,10 although the possible protective effect of ACEIs or ARBs may occur independently of blood pressure lowering. Given this evidence and the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the whole FDS sample, it seems reasonable to postulate that the cognitive impairment without dementia identified with a CDR of 0.5 may be particularly due to vascular pathology (VCI-ND). In conclusion, we strongly suggest a vascular origin for the cognitive impairment without dementia predicted by microalbuminuria and ACEIs or ARBs in the FDS, with a clinical phenotype compatible with VCI-NA. These findings suggest new possible predictors of VCI-ND, beyond reported executive dysfunction plus memory impairment and physical activity.7,8 Conflict of Interest: The editor in chief has reviewed the conflict of interest checklist provided by the authors and has determined that the authors have no financial or any other kind of personal conflicts with this letter.

      "title": "A Clinical Profile of Coma",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nImpaired consciousness is among the most difficult and dramatic of clinical problems. The brain tolerates only limited physical or metabolic injury, so that impaired consciousness is often a sign of impending irreparable damage to the brain. Stupor and coma imply advanced\r\nbrain failure, just as, for example, uremia means renal failure, and the longer such brain failure lasts the narrower the margin between recovery and the development of permanent neurologic injury. The limited time for action and the multiplicity of potential causes of brain\r\nfailure challenge the physician. The physician must organize available information to anticipate as accurately as possible the likelihood that the patient will either recover or remain permanently disabled. Prospective studies of prognosis in adults and children\r\nindicate that within a few hours or days after the onset of coma, neurologic signs and electrophysiologic markers in many patients differentiate, with a high degree of probability, the extremes of no improvement or good recovery. Unfortunately, radiologic and biochemical indicators have generally provided less accurate predictions of outcome, with some exceptions.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nTo determine the incidence, etiology, and outcome of coma, to determine the commonest causes of coma, to recognize unusual presentations and to assess the prognosis in these patients.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nA total of 100 consecutive patients admitted in a comatose state to the IMCU/medical ward in Government Stanley Medical College, were enrolled in this study after prior written and informed consent.\r\nPeriod of the Study: February 2010 To April 2010.\r\nMETHODOLOGY:\r\nA detailed case history was taken.Depression of consciousness was assessed by the GCS. A detailed clinical examination was done.Investigations were guided by the clinical presentation. Neurological outcomes were determined as intact(normal or no change from\r\npre-morbid condition), impaired (alteration of tone,power or reflexes,cranial nerve dysfunction, ataxia, seizures, persistent vegetative state) or death.\r\nInclusion Criteria:\r\n• Cases with coma &focal signs,\r\n• Those without focal signs,\r\n• Cases with coma & fever.\r\nExclusion Criteria:\r\n• Head injury.\r\n• Toxin ingestion.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe GCS is a valuable tool but it may not account for the localized motor, speech and language deficits associated with a focal lesion and hence its accuracy may be affected which has an impact on its prognostic value. The presence of pupillary /eye signs may not portend a poor prognosis in all cases especially in hypoxic injury.\r\nThe initial GCS may be deceptively low in alcoholics. Caution is required while interpreting the clinical findings in alcoholics. There may be difficulties in differentiating the more serious injuries from reversible signs.\r\nThe presence of seizures in a comatose patient may not always signify a poor prognosis in all cases.\r\nThe limitations of our study are that it is an observational study and the number of patients\r\nanalyzed may not be significant to apply the results to a larger population. The observed proportion might represent the lower limit of a confidence interval rather than the mean. Also, actual outcome from the illness in many instances could be worse than the best neurologic state because some patients who recovered temporarily (48 hrs) died of complications later.\r\nA multimodal work up including brain CT, MRI, EEG, somatosensory evoked potentials and clinical examination might be useful in predicting accurate prognosis than any of them alone.",

      "title": "Multiple Chemical Sensitivities: Psychogenic or Toxicodynamic Origins",
      "abstract": "The multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) phenomenon can cause significant dysfunction and symptomatology and presents a difficult challenge for patient management. Central to the MCS debate is whether this phenomenon results from a primary emotional response to perceived chemical exposures or from pathological interactions between chemicals and biological systems. Those who believe the latter argue that toxic interactions result in physiological impairment and that subsequent emotional problems derive from such impairment. Distinguishing between psychogenic (emotional) or a toxicodynamic (chemical toxicity) origin is essential to the medical management of an MCS patient. A psychogenic basis requires treatment with appropriate behavioral therapies; in contrast, a belief in a strictly toxicodynamic etiology argues for avoidance and often precludes treatments that address the psychological responses. Current scientific evidence strongly suggests that behavioral or psychogenic explanations predominate for reported MCS symptoms. Acceptance of a purely toxic origination (i.e., pathological abnormalities result from a low level chemical exposure) defies known toxicological and medical principles; whereas psychogenic explanations are consistent with these principles. Because symptoms are the end points of many diseases with many causes, both physical and emotional, modern medicine is charged with and expected to consider both when treating MCS patients. The argument can be made that insufficient information exists about the causal nature of many diseases, and future research may provide support for a strict toxicodynamic cause. However, the practice of medicine must be based upon current knowledge, not future possibilities. Proper care of MCS patients requires identifying the existence of both psychological and organic pathological dysfunction. The rejection of a psychological aspect of the MCS phenomenon and appropriate behavioral treatments is both illogical and detrimental to MCS sufferers.",

      "title": "Endocannabinoide und andere Lipidmediatoren bei Morbus Parkinson-assoziierten Schmerzen : Untersuchung mittels Quantitativer Sensorischer Testung (QST)",
      "abstract": "Morbus Parkinson ist die zweithäufigste neurodegenerativen Erkrankung, die durch Untergang der dopaminergen Neuronen im Mesenzephalon zu einer Störung des extrapyramidalen motorischen Systems führt. Daraus resultierende Bewegungsstörungen, zu denen Rigor, Tremor, Hypokinese und posturale Instabilität gehören, werden von nichtmotorischen Symptomen wie autonome Dysregulation, veränderte sensorische Wahrnehmung, sowie kognitive und psychische Störungen begleitet. Mehrere Studien berichten über erhöhte Schmerzprävalenz bei Parkinson Patienten. Die genaue Pathogenese der gestörten Schmerzwahrnehmung bleibt unklar. Zusätzlich zu den zentralen Mechanismen entstehen die Schmerzen bei Morbus Parkinson wahrscheinlich durch eine Schädigung der peripheren somatosensorischen und autonomen Neuronen, die sich in sensorischen Defiziten, sowie in erhöhter Schmerzempfindlichkeit manifestieren. Als Korrelat dazu wurden abnormale somatosensorisch evozierte Potenziale, pathologische Ergebnisse in der quantitativen sensorischen Testung und eine Abnahme der Nervenfaserdichte beschrieben. Ein Schwerpunkt unserer Untersuchungen lag auf der Erforschung von potentiellen Veränderungen von Lipidsignalmolekülen. Eine Reihe von Studien zeigen eine Schmerzlinderung durch Cannabis-Einnahme, sowie eine Tendenz zur Schmerzentwicklung bei Parkinson Patienten mit dem bekannten FAAHPolymorphismus. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass eine Störung im Endocannabinoid-System höchstwahrscheinlich zu erhöhter Schmerzprävalenz bei Morbus Parkinson beiträgt. Eine weitere wichtige Lipid-Gruppe sind Glycosylceramide. Ihr Abbau kann durch heterozygote Mutationen des lipidabbauenden Enzyms Glukocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) gestört sein. GBA1 Mutationen sind mit der schnell progredienten sporadischen Verlaufsform der Parkinson-Krankheit assoziiert. Im Rahmen der Studie wurden zwei Kohorten von Parkinson Patienten analysiert. Die 128 Patienten aus Israel wurden im ersten Teil mit 224 jungen gesunden deutschen Probanden verglichen. Im zweiten Teil wurden 50 deutschen Patienten und 50 gesunde altersgleiche Probanden untersucht. Die Schmerzevaluation erfolgte anhand der \"Brief Pain Inventory“ und \"Neuro Detect“ Fragebögen. Bei allen Probanden wurde quantitative sensorische Testung durchgeführt und die Plasmakonzentrationen der Lipidsignalmoleküle mittels quantitativer HPLC-Tandem-Massenspektrometrie analysiert. Nach Auswertung der Schmerzevaluation konnte eine erhöhte Schmerzprävalenz bei Parkinson Patienten festgestellt werden. Die Prävalenz betrug 66% im ersten Teil der Studie und 74% in der deutschen Kohorte, im Vergleich zu 40% bei den altersgleichen gesunden Probanden. Ergebnisse der quantitativen sensorischen Testung zeigen einen Verlust der thermischen Empfindung (erhöhte Schwellen) bei der gleichzeitigen mechanischen Überempfindlichkeit (erniedrigte Schwellen). In der multivariaten LipidAnalyse konnten erniedrigte Konzentrationen von Anandamid und Lysophosphatidsäure 20:4 und eine Erhöhung der Glucosylceramide nachgewiesen werden. Diese Veränderungen waren bei Parkinson Patienten mit Schmerzen stärker ausgeprägt. Außerdem wurde eine lineare Korrelation zwischen Glucosylceramiden (GlcCer 18:1, GlcCer 24:1) und der Schmerzintensität, sowie sensorischem Defizit festgestellt. Nach sorgfältiger Auswertung der Studienergebnisse kommen wir zu der Schlussfolgerung, dass eine Veränderung der Endocannabinoide und der Glucosylceramide zur Pathogenese der Schmerzen und der sensorischen Neuropathie bei Morbus Parkinson beitragen. Die Erkenntnisse könnten zukünftig zur Diagnosestellung durch frühzeitige Erkennung prämotorischer sensorischer Symptome beitragen. Darüber hinaus könnten unsere Ergebnisse zur Therapieoptimierung durch Wiederherstellung der Lipid-Homeostases beitragen.",

Cognitive disorders are common in late life and present unique challenges in clinical settings, such as co‐occurring behavioral and psychological symptoms. Psychological conditions arise less commonly in older than younger individuals. Identifying the cognitive and biomarker features of mental disorders represents a major zeitgeist in psychiatry with potential to improve detection of these disorders, particularly among older individuals, who most often have subsyndromal rather than diagnostic levels of symptoms using current classification systems.",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "abstract": "Les difficultes diagnostiques sont frequentes dans les disciplines neurologiques et psychiatriques, ou les cliniciens manquent de marqueurs physiologiques pour caracteriser certaines maladies, en particulier dans leurs formes debutantes. Depuis quelques annees, le recours a l'electroencephalographie et plus specifiquement haute resolution (EEG-HR) devient plus courant dans l'exploration clinique des pathologies cerebrales, telles que la depression, le coma ou les maladies neurodegeneratives comme la maladie d'Alzheimer. L'activite cerebrale est aisement enregistree avec l’EEG, et l'identification de cette activite permet d'isoler les zones du cerveau et le decours temporel declenche par des stimuli specifiques. L’analyse du signal EEG, et donc son traitement, reste relativement complexe en raison d’un faible rapport signal sur bruit. Dans les etudes conventionnelles, ces problemes sont surmontes en faisant la moyenne d'un grand nombre d'essais chez des individus differents. Toutefois, ces methodes sont difficiles a transposer a une approche clinique ou un seul sujet doit etre examine, du fait d’une forte variabilite inter-individuelle. Ce constat appelle le developpement d'approches plus robustes pour pallier un rapport signal sur bruit extremement defavorable. Les methodes d'apprentissage automatique, en particulier les Machines a Vecteurs de Support (SVM) ont la capacite de distinguer des evenements EEG qui sont difficilement, voire non distinguables, avec les techniques conventionnelles. Elles offrent des lors la possibilite de passer de resultats statistiques au niveau du groupe a un resultat personnalise et par consequent a un diagnostic donne. Nous proposons dans ce travail de these une exploration de la meilleure facon d'extraire les informations pertinentes des enregistrements EEG. Dans un premier temps, nous presentons une revue systematique de la litterature concernant l’application du SVM a l’EEG. Nous mettons en evidence la necessite d’explorer l’ensemble des parametres du SVM et d’extraction des caracteristiques du signal pour une performance optimale et reproductible. Nous etablissons ensuite si les neuromarqueurs de l'apprentissage de nouvelles chansons sont affectes ou non par l'appreciation musicale via une analyse de groupe, dans le cadre du diagnostic differentiel depression et maladie d’Alzheimer. Puis nous appliquons le SVM a nos donnees pour construire des modeles de classification individuels, et nous etudions l’influence de l’optimisation des hyperparametres. Enfin, nous examinons la fiabilite d’un algorithme genetique pour optimiser l’extraction des caracteristiques avant une classification SVM, pour le diagnostic differentiel des etats de conscience pathologiques.",

      "abstract": "The disruption of psychosocial functioning (PSF) is currently listed as one of the DSM IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and PSF is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of successful treatment of the disease. Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

      "title": "SYNGAP1-Related Intellectual Disability",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability (SYNGAP1-ID) is characterized by developmental delay (DD) or intellectual disability (ID) (100% of affected individuals), generalized epilepsy (~84%), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other behavioral abnormalities (≤50%). To date more than 50 individuals with SYNGAP1-ID have been reported. In the majority DD/ID was moderate to severe; in some it was mild. The epilepsy is generalized; a subset of individuals with epilepsy have myoclonic astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome) or epilepsy with myoclonic absences. Behavioral abnormalities can include stereotypic behaviors (e.g., hand flapping, obsessions with certain objects) as well as poor social development. Feeding difficulties can be significant in some. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SYNGAP1-ID is established in a proband with developmental delay or intellectual disability in whom molecular genetic testing identifies either a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SYNGAP1 (~89%) or a deletion of 6p21.3 (~11%). Management Treatment of manifestations: DD/ID are managed as per standard practice. No guidelines are available regarding choice of specific antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In about 50% of patients, the epilepsy responds to a single antiepileptic drug (AED); in the remainder it is pharmacoresistant. Children may qualify for and benefit from interventions used in treatment of ASD. Consultation with a developmental pediatrician may guide parents through appropriate behavioral management strategies and/or provide prescription medications when necessary. Nasogastric/gastrostomy feeding may be required for individuals with persistent feeding issues. Surveillance: Monitor seizure manifestations and control; behavioral issues; developmental progress and educational needs. Genetic counseling SYNGAP1-ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date almost all probands with SYNGAP1-ID whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have had a de novo germline pathogenic variant; however, vertical transmission (from a mildly affected, mosaic parent to the proband) has been reported in one family. Thus, while the risk to sibs appears to be low, it is presumed to be greater than in the general population because of the possibility of germline mosaicism in a parent. Once the SYNGAP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental diseases (NDDs), such as autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and schizophrenia, are characterized by diverse facets of neurological and psychiatric symptoms, differing in etiology, onset and severity. Such symptoms include mental delay, cognitive and language impairments, or restrictions to adaptive and social behavior. Nevertheless, all have in common that critical milestones of brain development are disrupted, leading to functional deficits of the central nervous system and clinical manifestation in child- or adulthood. To approach how the different development-associated neuropathologies can occur and which risk factors or critical processes are involved in provoking higher susceptibility for such diseases, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying proper brain formation is required. NDDs rely on deficits in neuronal identity, proportion or function, whereby a defective development of the cerebral cortex, the seat of higher cognitive functions, is implicated in numerous disorders. Such deficits can be provoked by genetic and environmental factors during corticogenesis. Thereby, epigenetic mechanisms can act as an interface between external stimuli and the genome, since they are known to be responsive to external stimuli also in cortical neurons. In line with that, DNA methylation, histone modifications/variants, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, as well as regulatory non-coding RNAs regulate diverse aspects of neuronal development, and alterations in epigenomic marks have been associated with NDDs of varying phenotypes. Here, we provide an overview of essential steps of mammalian corticogenesis, and discuss the role of epigenetic mechanisms assumed to contribute to pathophysiological aspects of NDDs, when being disrupted.",

      "abstract": "In the 60s of the last century, the terminology discirculatory encephalopathy was proposed, which is defined as a progressive disease that conducts cerebral circulation leading to a gradual deterioration in brain function. Irreversible lesions of the brain parenchyma, against the background of various multifactorial causes, lead to degeneration of brain structures, and subsequently to severe cognitive disorders. DE combines neurological, neuropsychological and mental disorders, in contrast to the term chronic cerebral ischemia, which assumes the presence of one mechanism of damage (l). At one time, cognitive impairments are field-etiological conditions characterized by a decrease in memory and mental performance, with the allocation of a certain level of impairment from mild to severe (dementia or dementia) (k). According to statistics, among neurological patients, moderate cognitive impairment occurs in about 45%. And if mild and moderate disorders can be restored or stabilized to some extent, then dementia is such a pronounced persistent process that interferes not only with social and professional activity, but is characterized by irreversible signs (l). On average, up to 7.5 million new cases of dementia are reported annually, each of which becomes a heavy burden on society. The incidence of dementia increases with age, respectively, an increase in life expectancy, in parallel, increases the numbers of cognitive impairment. In addition, the disease is often combined with many somatic diseases. Therefore, cognitive impairment is an interdisciplinary problem for many specialists and remains relevant, both for establishing a diagnosis and for developing the principles of a modern approach to the rehabilitation of DE patients with cognitive dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "abstract": "The functioning of the brain is affected by the molecular concentrations of many substances that are normally present in the brain. The optimum concentrations of these substances for a person may differ greatly from the concentrations provided by his normal diet and genetic machinery. Biochemical and genetic arguments support the idea that orthomolecular therapy, the provision for the individual person of the optimum concentrations of important normal constituents of the brain, may be the preferred treatment for many mentally ill patients. Mental symptoms of avitaminosis sometimes are observed long before any physical symptoms appear. It is likely that the brain is more sensitive to changes in concentration of vital substances than are other organs and tissues. Moreover, there is the possibility that for some persons the cerebrospinal concentration of a vital substance may be grossly low at the same time that the concentration in the blood and lymph is essentially normal. A physiological abnormality such as decreased permeability of the blood-brain barrier for the vital substance or increased rate of metabolism of the substance in the brain may lead to a cerebral deficiency and to a mental disease. Diseases of this sort may be called localized cerebral deficiency diseases. It is suggested that the genes responsible for abnormalities (deficiencies) in the concentration of vital substances in the brain may be responsible for increased penetrance of the postulated gene for schizophrenia, and that the so-called gene for schizophrenia may itself be a gene that leads to a localized cerebral deficiency in one or more vital substances.",

      "abstract": "Viele Krebspatienten klagen über Gedächtnis- und Konzentrationsprobleme. Bis vor kurzem galten solche Beeinträchtigungen kognitiver Funktionen als Folge der Chemotherapie und das Phänomen erhielt den Namen Chemobrain oder Chemofog. Allerdings lassen sich einige Forschungsergebnisse nicht mit der Annahme vereinbaren, dass kognitive Störungen bei Krebspatienten eine Nebenwirkung der Chemotherapie sind: Die Störungen wurden auch bei Krebspatienten gefunden, die nicht mit Zytostatika behandelt worden waren. Neuere große Studien fanden wenig oder gar keine Anhaltspunkte für negative Effekte einer Chemotherapie auf kognitive Funktionen. Epidemiologische Studien wiesen nach, dass Krebspatienten lebenslang ein erhöhtes Risiko für kognitive Beeinträchtigungen haben, auch wenn sie nicht systemisch behandelt worden sind. Mittlerweile wird deshalb eine multifaktorielle Verursachung der Störungen diskutiert, in der neben verschiedenen Therapien auch die Erkrankung selbst und krankheits- und therapiebedingte Stressbelastungen eine Rolle spielen könnten. Von den Patienten berichtete subjektive kognitive Störungen hängen enger mit dem psychischen Befinden, insbesondere mit Depressivität, als mit neuropsychologisch nachweisbaren Schädigungen kognitiver Funktionen zusammen.",

      "abstract": "Psychopathy rarely forms the basis of an insanity defense, due to its highly prejudicial nature. However, certain characterizations and types of evidence can somewhat reduce this stigma. Undergraduate participants (N = 270) in this mock trial experiment read vignettes describing a fictional murder case in which an insanity defense was raised. These vignettes varied by evidence type (neuroscientific or psychological) and by the defendant’s diagnosis (psychopathy, a brain disease, or psychosis). Participants delivered verdicts and answered questions about sentencing and their perceptions of the defendant. The results indicate that neuroscientific evidence is superior to psychological evidence in establishing a successful insanity defense, while nonsignificant trends suggest that labeling psychopathy as a brain disease may ameliorate the stigma surrounding the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Disruptions in emotional, cognitive, and social behavior are common in neurodegenerative disease and in many forms of psychopathology. Because neurodegenerative diseases have patterns of brain atrophy that are much clearer than those of psychiatric disorders, they may provide a window into the neural bases of common emotional and behavioral symptoms. We discuss five common symptoms that occur in both neurodegenerative disease and psychopathology (i.e., anxiety, dysphoric mood, apathy, disinhibition, and euphoric mood) and their associated neural circuitry. We focus on two neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia) that are common and well characterized in terms of emotion, cognition, and social behavior and in patterns of associated atrophy. Neurodegenerative diseases provide a powerful model system for studying the neural correlates of psychopathological symptoms; this is supported by evidence indicating convergence with psychiatric syndromes (e.g., symptoms of disinhibition associated with dysfunction in orbitofrontal cortex in both frontotemporal dementia and bipolar disorder). We conclude that neurodegenerative diseases can play an important role in future approaches to the assessment, prevention, and treatment of mental illness.",

      "title": "Cognitive impairment in hereditary spherocytosis",
      "abstract": "There is growing evidence that chronic haemolytic anaemias may present with lower cognitive performances both in children and in adults in spite of best clinical practice. Functional impairment might be unnoted even by experienced clinicians but might impact on the quality of life and is revealed by cognitive testing. Most data refer to sickle cell anemia1 and beta-thalassaemia,2 though cognitive deficits have been described also in specific subgroups of Blackfan–Diamond anaemia3 and alpha-thalassaemia.4 The pathogenesis of brain impairment is elusive, probably because causative factors are multiple and likely vary among different anaemias. Strokes and silent vascular-like white matter changes, for example, have shown a causative relationship in sickle cell anemia5 while their role in other haemolytic anaemias seems to be absent or at least questionable.6 In some conditions, genetics seem to be prominent as cognitive impairment is present in specific mutations that lead to abnormal myelination or early atrophy4; in other anaemias, conventional and advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations do not show signs of brain involvement in spite of documented functional impairment.2, 6 In these patients, other factors such as frequent hospitalization since early ages, decreased life expectations and comorbidities might exert some effects on brain development and functioning, rendering the identification of causative factors rather complex. To make this picture more complex, some confounding factors are sometimes endorsed even in contrast with literature evidence. In beta-thalassaemia, for example, some authors7, 8 insist in claiming a role of brain iron overload even though MRI studies9 and, above all, a pathological study10 have denied any increase of iron in the neural tissue and showed no relationship with cognitive impairment.9 So far, no study has investigated cognitive functioning in hereditary spherocytosis (HS, Minkowski–Chauffard disease, #182900), a disease characterized by chronic haemolytic anaemia with splenomegaly, jaundice and spherocytes in peripheral blood films.11 The most severe forms of HS require transfusions since early childhood for preventing multi-organ failure. In these patients, splenectomy is an effective therapeutic option, as it may result in transfusion independence. However, splenectomy may favour a hypercoagulative state with an overall increased risk of thrombosis12, 13 even though adult HS patients do not seem to show increased brain parenchymal vascular lesions compared to age-matched controls (unpublished data). We studied 29 adult HS patients (mean age 34 ± 13.4 years, range 16–67 years; 13 females; mean haemoglobin (Hb) 13.5 ± 1.7 g/dL; platelets (PLT) 376 ± 149.8 x 10^9/L, total bilirubin 1.8 ± 1.3 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 258 ± 73.3 iu/mL; 20 splenectomized, mean age at splenectomy 11.5 ± 6.7 years; for the splenectomized group, mean Hb pre-splenectomy was 9.3 ± 1.7 g/dL, with transfusions every 4.0 ± 3.4 months and pre-transfusion Hb 5.4 ± 0.4 g/dL) by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Fourth Edition (WAIS IV) and standardized scores were considered. The findings were compared with 45 healthy controls (mean age 33.9 ± 10.7 years, range 17–66, 29 females) and a previously studied group of 74 beta-thalassaemia patients (mean age 34.5 ± 10.3, range 16–66, 45 females; 21 non-transfusion-dependent [NTDT], 53 transfusion-dependent [TDT]).2 Most controls were recruited among healthy patients' relatives in order to minimize the effect of different socio-economic backgrounds. For all subgroups, exclusion criteria were a history of concomitant neurological disease, neurosurgery and severe head trauma. The study was approved by our local Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from all participants. The groups did not differ regarding age or sex; education was similar between HS patients (14.7 ± 2.3 years) and controls (15.1 ± 3.9 years) and was higher than subjects with thalassaemia (11.5 ± 2.9 years, p < 0.001). According to testing, the mean Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) was significantly lower in HS than in healthy controls (88.2 ± 17.7 vs. 98.3 ± 13.6; p = 0.005, Mann–Whitney) and slightly though non-significantly better than beta-thalassaemia patients (88.2 ± 17.7 vs. 81.5 ± 13.5; p = 0.099; see Figure 1; Table 1). Subgrouping beta-thalassaemia patients according to their phenotype, cognitive performances of HS patients did not differ from those of NTDT patients (85.9 ± 11.9, p = 0.810) while the scores were higher than those of TDT patients (79.8 ± 13.8; p = 0.039) though the significance did not survive after correction for multiple comparisons. The FSIQ decrease in HS was mainly due to the low scores in the verbal comprehension (88.1 vs. 103, p < 0.001) and processing speed indices (PSI 89.5 vs. 97.3, p = 0.03) (see radar plot in Figure 1B; Table 1), while perceptual reasoning and working memory were less affected. In HS, FSIQ scores did not correlate with the main laboratory findings; however, splenectomized HS patients had a trend of lower FSIQ scores than non-splenectomized ones (85.1 ± 11.4 vs. 95.1 ± 19.4; p = 0.08). In summary, the present pilot study first investigates cognitive functioning in HS patients showing the decreased cognitive performance of HS patients compared to healthy controls, particularly in the FSIQ and Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) measures in spite of an equivalent education level. Even in the absence of severe anaemia, performances were similar to other chronic haemolytic anaemias (such as the non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia subgroup). Among HS patients, splenectomy seems to further stratify cognitive performances suggesting that the main causative factor is not the lifelong red cell anomaly per se but rather the severity of anaemia and the related history of hospitalizations and treatments in the very early phases of life. Even though further research with larger samples is necessary, this study reveals a subgroup of HS patients (namely those with a history of splenectomy) that could benefit from cognitive support. Further genetic and neuroimaging analyses will help identify the structural and functional underpinnings of the preeminent impairment of the Verbal Domain that seems to represent a common feature in both adult HS and thalassaemia patients.

      "title": "Functional neuroimaging: the adaptive mechanisms in migraine",
      "abstract": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by a primary brain dysfunction subtended by an episodic activation and sensitization of the trigemino-vascular pain pathway. Although migraine attacks are clinically welldefined, the underlying pathophysiology of the more complex migraine scenario is largely unknown. Functional brain changes, that occur because of repeated migraine attacks, may be explained through a maladaptive feedforward allostatic cascade model. The fundamental assumption is that “the brain is a central organ of stress” [1], able to detect stressful or potentially stressful situations and react in form of behavioural and/or physiologic responses. These brain responses, mediated by the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine mechanisms, could be either adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, allostasis is the ability to protect the body through adaptation [2]. Contrariwise, the allostatic load and overload, resulting from repeated stress and/or allostasis [3], refers to the wear and tear on the systems that normally support adaptation. Compelling evidence suggests that the brain of migraine patients is significantly different from healthy controls. Some of these differences are related to abnormal cortical activity during painful stimulations, suggesting an “adaptive” response observed in the course of moderate or high noxious trigeminal stimulations. Conversely, other differences relate to abnormality in responses that should be adaptive but become impaired or maladaptive, such as altered brainstem processing. More recently, a decreased functional connectivity was demonstrated within the fronto-parietal network (FPN) in patients with migraine without and with aura in the absence of clinically relevant executive deficits. FPN represents the neural substrate of executive functions and FPN functional abnormalities might be a part of a complex cascade that terminates in a migraine attack. Specifically, FPN functional connectivity changes could underlie a defective executive functioning in which high-demanding conditions cannot be correctly processed and solved by patients with migraine, escalating the brain adaptive response, likely resulting in a risk factor for headache attacks. In conclusion, we believe that in migraine an internal state of dysregulation creates an allostatic load with maladaptive consequences on brain, behaviour, physiological regulation and systemic physiology that progress in a feedforward cascade. Thus, we suggest that migraine should be considered a brain disease and not simply a recurrent acute pain syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Negative symptoms have been considered to be specific to schizophrenia or a subtype of schizophrenia: the deficit syndrome. In other words, these symptoms have been considered to be categorically different from other forms of human behavior and experience, whether they occur in healthy persons or patients with other psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we advocate a dimensional approach to negative symptoms, which is supported by two main arguments. First, enduring negative symptoms can even be observed in a variety of psychiatric disorders and they are not specific to schizophrenia. Second, we review evidence that negative symptoms show a continuous distribution from apparently healthy subjects to those with a fully developed clinical syndrome. Although the evidence does not allow for a definite decision concerning the dimensional distribution of negative symptoms, it certainly justifies exploring a dimensional approach with respect to its clinical and scientific utility. Understanding negative symptoms as a variation of normal mental processes will strengthen the development of neurocognitive models and treatment approaches.",

Nonpathological dissociation is quite common in the general population, however, and may reflect a constitutionally determined cognitive style rather than a pathological trait acquired through the experience of adverse life events. In a theoretical model, we propose that nonpathological dissociation is characterized by high levels of elaboration learning and reconstructive retrieval, for which enhanced levels of attentional and working memory abilities are a prerequisite. These characteristics, in general, seem to be representative for a higher ability to (re-)construct conscious experiences. We review some of our behavioral as well as neural (i.e., fMRI, ERPs) studies, suggesting that high dissociative individuals are characterized by heightened levels of attention, working memory and episodic memory. In nonpathological conditions a person may benefit from these dissociative abilities, although after adverse (e.g., traumatic) events the disposition may develop into dissociative pathology.",

We performed a systematic review for preclinical and human clinical trial evidence to support the use of SSRIs specifically for the management of cognitive decline in AD.(1) PUBMED without language restrictions from 1950s until 2004 and updated August 2006, terms: \"serotonin uptake inhibitors\"[MeSH] AND (\"Alzheimer disease\"[MeSH] OR \"Cognition Disorders\"[MeSH]) NOT \"Parkinson disease\"[MeSH] AND (Clinical Trial[ptyp] OR Letter[ptyp] OR Meta-Analysis[ptyp] OR Randomized Controlled Trial[ptyp]) AND \"alzheimer disease\" [MESH] OR \"Alzheimer*\" combined with AND to \"ssri*\" OR \"serotonin reuptake inhibitors\" [MESH] NOT Review[ptyp]. (2) Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, keywords \"SSRI\" and \"Alzheimer's\".The PubMed search yielded 57 hits. Of these, 23 were included in this review for their specificity to SSRI use in AD or indications on efficacy beyond depressive symptoms. The other 34 citations were excluded because: (1) depression or other mood or behavioral disturbance severity was the reported outcome measure, (2) effects of SSRIs on cognition were confounded by concomitant use of other drugs, (3) subjects described were young adults, and/or (4) subjects had traumatic brain injury. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 3rd Quarter 2006, yielded six citations related to SSRIs.Data extracted from clinical trials included name of SSRI tested, cognitive outcome measures, and adverse events reported, which could include cognitive worsening.Preclinical evidence for use of SSRIs to enhance cognition in AD includes an effect at the hippocampus through carbonic anhydrase activation or stimulation of hippocampal neurogenesis. The chemical structure of paroxetine, and not intrinsic SSRI activity, may also affect APP ectodomain expression to reduce amyloid plaque formation. Clinical trials in AD generally have not assessed cognitive outcomes independently from mood or behavior stabilization. Currently, clinical studies in AD only indirectly support the use of SSRIs for disease modification by confirming a serotonergic deficit during the course of illness.Lack of supportive evidence for SSRIs as cognition enhancers or disease modifiers in AD is the result of omissions in clinical trial design, as opposed to reporting of negative outcomes. The preclinical evidence warrants the study of SSRIs in AD using mood, behavior, cognition, neurochemistry, and possibly neuroimaging as outcome variables.",

      "abstract": "Trigeminal neuralgia, a chronic neuropathic pain, is characterized by frequent episodes of stabbing facial pain, in the territory of the trigeminal nerve, which can severely impair patient’s quality of life. It is primarily caused by vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve root, but it is sometimes secondary to other identifiable neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or a cerebellopontine angle tumor. Uncommonly, it may be caused by the presence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, a condition most likely identified by headache, visual disturbances, and sixth nerve palsy, among other manifestations. Secondary causes of trigeminal neuralgia are usually detected after an atypical clinical manifestation, such as ophthalmic rather than maxillary or mandibular nerve involvement, more than one branch affected, or bilateral symptoms. We present a patient who presented with trigeminal neuralgia as a primary manifestation, and after thorough evaluation she was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension as the underlying mechanism responsible of the trigeminal neuralgia.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter we review several CNS disorders of probable autoimmune origin or of unclear aetiology that sometimes are considered in the differential diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. These syndromes include the CNS complications of systemic autoimmune disorders: IgG4-related disease, Behçet disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and sarcoidosis. In each of them, neurological symptoms may precede the onset of systemic symptoms. Other ‘frontier disorders’ include several diseases associated with primary involvement of the vascular endothelium or blood vessels: cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation, Susac’s syndrome, and primary angiitis of the CNS, which can all present with isolated neurological manifestations. These syndromes are immune-mediated, do not present specific or pathogenic neuronal antibodies, and their diagnosis is based on well-established clinical criteria that sometimes include neuroimaging and histopathological features. The clinical presentation of these syndromes may mimic that of several autoimmune encephalitis: SLE can present with psychosis (thus, it may need the differential diagnosis with anti-NMDAR encephalitis); IgG4-related disease can present with meningoencephalitis; and Behçet disease can present with brainstem dysfunction and neuroimaging findings resembling those of chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids (CLIPPERS). The clinical presentation of primary angiitis of the CNS and Susac syndrome can be indistinguishable from that of autoimmune encephalitis.",

      "title": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders",
      "abstract": "When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends oh our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms arid that if they “got their act together” the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation. This paper presents a brief review of our current understanding of each diagnosis and gives suggestions for management. Curr Open Pediatr 1999, 11375–378 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The clinical evaluation of brain diseases strictly depends on patient’s complaint and observation of their behavior. The specialist, often the neurologist, chooses whether and how to assess cognition, motor system, sensory perception, and autonomic nervous system. They may also decide to request a more in-depth examination, such as neuropsychological and language assessments and imaging or laboratory tests. From the synthesis of all these results, they will be able to make a diagnosis. The neuropsychological assessment in particular is based on the collection of medical history, on the clinical observation, and on the administration of standardized cognitive tests validated in the scientific literature. It is therefore particularly useful when a neurological disease with cognitive and/or behavioral manifestation is suspected. The introduction of machine learning methods in neurology represents an important added value to the evaluation performed by the clinician to increase the diagnostic accuracy, track disease progression, and assess treatment efficacy.",

Como não existem critérios clínicos positivos para as CNEP, não há consenso sobre sua definição, assim como não se tem clareza em relação à nosologia de base, à fisiopatologia e ao tratamento apropriado. As CNEP manifestam-se principalmente por sintomas conversivos e dissociativos, os quais estão ligados historicamente a uma doença considerada de origem traumática, a histeria. Recentemente, observou-se que pacientes com CNEP apresentam taxas elevadas de experiências traumáticas, em particular abuso na infância, e de transtorno de estresse pós-traumático (TEPT). Estes achados sugerem que a CNEP pode ocorrer como expressão clínica de um padrão de TEPT cuja característica central é a predominância de fenômenos dissociativos e conversivos. Algumas evidências levantam a possibilidade de que este subtipo de TEPT dissociativo/conversivo seja resultante de maus cuidados parentais e disfunção familiar na infância, os quais estão associados a - e, portanto podem causar - sintomas somatoformes, incluindo as CNEP. Limitações metodológicas impedem a confirmação destas hipóteses, sendo necessários desenhos de pesquisa mais fortes, tais como prospectivos e de caso-controle.",

Muskelschmerzen (Myalgien) treten in verschiedenen Schweregraden bei bis zu 75 % aller ME/CFS-Patienten auf. Das zentrale Symptom dieser Patienten ist die durch körperliche Anstrengung hervorgerufenen Erschöpfung. Ursprünglich wurde die Erkrankung als Myalgische Enzephalomyelitis beschrieben, als 1955 in Großbritannien plötzlich eine ganze Gruppe von Patienten mit einer mysteriösen ansteckenden Erkrankung entdeckt wurde. Es gibt jedoch keine wissenschaftlichen Beweise für eine Entzündung im Gehirn, daher wird heute die Bezeichnung Chronic Fatigue Syndrom bevorzugt. Fatigue bezeichnet ein Gefühl von körperlicher und geistiger Müdigkeit, das mit reduzierten Energiereserven und Muskelkraft einhergeht. Unter physiologischen Bedingungen wird diese Erschöpfung nach extremer körperlicher oder geistiger Anstrengung als normal und angenehm empfunden. Als Krankheitssymptom tritt sie ohne vorherige Anstrengung auf, und verschwindet auch nach ausreichender Erholungszeit nicht. Fatigue interferiert mit wichtigen Aspekten des täglichen Lebens und kann somit die Lebensqualität der Betroffenen sehr ungünstig beeinflussen (siehe auch Ulrich Rüffer in psychoneuro 2004; 30: 218-220).",

They may be mainly physical, and the patient may present with one or more of a bewildering number of somatic complaints, often blaming those for his change in mood (Watts, 1957). Pain is a common and diagnostically puzzling presenting symptom of depression and other psychiatric disorders (Walters, 1961). It may take the form of generalized or poorly localized aches and pains, often associated with a feeling of tension, or it may be sharply delimited (Critchley, 1935). This form of localized pain may so dominate the symptomatology that the patient is referred by his general practitioner to a variety of specialists, who may perform a series of special investigations or even exploratory operations. Clearly, every effort must be made to exclude organic disease, even if positive signs of psychiatric illness are recognized, as an organic disease can obviously co-exist with a psychiatric one.

The hyper-arousal theory of insomnia postulates that sleep disturbances are caused by an increase in physiological arousal based on the discovery of high physiological arousal, which may be connected to these people's active stress system. Sometimes, sleep issues including difficulties getting asleep, difficulty remaining asleep, or having poor-quality sleep are referred to as insomnia. Insomnia can be brought on by a variety of things, including the use of psychoactive drugs, caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, and cocaine; hormonal changes, such as menstruation and menopause; stressful life events, like the birth of a child and bereavement; disruptions of the circadian rhythm, like shift work and jet lag; some neurological disorders; and medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis. Everything in the universe vibrates at a specific frequency, and when we are in a state of natural resonance, we are in perfect health.

As a disease which directly affects brain cells, it may cause severe psychological and physiological dysfunctions in some of its victims. The principal psychological effects consist of cognitive and affective disturbances. Among cognitive deficites are memory loss and severe difficulty in conceptual reasoning. These deficits are likely to deprive the person affected by the disease of the ability to understand, reason, and elicit deliberate choice. Severe emotional disturbance indicative of a substantial change in personality. Such a change in personality may incapacitate multiple sclerosis victims in several aspects of their intrapsychic and interpersonal life. In marital relationship, a person may be rendered incapable of fulfilling the essential obligations of marriage. The physiological effects which have important juridic consequences are in the area of sexual dysfunctions. If these effects are present at the time of exchanging consent, a marriage court may have to look for possible functional impotence. If the dysfunction becomes evident after the marriage, the only approach seems to be to investigate the possibility of incapacity to assume the perpetuity of the right to sexual intercourse. If this approach is adopted, the basis for this incapacity is to be found in c. 1095, 3°, which requires that the cause of incapacity to assume the essential obligations of marriage be „psychic” in nature. The fact that someone has been diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis does not constitute definitive basis for the juridic conclusion that such a person is inept for or incapable of contracting marriage. The disease affects each person differently and, hence, interpatient variability with regard to physiological effects is inevitable. Therefore, all patients cannot be regarded as lacking in discretion of judgement and/or in their capacity to assume the essential obligations of marriage. Each case is unique and, therefore, each case must be investigated under an appropriate caput or capita nullitatis according to its particular circumstances.",

      "title": "Redefining euthyroidism: A biopsychosocial construct",
      "abstract": "SYMPTOMATIC HEALTH IN THYROID DISORDERS Euthyroidism, in endocrine circles, is defined as \"normal\" thyroid function test values. This construct of biochemical euthyroidism supposedly helps in differentiating \"subclinical\" (? asymptomatic) from \"clinical\" (symptomatic) hypothyroidism. However, persons who seek treatment for thyroid disorders expect much more than biochemical normality from their physicians.[1] Apart from biochemical euthyroidism, patients expect (and deserve) symptomatic relief. Frequently encountered symptoms, such as fatigue, may require extra attention. While hypothyroidism at the cellular and tissue level has been proposed as a possible aetiology for lack of clinical relief, in the setting of biochemical euthyroidism,[2] such symptoms might be due to an associated co-morbid conditions such as anaemia[3] and/or a co-existing autoimmune or rheumatological condition. VISCEROMETABOLIC HEALTH Apart from focusing on clinical improvement and attainment of normalcy of biochemical parameters, the treating endocrinologist has to aim for viscerometabolic relief as well. Thyroid hormones impact the physiology of virtually every organ system, and thyroid dysfunction may lead to other disorders as well. The term \"viscerometabolic euthyroidism\" can be used to describe a state characterized by normal biochemical parameters related to the health of all organ systems which may otherwise be influenced by thyroid dysfunction. Examples of surrogate markers of thyroid function include hemoglobin, transaminase levels, and lipid profile.[3] Thus, a comprehensive biomedical construct of euthyroidism includes alleviation of symptoms achievement and maintenance of biochemical euthyroidism, and optimal viscerometabolism. THYROSTRESS Even this tripronged model of care does not fully represent the needs of many persons living with hypothyroidism. Many patients complain of dissatisfaction with therapy and find it difficult to cope with suoerimposed or concurrent illness. There are significant subtle psycho-somatic implications associated with primary hypothyroidism. Thyro-stress, as we term it, does not necessarily meet the diagnostic criteria of major depressive disorder or anxiety neurosis. It may overlap the clinical features of adjustment disorder. Thyro-stress is defined as an emotional state, characterized by extreme apprehension, discomfort, or dejection caused by the challenges and demand of living with thyroid disorders.[4] The biopsychosocial model of health states that equal attention should be paid to psychological and social health while managing the disease.[5] It is important, therefore, to assess and optimize the mood of persons being treated for thyroid disorders. AWARENESS AND INFORMATION There is ample misinformation regarding thyroid health in the community and on social media. This has to be addressed through individual thyroid counseling and quinary prevention[67] which is the concept of preventing health-related fake news or misinformation or preventing the impact of misinformation on human health. Specific concerns, such as fear of infertility, or fear of cancer, must be addressed. Issues raised by relative and other close ones, for example, fear of communicability of thyroid disease, or risk of vertical transmission from mother to offspring, must be clarified as well. Thus, psychological and social modulation should occur together. These can be facilitated by proper communication between health-care providers, their patients, and the community at large. COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH Although the management of hypothyroidism appears simple, it is far from so. The choice of initial dose of thyroxine, its monitoring, and titration are just one aspect of thyroid management. It is not enough to target just biochemical euthyroidism. While only evidence-backed and evidence-approved therapy must be used to keep thyroid levels normal, other aspects of health must also be addressed. A comprehensive definition of euthyroidism, which includes symptomatic cure, biochemical euthyroidism, viscerometabolic optimization, and psychological well-being, along with the creation of a thyroid-friendly social environment, should be aimed for [Table 1]. Measurement and monitoring of thyroid hormones should be accompanied by assessment and addressal of symptoms, surrogate markers of hypothyroidism, and well-being.Table 1: Domains of euthyroidismOnly when we define euthyroidism correctly, and measure it from all dimensions of the biopsychosocial model of health, will we be able to achieve our goal of providing health to all persons living with thyroid disease.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder where the body attacks its own insulating myelin sheaths covering the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. MS patients show signs of mental illness via emotional blunting, liability, apathy, depression, irritability, and psychosis. Many psychiatrists have noted that the symptomatology of mood disorder is very similar to early signs of MS. The mechanism behind the relationship of depression with MS is not entirely understood at this point. However, through advancements in medical imaging techniques, there are now some leading explanations. One main explanation suggests that depression and memory disturbance are correlated to the demyelination within the limbic system caused by MS. Studies showed that following a diagnosis of MS, the rates of depression are significantly elevated in patients. Several studies noted a lifetime prevalence of major depression in >50% of MS patients. These studies foreshadow that depression is a very important clinical harbinger of active demyelination in MS patients. Depression may hint at which subgroup or stage the MS patient is in, without needing to wait for dramatic physical signs or symptoms to commence. Future physicians may be able to use depression as a prodrome for multiple sclerosis and narrow down the prognosis of their patients, treating them earlier.",

      "abstract": "Determining the prognosis in nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is complicated by several factors: under-recognition of NCSE with its spontaneous resolution (thus decreasing the \"denominator\" of total cases that will have a poor outcome); incorrect diagnosis of NCSE based on misinterpretation of EEG \"epileptiform\" activity; mis-classification of certain EEG patterns as NCSE (e.g. PLEDs; triphasic waves); and grouping of different populations that have markedly different co-morbidities (ambulatory patients with NCSE together with comatose patients with electrographic seizure activity on EEG). There are almost no prospective studies with premorbid neuropsychometric studies, and retrospective studies typically include isolated cases, or case series that include conditions in which the cause of NCSE itself causes cognitive morbidity. To summarize available data, absence status (ambulatory generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus) would appear to carry no lasting morbidity. Complex partial status epilepticus in ambulatory patients rarely results in measurable permanent neurologic deficit, although rarely, short or long-standing deficits may clearly occur. Because intensive treatment with intravenous anticonvulsants (e.g. benzodiazepines or phenytoin) can confer morbidity, the equation has not yet been made as to whether the morbidity of such intensive treatment for all cases of NCSE exceeds the morbidity of the disease itself. Larger, prospective studies will be needed to truly determine the prognosis in the different types of NCSE, stratified according to associated degrees of impairment (minimally impaired, moderately obtunded, comatose).",

Epilepsy is the most common neurological disease in children, and its etiology is diverse.

Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) change neuronal functioning by design but do not change the underlying disease. As with many medications, the AEDs impact targeted symptoms as well as other neurocognitive and physiological processes (i.e., side effects). Children and adolescents with chronic medical conditions are generally at increased risk of adjustment difficulties. A school neurocognitive evaluation of a student with epilepsy will require more preparation than a typical psychoeducational evaluation.

      "title": "Cautious optimism for the future of migraine treatment",
      "abstract": "Progress on migraine research, and chronic pain research more generally, has been hampered by lack of an easily measurable biomarker. A biomarker that has sufficient sensitivity and specificity not only allows the diagnosis of disease, but also facilitates a measure of treatment response. The role of biomarkers, both radiological and biochemical, has transformed many areas of medicine for chronic disease. In neurology, for example, magnetic resonance imaging allowed the development of the McDonald criteria for multiple sclerosis,1 and later allowed clinicians and researchers to detect not only clinical, but also radiological progression of disease, both in the form of new demyelinating lesions, and more recently in the form of volumetric loss.2, 3 Unfortunately, a proven biomarker is lacking in many chronic pain conditions. This absence of a physical or biochemical indicator, and the subjective nature of pain, often means that the suffering associated with chronic pain is minimised or ignored at a clinician level. Some fatalism associated with a lack of effective therapy can also enter the problem, and these individuals can often be viewed as ‘heart-sink’ patients. This is not peculiar to headache. Nevertheless, it is beholden on us as physicians to not only treat physical disease, but also to treat the illness and suffering of patients and address it within a biopsychosocial framework. Migraine and headache in general are the second most common of these pain conditions (after back pain). Migraine is a condition affecting 14% of people in the world, causing significant morbidity, particularly to those of working age.4 It is the second most common cause of years lived with disability as calculated in the Global Burden of Disease (2019).5 In people aged <50 years, headache disorders are the most common cause of global disability in terms of years lived with disability.6 This leads to significant lost productivity, due to absenteeism.7 Although people with migraine may attend work despite a headache, their productivity may be suboptimal.8 This lost productivity despite attendance is termed presenteeism.9 In 2018, Deloitte Access Economics, in conjunction with Novartis, produced a white paper to evaluate the impact of migraine in Australia.10 It estimated that approximately 4.8 million Australians were affected by migraine. The cost of migraine to the Australian society was A$35.7 billion. Australian gross domestic product (GDP) that year was A$1920 billion, making the relative cost 1.86% of that year's annual GDP. Historically, and relative to other diseases, migraine has not received a level of research or clinical interest commensurate with the aforementioned burden. This may relate to the lack of presentation to general practitioners, lack of referral to tertiary neurological care, or a lack of interest and therapeutic nihilism on the part of some specialists. At present, only one headache fellowship is available to neurology trainees in Australia. While it could be argued that this reflects that care is primarily in the outpatient or private setting, the care for neuroimmunological conditions such as multiple sclerosis is similarly outpatient based, and there are at least five fellowships available in that subspecialty in comparison. Fortunately, things may be changing and interest in headache as a subspecialty is growing, including membership of the Australia and New Zealand Headache Society. This has been spurred by the excitement surrounding the recent addition of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors to the therapeutic armamentarium. CGRP was first identified as a putative nociceptive peptide back in 1988 by Goadsby, an Australian researcher, and his colleagues.11 CGRP levels were later found to rise in spontaneous migraine12 and exogenous CGRP could induce a migraine attack.13, 14 CGRP is one of several nociceptive peptides isolated from the trigeminovascular system. CGRP is expressed in both Aδ and c fibre projections from the trigeminal ganglion. Both botulinum toxin and sumatriptan have been shown to block some CGRP-mediated migraine attacks. Botulinum toxin has been available for some time now for the prevention of migraine, and its mode of action is felt to be due to CGRP modulation on pain fibres that are co-localised to the nodes of Ranvier on larger somatic fibres. It suppresses CGRP levels, and also acts on glutamate, substance P and neuropeptide Y.15-17 The 37-amino acid CGRP binds with a G-protein coupled receptor, and is expressed throughout the nervous system, as well as peripherally in the enteric nervous system and vasculature. Development of both small peptide blockers of CGRP (the ‘-gepants’) and monoclonal antibodies against CGRP itself or its canonical receptor have ushered in a new class of migraine therapeutics. In this issue, Eller and Cheng describe the current state of migraine therapeutics, with a particular emphasis on the current CGRP inhibitors currently in use.18 In monoclonal antibody form, there is erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab and eptinezumab. The authors outline how and when to use specific therapies and how these therapies may improve the lives of our patients who suffer debilitating chronic migraine. Both fremanezumab and galcanezumab have been approved for use in chronic migraine under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS); erenumab and eptinezumab are available on private prescription. The last is an infusion therapy and the rest subcutaneous injectables. These medications have had significant benefits for chronic migraine sufferers in Australia and worldwide.19 There remains a wide variation in response, and we are some way from a personalised migraine therapeutic regimen, since CGRP is a poor biomarker candidate, owing to low peripheral blood levels and short half-life.20 On a positive note, CGRP inhibitors have been found to work quickly21 and a person's likely therapeutic benefit will be known within the first 3 months of use. The CGRP inhibitors seem to have a relatively minor side-effect profile, whereas other migraine prophylactic agents are often ceased due to side-effects.22 Vasoconstriction concerns were not realised, even in a coronary disease population. As with other fields at the forefront of biotechnological innovation, these medicines come at a cost. The authors describe how and when these new medications can be used within the confines of the PBS listing. Erenumab was withdrawn from PBS application, with some indication that its evidence for cost effectiveness was insufficient. In the UK, a similar body to the PBS exists known as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Somewhat at odds with the PBS decision, it has approved use of erenumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab for both chronic and high frequency episodic migraine. Whether this difference relates to the two countries' different cost-benefit analyses or with their opaque price negotiations with the drug companies is a point of speculation, since presumably the efficacy data available are the same. With migraine such a common (and underdiagnosed) problem, and particularly without an objective biomarker, the use of these therapies may grow much more than expected. A similar issue occurred following the licensing of botulinum toxin for use in chronic migraine, where PBS forecasting underestimated the ongoing use of this therapy, resulting in a significant burden of cost on the state and therefore the taxpayer.23 This may ultimately be behind the government strategy of cost-sharing between the available monoclonal therapies. As doctors, we must not only be the best advocate for the patient sitting in front of us, but also for all the hypothetical patients that present in the future. We should be conscientious about how much our different treatments cost the government, since there are limitations on how much can be spent on healthcare. Not infrequently, the law of diminishing returns applies when it comes to quality-of-life improvements. We must be diligent in ensuring that the treatments we prescribe and administer to our patients are the ones that are most likely to be clinically effective as well as cost-effective. In the field of migraine, this includes simple, evidence-based lifestyle measures such as dietary, sleep and exercise advice, avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol, as well as appropriate pharmaceutical treatment, including measures to avoid medication-overuse headache. We should retain these new medications for those who have failed more simple measures and drugs. This is not only to prevent unnecessary expenditure, but also in case of hitherto unforeseen side-effects. Despite a benign side-effect profile in clinical trials, CGRP is a ubiquitous peptide, and off-target side-effects may be revealed in the future.24 Post-marketing surveillance will be important, and clinicians are encouraged to continue to follow up their patients with diligence.",

Prolonged exposure to stressors, particularly during early life, is strongly associated with later psychiatric disorders. Underlying mechanistic connections between stress responses and development of psychiatric illnesses remain uncertain and typically appear to be nonspecific. Relevant candidate mechanisms are likely to include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, marked by sustained excessive release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. In turn, this process is influenced by and alters various central neurotransmitter and other molecular signaling systems that include glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and neurotrophic peptides. Additional manifestations of stress include altered neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, as well as oxidative neuron-damaging effects. The complex molecular systems involved in these processes present many opportunities for innovative pharmacological interventions that may have preventive or therapeutic benefits regarding mental illnesses arising from stress.",

Acidentes graves tambem sao propiciadores da perda visual. Deficiencia em um importante sentido como a visao leva a pessoa a reconfiguracao da autoimagem, assim como a reestruturacao de seus papeis sociais, resultando em uma transicao psicossocial similar a de uma pessoa que perde um ente querido. Estudos recentes ressaltam que o luto e uma reacao esperada para diversos tipos de perda, conferindo ao luto um carater oscilatorio, no qual o enlutado transita entre ficar voltado para a perda sofrida, ou para o enfrentamento dela. Tal compreensao do carater oscilatorio confere ao luto caracteristicas peculiares a cada experiencia de enlutamento. Quando nao se confere ao enlutado o direito de expressar de sua propria maneira e em seu tempo tais singularidades, corre-se o risco de faze-lo passar por uma experiencia de luto nao reconhecido, podendo este ser um sofrimento adicional aquele ja vivido pela pessoa que enfrenta a dor de um evento estressor.

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

      "title": "[Cognitive and behavioral consequences of epilepsy during the course of brain development].",
      "abstract": "The notion that cognitive and behavioural dysfunctions of epileptic origin can be prolonged and with an insidious onset, has meant a radical conceptual change about epilepsy considered so far uniquely as a paroxysmal disorder. Also, these dysfunctions can be the only observable manifestations of the disorder. It is particularly true in some epileptic syndromes with onset in childhood. Epileptic dysfunctions are characterized by a discontinuity in time (intermittent, recurrent), in space (cerebral localization of the dysfunction and its spread). They often have a significant relationship with sleep. These features, with sometimes the existential dimension of some symptoms (intermittent loss of the flux of consciousness, intermittent perceptual distortions or cognitive-emotional dysfunction) are not seen in any other congenital or acquired disorders of the human brain. Longitudinal clinical studies in which the epileptic variable can be directly correlated with the precise study of the cognitive dysfunction (also with increasingly complex methods of brain imaging) are a difficult, relatively new multidisciplinary task, especially in the very young child. Case examples of children followed from early childhood to adulthood will illustrate the diversity of observed cognitive and behavioural abnormalities directly caused by the epileptic activity which can be massive or very discrete. One is only beginning to document precisely the late consequences (or absence of) of some early childhood epilepsies that had a direct impact on developing brain function at some point.",

It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease.

A highly differenciated diagnostic effort is required as sleep in children is extremely variable between individuals, undergoes a constant matural development and depends of cultural influences on sleep behavior. The pathogenesis is predominantely due to environmental variables, especially to the child-parent interaction. Besides somatic diseases, as Sleep Related Breathing Disorders, Restless legs syndrome and nocturnal seizures play an etiologic role. Psychological and somatic factors in the development of sleep disorders have in common that they exercise a serious negative impact on cognitive daytime functioning and behavior. In this paper the interdependence of somatic and psychological factors and the relations between disturbed nighttime sleep and impaired daytime functioning will be discussed. Especially in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder these relations can be demonstrated.

The most important diagnostic tool is the history. The examination is very often normal unless the patient has a structural brain lesion. The history should include the following information:• The presence or absence of an aura, which is a recurrent stereotypic abnormal sensation or experience. The aura is a simple partial seizure or focal seizure without impairment of consciousness or awareness according to the newly proposed classification of seizures and epilepsies [6].",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

      "abstract": "One of the reasons for the development or worsening of cognitive impairment (CI) may be the use of a number of drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, glucocorticosteroids, antitumor drugs and a number of others. The negative effect of drugs on cognitive functions is realized due to many pathophysiological mechanisms: disruption of hormonal regulation, decreased neuronal excitability, increased activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, decreased cerebral circulation, atrophic changes in the brain; many mechanisms have not been fully established. Risk factors for the development of drug-induced CIs are: old age or childhood, brain damage, chronic diseases, genetic factors, the patient's initial CI, polypharmacy, dose and duration of drug use, acute infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, dehydration, acute urinary retention, etc. To diagnose and differentially diagnose drug-induced CI, it is necessary to establish a connection between the start of taking a suspected drug-inducer and a decrease in cognitive functions. The first step in the treatment of drug-induced CI is the abolition of an inducer drug or a reduction in its dose, in cases where it is impossible to discontinue the drug and there is no replacement, special slow-release dosage forms can be considered. The main measures to prevent drug-induced CI include the use of drugs with the lowest risk of their development, assessment of drug interactions, and the use of modern scales to assess the risk of developing this side-effect (anticholinergic burden scale, etc.).",

      "title": "Dementia and criminal justice",
      "abstract": "Overview This chapter addresses dementia in the context of criminal behavior by, or directed toward, the person with dementia. It is likely that the individual would be said to be “looking normal,” because it is not easily detected or immediately discernable that an individual person's mental condition was the product of the degenerative brain conditions which are collectively known as dementia. Unlike an inability to walk or an inability to see objects, dementia in a patient is not perceptible by the average person under normal circumstances. The brain's degenerative condition which makes the person less able to control their actions may lead to a confirmed diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia after neuropsychological tests and/or expensive and complex brain scans are performed. Many studies have been offered and debated on this issue. It is possible that a defendant between ages 40 and 70 might claim that her or his conduct was the result of early onset dementia. This can be determined by standard forensic psychological assessment testing. It may be augmented by electronic CT or MRI brain scanning and evaluation of brain plaque conditions. Not all dementia claims are valid, of course. “Other problems that may be mistakenly labeled dementia include delirium, psychosis, depression, and the side effects of various medications.” But it would be rare for a criminal defendant to have solid, persuasive factual brain imaging diagnostic data that would survive critical cross-examination. A claim of mental disease or defect may be attempted, but to the extent that the claims reflect alcoholism, drug use or other transitory impairment of consciousness about behavior, the dementia claim is unlikely to be successful. The defense case against a criminal charge requires expert witnesses who would testify about their examination of the defendant. Then they would testify that for a patient with frontotemporal dementia, the brain is losing “filters” of sound, prudent judgment. So the loss of inhibitions and scrambled reasoning is a problem that may involve the uninhibited patient in criminal incidents, as actor or victim. The patient is missing the normal social inhibition against doing an action that would be adverse, and their brain is not presently aware that it is wrong to do that action.",

      "title": "NEUROMUSCULAR COMPLICATIONS OF CRITICAL ILLNESS",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Neuromuscular weakness is common in the setting of critical illness. Over the past two decades, it has been recognized that polyneuropathy or myopathy may develop de novo as a complication of the underlying illness, sepsis, or the medical therapies. This weakness complicates recovery and often contributes to prolonged ventilator dependence. REVIEW SUMMARY The neuromuscular complications of critical illness include critical illness polyneuropathy, an acute myopathy, and prolonged pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade. As a complication of critical illness and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (usually produced by sepsis), an axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy may be seen. A myopathy, often called acute quadriplegic myopathy, may develop in a similar setting, often in association with the use of corticosteroids and/or nondepolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs). Weakness in this latter disorder may result from electrical inexcitability of muscle due to altered membrane sodium channels with reduced sodium currents and loss of myosin thick filament. Some patients, particularly those with abnormal renal or hepatic function, may have prolonged weakness for as long as one week after the use of NMBAs. This large, heterogeneous group of patients are difficult to evaluate due to the limitations imposed by the critical care setting and may have critical illness polyneuropathy, acute quadriplegic myopathy, or both. CONCLUSIONS Neuromuscular weakness may occur in association with a combination of risk factors, including sepsis and multiorgan failure (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), high-dose corticosteroids, and NMBAs. This may take the form of an axonal polyneuropathy, an acute myopathy, or both.",

      "title": "Moderating Effect of Cognitive Reserve on Brain Integrity and Cognitive Performance",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is arguably the most devastating condition of older adulthood with treatment options still elusive. Alzheimer’s is the most prevalent form of dementia where cognitive deficits relate strongly to underlying brain pathology. However, there exist cases in which cognitive performance does not match the corresponding level of neuropathology. Attempts to explain this phenomenon often include the concept of cognitive reserve (CR), whereby greater CR (e.g., more education or higher occupational position) presumably results in less impairment relative to the extent of pathology early in disease progression but also greater impairment once cognitive symptoms manifest. We examined the influence of CR proxy variables (education and occupation) on the relationship between hippocampal volume and cognitive performance on tests of executive control and memory using data from the Czech Brain Aging Study (CBAS). Participants were cognitively normal/with subjective cognitive decline but without actual impairment (CN; n=115; M(age)=66.43; M(education)=15.90; 37 men) or had amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; n=165; M(age)=71.37; M(education)=14.92; 85 men). We found that hippocampal volume was significantly related to executive control (b=-.0001, p=.03) and memory (b=.0002, p&amp;lt;.001) for participants with aMCI, but only memory (b=.0002, p=.03) for CN participants. Occupational position moderated the association between memory and hippocampal volume in aMCI, with the result approaching significance (p=.07), whereby a greater link between memory problems and hippocampal atrophy was present in those previously in high occupational positions. No other moderations for occupational position or education emerged (ps&amp;gt;.25). We found evidence for the concept of CR using occupational position as proxy.",

      "title": "Es la edad de inicio del trastorno bipolar un buen marcador de dos entidades distintas",
      "abstract": "Antecedentes: Una de las lineas existentes en el\r\nestudio de las enfermedades mentales, trata de\r\nclasificar subtipos clinicos distintos en base a\r\nsu origen primario o secundario. El trastorno\r\nbipolar de inicio tardio presenta caracteristicas\r\nfenotipicas distintas a los pacientes que inician la\r\nenfermedad sobre la segunda-tercera decadas de\r\nla vida, especialmente una mayor comorbilidad\r\ncon otras enfermedades organicas, principalmente\r\nneurovascular, y una alta prevalencia de\r\nfactores de riesgo cardiovascular (FRCV). Metodos:\r\nSe reclutaron pacientes con diagnostico de\r\nTrastorno Bipolar ingresados en una unidad de\r\nagudos del Complejo Hospitalario de Santiago\r\nde Compostela con un primer episodio indice\r\n(mania o depresion mayor) despues de los 40\r\nanos. Recopilamos mediante historia clinica y\r\nentrevista, numerosos datos clinicos - sexo, edad\r\nde inicio de enfermedad, antecedentes personales\r\npsiquiatricos, antecedentes familiares de trastornos\r\nafectivos y/o psicoticos, enfermedades “somaticas”,\r\nFRCV, naturaleza de episodio indice,\r\nclinica psicotica, duracion del ingreso, numero\r\nde ingresos previos, alteraciones en pruebas de\r\nneuroimagen, y necesidad de TEC. Resultados:\r\nconseguimos 22 pacientes con una edad de inicio\r\nentre 40 y 74 anos, con media de 58 anos. La\r\ndistribucion entre sexo y edad fue homogenea\r\ny no se observaron diferencias para la edad de\r\ninicio respecto genero. Un 68,2% tenia al menos\r\nuna patologia organica, el numero de FRCV se\r\nsituo en 1,6, siendo la hiperlipidemias (54,5%)\r\ny Diabetes Mellitus (45,5%) las mas frecuentes.\r\nSin antecedentes familiares un 63,6%, ningun\r\nantecedente personal psiquiatrico (a excepcion\r\nde abuso de substancias) un 59,1%. Los hombres\r\npresentaron mas abuso de OH (p=0.019) que\r\nlas mujeres. Conclusiones: nuestro estudio pone de\r\nrelevancia la importancia de aclarar la verdadera\r\ninfluencia de los factores organicos en pacientes\r\nLOB, donde destaca su alta prevalencia. Esto\r\npermitiria depurar mas los diagnosticos de TB,\r\ny producir estudios geneticos mas homogeneos\r\nen el futuro, sin la interferencia de pacientes con\r\nenfermedad secundaria.",

      "title": "Diagnosis of Brain Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Neurological assessment of critically ill patients requires physical examination although coexisting cognitive impairment, sedative or paralytic medication, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular weakness, injuries or surgery involving extracranial tissues may limit sensitivity and specificity of findings. Notwithstanding these constraints, neurological signs and syndromes are valuable indicators of severity of illness and prognosis. Common neurologic syndromes in ICU patients include disturbances in the level of arousal and in cognition, delirium, seizures, generalized weakness, and focal neurological deficits. Whenever possible, neurological examination should include an assessment of mental status, attention, cranial nerves, motor and sensory findings. If there is persisting diagnostic uncertainty additional testing should be sought. Computed tomography of the head should be obtained whenever there is a new onset of seizures, focal neurologic deficits, alteration of mental status or loss of consciousness which are not immediately reversible or explainable. Magnetic resonance imaging has greater sensitivity for demyelinating and inflammatory diseases, hyperacute ischemic stroke, microhemorrhagic lesions, anoxic-ischemic damage, and disorders affecting the white matter and the brainstem. Electroencephalography is needed if seizures or status epilepticus are suspected as a cause or consequence of acute brain dysfunction. Somatosensory evoked potentials, best studied in patients with anoxic brain injury may help with prognostication following cardiac arrest. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocities should be obtained when neuromuscular weakness is severe or cannot be assessed clinically.",

The distinction between accidental and nonaccidental patterns of injury is the crux of the issue in examining a deceased infant with clinical or autopsy evidence of trauma, and will be the focus of this chapter. Penetrating projectile and sharp force injury to the brain and spinal cord are sufficiently rare as to be outside the scope of this discussion. Likewise, deaths due to suffocation, drowning, and arson are not covered here, in part because neuropathologic changes are not specific (see Table 65.1).",

      "title": "Mixed pathologies of the ageing and neurodegenerating brain",
      "abstract": "It becomes increasingly clear that brains of elderly individuals frequently show multiple neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathologies rather than hallmark lesions of only one disease. This phenomenon has been variably and inconsistently referred to as multimorbidity, comorbidity, concomitant pathology, multiple pathologies, mixed pathology and mixed dementia. Here, we generally refer to this phenomenon as mixed pathology, which includes various combinations of all known neurodegenerative proteinopathies as well as combinations of the latter and other cerebral diseases such as cerebrovascular disease (CVD), irrespective of their severity.3,56 If the severity of a distinct pathology is so low that it would not cause any clinical symptoms, it is referred to as concomitant pathology. Mixed pathology is frequent, but the respective burden and topographical distribution of each distinct hallmark pathology determines its contribution to the clinical syndrome. Accordingly, three subgroups of mixed pathology can be distinguished (Figure 34.1): Low-level concomitant pathologies in brains of elderly individuals without any clinical symptoms One severe pathology that can be interpreted as a morphological substrate underlying the clinical syndrome together with additional low level concomitant pathology that would not cause any symptoms on its own (e.g. Alzheimer's disease [AD] with minor cerebrovascular lesions or progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP] with Lewy bodies limited to the medulla oblongata) Presence of two (or more) distinct disease hallmark pathologies that are so severe that any one of these could independently cause clinical symptoms, usually cognitive impairment but also movement disorder4 (e.g. mixed AD/dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB])106 Figure 34.1 Defining mixed pathology. The ageing and neuro-degenerating brain is characterised by mixed pathology, which can consist of several low-level concomitant pathologies (no clinical symptoms), one main severe pathology with additional low-level concomitant pathologies or two (or more) severe pathologies with or without additional concomitant pathologies. * Only this group is the neuropathological correlate of mixed dementia. https://s3-euw1-ap-pe-df-pch-content-public-p.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/9781003389699/527a0159-4926-424f-88e3-0f9f8efc4e53/content/fig34_1_34.jpg\" xmlns:xlink=\"https://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"/> Only the third subgroup of mixed pathology would be the neuropathological correlate of a true mixed dementia clinical syndrome. The term mixed dementia should not be used in the context of group 2, as this is so frequent that virtually all cases could be classified as mixed dementia. This is not appropriate since here the hallmark pathology of only one disease is severe enough to explain the clinical dementia.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

With new disease entities, causal associations are relatively easily established when the condition is serious, verifiable, and has excess disease rates in specific groups. In common conditions, many excess cases are required to establish association with a specific exposure. Establishing causality in syndromes with variable symptoms is difficult because specific diagnostic algorithms must be established before causal factors can be properly investigated. Searching for an environmental cause is futile in the absence of an operational disease case definition. Common subjective symptoms (without objective physical or laboratory findings) account for over one-half of all medical outpatient visits, yet these symptoms lack an identified physical cause at least one-third of the time.

      "abstract": "Although occupational stress is a very common reality for many workers, we have to admit that some professions generate a higher level of distress as, for example, management roles, night shift working, monotonous jobs, communitarian services, heavy industry sector, mining, construction, etc. Chronic stress can disrupt behaviours (like foods habits) of those persons who suffer it.At the same time, and in a contrary manner, eating disorders can also trigger different types of stress linked pathologies.For the above mentioned reasons, it is not strange that the digestive system becomes in a target of stress' pathologies, especially associated with negative work environments.In some circumstances, there is a dissociation between the appetite, (primarily psychic sensation), and the hanger, (basically organic sensation).The appetite as a mental status can be altered substantially by many different emotional situations (like occupational stress) or throughout chemical and vascular variations as well as organic impulses transmitted to midbrain from different organs where the stress could also play a very relevant role.Nutrition depends essentially on of food habits, but at the same time, a very important source of stress is the way in which we eat, because if we do it wrongly, we can become ill.If our cells don't receive the correct nutrients a very high level of stress is produced due to this dissatisfied internal demand.",

      "abstract": "Accurate certification of deaths in custody that occur either during or immediately following contact with law enforcement personnel (especially physical contact) involves consideration of one or more modalities of contact. These modalities include physical restraint (hand/ankle cuffing, prone positioning, application of pressure on the torso and/or limbs, maximal prone restraint, application of conducted electrical weapons) and chemical restraints (lacrimal agents/chemical irritants) in the setting of psychotic illness/agitation, struggle/physical exertion, intoxication with stimulant drugs and underlying cardiovascular pathology that can predispose to sudden death. Assessment of these case are often not straightforward, and their certification can be some of the most difficult cases that a forensic pathologist can be faced with in respect to the determination of both cause manner of death. Perceived unfair and/or unpopular certifications of these cases can result in professional criticism, allegations of bias, complicity or bias by certifying pathologist, social dissatisfaction/unrest and violent public protests. Recent deaths in custody in the United States (US) are typical examples of this phenomenon. This Chapter outlines the main clinicopathologic considerations that must occur in the pathologic assessment of these cases",

The minor decline in abilities is noticeable by the person experiencing them or by others who interact with the person, but the changes are not severe enough to interfere with normal daily life and activities. Some gradual mental decline is seen with normal aging. For example, the ability to learn new information may be reduced, mental processing slows, speed of performance slows, and ability to become distracted increases. However, these declines due to normal aging do not affect overall functioning or ability to perform activities of daily living.",

      "title": "Genetics of Epileptic Encephalopathies",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epileptic encephalopathy (EE) is a descriptive term for a group of severe epilepsy disorders characterised predominantly by early onset drug‐resistant seizures, accompanied by developmental stagnation or regression secondary to epileptiform activity. The aetiological diagnosis of EE is challenging, as causes are numerous with significant phenotypic overlap: these include acquired causes as well as numerous de novo or inherited monogenic seizure disorders, genetic inborn errors of metabolism, intellectual disability syndromes and chromosomal aberrations. A diagnostic pathway should include consultation with a Paediatric Neurologist and Clinical Geneticist, screening for immediately treatable causes, neuroimaging and electroencephalogram (EEG) and genetic testing including chromosomal microarray and consideration of a next generation sequencing technique that can interrogate multiple genetic causes, such as a multigene panel, or exome/genome sequencing. Understanding the underlying genetic cause of EE can allow accurate genetic counselling for the family and providing personalised management and support. Key Concepts EE is a descriptive term for a group of disorders where epileptiform activity itself contributes to severe cognitive and behavioural impairments above and beyond what might be expected from the underlying pathology. Although EE can be acquired, most cases of previously considered cryptogenic EE are now recognised to be due to single gene disorders. The majority of monogenic EE are due to de novo pathogenic variants: however, up to 10% of EE may be due to X‐linked or autosomal recessive conditions, with higher rates in populations where consanguineous marriage is more common. Although there are some genotype/phenotype correlations, a single genetic cause can result in a variety of EE and non‐EE phenotypes, and each subtype of EE can have a variety of genetic causes. Genetic heterogeneity in EE limits the value of targeted genetic testing. An optimal, cost‐effective diagnostic approach involves first‐tier tests that target common and treatable conditions, followed by second‐tier tests including sequencing of a panel of genes known to cause EE or exome/whole genome sequencing to allow genome‐wide interrogation. Factors influencing choice of type of genetic test (multigene panel versus exome/genome sequencing) include epilepsy semiology, developmental regression, additional neurological or extra‐cerebral manifestations, family history and clinician and patient choice and cost. Phenotypic factors that suggest exome/genome sequencing may be valuable and include developmental regression and progressive features, multiorgan involvement including dysmorphism, additional neurological features and cerebral malformations. Evaluation of the likely pathogenicity of a novel genetic variant should include consideration of similarity with the types of genetic variants previously identified as causal of EE for that gene, including which functional domain(s) are implicated as well as overlap with the associated clinical features previously described for that condition. For variants remaining of uncertain clinical significance, ongoing pathogenicity assessment will be required in the light of advances in the understanding of the genetics of EE.",

Brain imaging and neurophysiology studies have helped demonstrate multiple areas and aspects of brain dysfunction, implicating a disruption of physiological \"networks.\" Disorders of energy metabolism, immune regulation, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and the autonomic nervous system are also theorized to participate in the pathogenesis. Other markers of fatigue include findings on polysomnography and tests of vigilance and attention. Nonpharmacologic treatments include energy conservation, cooling, exercise, rehabilitation therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, electromagnetic maneuvers, and mindfulness techniques.

The main symptom is loss of vision (visual acuity and visual field damages), with colors appearing subtly washed out in the affected eye. The diagnosis is made on clinical examination. The history often points to the possible etiology of the optic neuropathy. In most of the cases, one eye is affected but it could be both. A rapid onset is typical of demyelinating, inflammatory, ischemic, and traumatic causes. A gradual course points to compressive, toxic/nutritional, and hereditary causes. The classic clinical signs of optic neuropathy are visual acuity and field defects, dyschromatopsia, and abnormal pupillary response. There are ancillary investigations that can support the diagnosis of optic neuropathy. Visual field testing, neuroimaging of the brain and orbit are essential in many optic neuropathies including demyelinating and compressive. In the last decade, increase of use new technology for optic neuropathies evaluation including multifocal visual evoked potentials and optic coherence tomography. Long standing of optic neuropathy is described by pale optic disk or optic atrophy, which means damage and death of these nerve cells or neurons.",

      "abstract": "Se revisa la iconografía de los hallazgos por tomografía computada (TC) y resonancia magnética (RM) de la cefalea, según nuestra experiencia. De acuerdo con la base MESH, esta entidad se define como un dolor craneano, que puede ser de ocurrencia benigna o la manifestación de una amplia gama de desórdenes. Las cefaleas se clasifican por su evolución temporal (aguda o crónica), presentación (en estallido, gravativa, etc.) o coexistencia de síntomas asociados, como auras, convulsiones o déficits focales. También se dividen en primarias o secundarias, según la existencia o no de una patología subyacente. Las primarias pueden tener manifestaciones clínicas definidas, pero en las secundarias ciertos signos y síntomas deben alertar sobre la presencia de una patología estructural. En este caso, las neuroimágenes tienen un rol esencial al detectar las causantes del cuadro. Nuestros hallazgos correspondieron a cefaleas primarias (p. ej: infarto migrañoso) y a etiologías orgánicas, entre las que se destacaron causas vasculares, como patología venosa (trombosis), vasoespasmo y leucoencefalopatía posterior reversible; hemorragias intraparenquimatosas y extraaxiales; cefaleas postraumáticas y posquirúrgicas; y causas infecciosas y tumorales (apoplejía hipofisaria e hipertensión endocraneana). Además, hubo malformaciones (Arnold-Chiari, p.ej.) y otras como hipotensión endocraneana. En algunos casos inicialmente se realizó una TC y luego una RM, mientras que en otros la RM fue el método de elección. Las neuroimágenes facilitan el estudio de la cefalea, caracterizando la afección en primaria o secundaria. En el segundo caso permiten, a su vez, clasificar los hallazgos. A review is presented of the radiological findings (computed tomography –CT– and magnetic resonance imaging –MRI–) of headache, according to our experience. According to MESH database this entity is a skull based pain that can have a benign cause or be an expression of a wide spectrum of disorders. Headaches can be classified according to their temporal evolution (acute or chronic), presentation (blow up, aura, rapidly evolutionary, etc.), or according to associated symptoms, such as seizures or focal deficits. They could also be classified into primary or secondary, depending on the presence or absence of demonstrable disease. The primary headaches can have known symptoms (i.e. migraine), but in secondary ones certain symptoms and signs should alert on the existence of structural disease. At this point imaging methods have an outstanding role, as they allow detecting and identifying structural causes in patients with headache. Our findings corresponded to primary headaches (i.e.: migraine infarction) and organic aetiologies, such as vascular causes (venous thrombosis, vasospasm and posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy); intracerebral and extra-axial haemorrhage; post-surgical and post- traumatic headaches; and those due to infections and tumours (pituitary apoplexy or intracranial hypertension). Malformations, such as Arnold-Chiari's, and intracranial hypotension have also been found. In some cases a CT is initially performed and then an MR, whilst in others MR is the method of choice. Neuroimaging facilitates the study of headache, helping to characterise them into primary or secondary. In the latter case, the imaging also enables the findings to be classified.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Stroke is a clinical condition characterized by the sudden onset of focal (or global, in cases of coma) neurological symptoms that persist for over 24 hours or result in death, with no clear cause other than a vascular issue. Case Description: Male, 62 years old, with chief of complaint of mouth dropped to the right since 1 day before admission. Complaints made the patient speak more difficult, slow and unable to form sentences. Physical examination show parese CN. VII UMN dextra. Siriraj score -5 and Head NCCT show cerebral infarction in the internal capsula interna. Patient was diagnosed with ischemic stroke. Discussion: The use of a scoring system can be useful when there are no brain imaging facilities that can clearly distinguish the causative pathology of stroke. criteria for diagnosis of ischemic stroke are symptoms of global neurological deficits or one / several focal neurological deficits that occur suddenly with evidence of brain imaging images (CT scan or MRI). The most common differential diagnosis is hemorrhagic stroke. Conclusion. Early recognition and appropriate treatment is important to cure acute ischemic stroke to achieve good quality of life and prevent further infarct to brain tissue.

      "abstract": "In this review we present a pragmatic approach to the patient with chronic vestibular symptoms. Even in the chronic patient a retrospective diagnosis should be attempted, in order to establish how the patient reached the current situation. Simple questions are likely to establish if the chronic dizzy symptoms started as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease or as a brainstem stroke. Then it is important to establish if the original symptoms are still present, in which case they need to be treated (e.g. repositioning maenouvres for BPPV, migraine prophylaxis) or if you are only dealing with chronic dizzy symptoms. In addition the doctor or physiotherapist needs to establish if the process of central vestibular compensation has been impeded due to additional clinical problems, e.g. visual problems (squints, cataract operation), proprioceptive deficit (neuropathy due to diabetes or alcohol), additional neurological or orthopaedic problems, lack of mobility or confidence, such as fear of falling or psychological disorders. A general neurological examination should also be conducted, amongst other reasons to make sure your patient's `chronic dizziness' is not due to a neurological gait disorder. Treatment of the syndrome of chronic dizziness is multidisciplinary but rehabilitation and simple counselling should be available to all patients. In contrast, vestibular suppressants or tranquilisers should be reduced or, if possible, stopped.",

      "abstract": "Neurologic disorders can affect sleep on multiple levels, depending on the location of the lesion or dysfunction. Many classifications can be used, such as classifications related to the location of the lesion or classifications related to the clinical presentations. The latter have the advantage of enticing the practitioner to systematically evaluate specific sleep disorders. Such classifications include neurodegenerative disorders, neuromuscular disorders, movement disorders, autoimmune disorders, cerebrovascular diseases, seizures, and headaches. The manifestations in terms of their impact on sleep often depend, of course, on the location of the lesion. Some neurologic diseases involve the sleep-wake system. For example, dementing disorders may affect diffuse neural pathways that impact the strength of the circadian rhythm, but also instability of sleep and sleep states. In contrast, other disorders secondarily impact sleep and its quality. As an example, neuromuscular disorders can impact control of swallowing and the airway, which can increase susceptibility to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).",

Das RLS ist eine Erkrankung des zentralen Nervensystems mit sensiblen und motorischen Beschwerden der Beine, die in Ruhe auftreten, sowie ein Bewegungsdrang, der zu ausgeprägten Schlafstörungen führen kann. Es kommt als idiopathisches RLS oder in Assoziation mit vielen internistischen und neurologischen Erkrankungen vor. Die typische Anamnese und ein unauffälliger neurologischer Untersuchungsbefund beim idiopathischen RLS ermöglichen rasch die Diagnosestellung. Zusätzliche laborchemische und/oder elektrophysiologische Untersuchungen sind notwendig, um assoziierte Erkrankungen zu erfassen. Hier spielen insbesondere der Ausschluss einer Polyneuropathie, einer Niereninsuffizienz und einer Eisenstoffwechselstörung eine Rolle. Eine Polysomnographie mit der Registrierung von assoziierten Schlafstörungen und den typischen periodischen Beinbewegungen (PLMS) kann die Diagnose in unklaren Fällen unterstützen. Die Therapie besteht in einer symptomatischen Behandlung mit Dopaminergika als Mittel der ersten Wahl.",

Ces patients souffraient de demence de type Alzheimer, a corps de Lewy, mixte ou non specifiee et presentaient des troubles de comportement moderes a graves. Les chercheurs ont tente d’exclure les patients presentant une depression associee a leur demence. Ainsi, les patients ayant presente un episode depressif majeur dans les six derniers mois ou des symptomes depressifs cliniques lors du recrutement en etaient exclus. Ont egalement ete exclus les patients presentant un diagnostic de schizophrenie, de desordre schizo-affectif, psychotique ou bipolaire, un retard mental, un deficit cognitif secondaire a un traumatisme crânien ou un delirium induit par une substance, l’abus d’alcool ou de drogues, une dependance ou la maladie de Parkinson. D’autre part, une maladie physique instable, une creatinine = 177 umol/l, une enzyme hepatique (AST) ou une bilirubine superieure a deux fois les limites normales, des causes de demence potentiellement reversibles, un traitement avec un neuroleptique depot dans les deux mois precedant le recrutement ou avec de la fluoxetine dans les quatre semaines precedant le recrutement menaient aussi a l’exclusion. Cet echantillon de 103 patients devait suffire a detecter une difference de 15 % entre les deux traitements, avec une puissance de 80 % et un alpha de 0,05. Interventions : L’etude a dure douze semaines. Les patients etaient randomises dans deux groupes et recevaient soit de la risperidone (n = 50), soit du citalopram (n = 53). La dose initiale quotidienne de risperidone etait de 0,5 mg et elle etait titree a 1 mg apres trois jours.

In neurophysiological terms, pain is experienced when selected areas in the limbic system, particularly neurones in the cingulate gyrus and related areas of the somatosensory cortex are excited at the same time . Physiologically, this condition arises when nociceptors in peripheral tissues are stimulated, as is the case following trauma in acute pain or in inflammatory pain (nociceptive pain). However, it is not uncommon that excitation of limbic and related somatosensory cortical neurones originate from abnormal, usually damaged, peripheral or central nervous tissue (neuropathic pain) or as the consequence of psychological mechanisms (psychogenic pain). For the individual it does not matter how the typical state of limbic and somatosensory cortex excitation comes about, because the end result is just as unpleasant.",

Assessment of these impairments is complicated by impairments in the accuracy of self-assessment of functioning on the part of both people with schizophrenia and certain classes of informants. Many of these reports correlate close to zero with performance measured objectively by performance-based tests. Much like the phenomenon of lack of insight, unawareness of functional impairments is predicted by cognitive impairments. In addition, like other neuropsychiatric conditions and healthy individuals, mild depression is associated with increased accuracy of self-assessment. High-contact clinicians may provide reports of functioning that are more convergent with patients' ability as measured by performance-based assessments.

Neurons are highly specialized cells and are responsible for communicating information in both chemical and electrical forms. Unlike other cells, nerve cells normally do not divide and multiply; thus the body does not replace dead or damaged neurons. Neurodegenerative disorders result in progressive degeneration and/or death of nerve cells and can be defined as hereditary and sporadic conditions characterized by progressive nervous system dysfunction. Most of these disorders are associated with degeneration of the affected central or peripheral structures of the nervous system. Neurodegenerative disorders include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease), prion diseases, brain cancer, epilepsy, encephalitis, hydrocephalus, genetic brain disorders, and others. Most of them are incurable and burdensome conditions that cause complications with movement (ataxias), or mental functioning (dementias).",

Gangguan kognitif dibagi menjadi mild cognitive impairment (MCI) dan demensia. Dugaan adanya gangguan kognitif yaitu jika terjadi penurunan fungsi dalam pekerjaan dan aktivitas sehari-hari. Tata laksana di layanan primer dapat dengan identifikasi dan skrining awal, kemudian dilakukan penilaian dan pemeriksaan, serta diagnosis. Setelah itu dapat dilakukan intervensi lingkungan, psikologis ataupun perilaku, keterlibatan sosial, pengaturan nutrisi dan intervensi tidur, serta manajemen gejala neuropsikiatri. Penting untuk menerapkan layanan kesehatan yang berfokus pada skrining demensia dan evaluasi kognitif guna mempersiapkan penyedia layanan kesehatan. Dokter umum dapat merujuk pasien dengan tanda atau gejala awal gangguan kognitif, misalnya memiliki masalah memori atau bahasa.",

Many patients with DLB respond poorly to surgery and anesthesia, and their conditions may worsen if they have other medical complications along with dementia. They may also face high risk of prolonged hospital stay, increased medical problems and/or mortality, causing significant physical, psychosocial, and financial burdens on individuals, family members, and society. Anesthesia, pain medications, old age, and surgery-related stresses are usually held responsible for the complications; however, the exact causes are still not fully understood. Literature on surgery-related complications for patients with DLB appears to be inadequate, and hence the topic merits detailed and systematic research. This article reviews postoperative complications and various surgery-related risk factors for DLB in light of other dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease, as their neuropathologic features overlap with those of DLB.",

Normal aging, depression, and anxiety are commonly associated with memory difficulties, as are many neurologic conditions. Systemic illnesses can impair memory by injuring vulnerable limbic regions sensitive to hypoxia or hypoglycemia. Commonly used over-the-counter and prescription medications can likewise cause amnesia. These conditions disrupt memory in characteristic ways. Recent studies suggest that immediate, recent, and remote memory functions have different neuroanatomic substrates, as do the processes of registration, retention, and retrieval. New classifications have emerged to explain the evidence for multiple memory subsystems. The neuropharmacology of memory now includes several peptides in addition to cholinergic and noradrenergic pathways. Critical limbic regions have been discovered that mediate memory consolidation, and neuronal mechanisms such as long-term potentiation are being implicated in the unique capacity of these areas to permit new learning to take place.",

Early recognition of cognitive decline can allow healthcare providers to reduce the risk of disease progression.

A second reason may be that forms of depression that are not clinically signifi cant, but that are more severe than simple feelings of sadness (i.e., subclinical depression), are not uncommon.

It must be appreciated however, that the aetiology of impotence in diabetes can be due to a variety of factors that cover the whole spectrum of impotence. The problem may be primarily neurogenic, vasculogenic or a combination of these factors. In addition, impotence in the diabetic may be contributed to or caused by diuretic or antihypertensive medication, a penile abnormality such as Peyronie's disease or be purely psychogenic. Whatever the possible organic basis for the problem, an additional psychogenic overlay is likely. It is apparent therefore that a comprehensive medical history and specific detailed psychosexual history are required, together with a relevant clinical examination and screening before a likely cause or causes can be identified and appropriate treatment instituted. This cannot readily be undertaken in a busy outpatient department and time must be made available for the impotent patient to be comprehensively counselled in a specially designated clinic.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain, which is widespread worldwide, has negative physical and psychological effects and can cause serious decreases in quality of life. There are various types of chronic pain such as musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, head-facial pain and it is caused by different factors. However, it is one of the issues that should be taken into consideration that chronic pain that manifests itself on the body is not only caused by biological reasons, but may also have a psychological background. In this context, there is a lot of evidence that psychological trauma plays an important role in the onset of chronic pain by increasing pain sensitivity and severity. In the light of this information, how different types of trauma such as ‘psychological trauma’, ‘post-traumatic stress disorder’, ‘childhood traumas’ affect chronic pain has been mentioned in detail. In addition, emotional factors also play a role in chronic pain, and even pain and emotions share a common neurobiology. Research findings on how the relationship between different types of emotions and chronic pain has been revealed. In the literature, there are many studies on the connection of emotions and psychological trauma history with the body. However, especially in Turkey, studies examining these variables in chronic pain are insufficient and it is thought that more research is needed. Accordingly, the aim of this article is to review the existing theories and research on the relationship between chronic pain, trauma and emotions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Five new cases and 30 others from the literature were characterized by the clinical triad of progressive external ophthalmoplegia, atypical pigmentary degeneration of the retina, and heart block. The syndrome is sporadic, not hereditary, and begins by the age of 20 years. In many cases there is other evidence of widespread neurological disorder, implicating specific areas: cerebellum; auditory and vestibular systems; skeletal muscle; and, less often, intellectual function or corticospinal tracts. Short stature and delayed sexual maturation are also frequent. The CSF protein content is almost always greater than 100 mg/dl. Spongioform encephalopathy was found in 4 postmortem examinations. In all cases so examined, muscle mitochondria were abnormal. The constancy of these manifestations suggests that the disorder is a true entity, not an artificial subclass of the large group of disorders associated with ophthalmoplegia. Several characteristics suggest that the disorder of neuronal and muscle metabolism is induced by persistent viral infection. The sequence of manifestations may vary, and cardiopathy in particular may be delayed for many years. Patients with ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary degeneration of the retina, and abnormal CSF protein content are likely to develp the full syndrome. This was illustrated by observation of 2 previously reported cases and 1 new one. Because the cardiopathy may be fatal, a pacemaker should be used if indications are appropriate.",

      "title": "Fibromyalgia or pseudo fibromyalgia? - We have to get it right",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain disorders like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, repetitive strain injury and myofascial pain syndromes are no more considered as ‘waste basket diagnosis’, especially because of better biological understanding of these disorders including their immunological and genetic links.1-3 Patients truly suffering from these illnesses, therefore, need to be recognised correctly. Missing these peculiar illnesses and thereby messing them up by misdiagnosing as more serious ailments like Rheumatoid arthritis, other arthritic conditions, connective tissue diseases, psychiatric illnesses or malingering are expensive errors. An equally expensive error is labelling these close mimics and other pseudo fibromyalgia states as fibromyalgia. In both the scenarios, implications can be clinical (progression of an undiagnosed illness), pharmacological (toxicity of an unwarranted drug therapy) economic, emotional, social or even legal. Unfortunately, these errors are made by General practitioners, Physicians, orthopedicians, Psychiatrists and by Rheumatologists alike.4 Syndromic approach to diagnosis of illnesses relies upon physical signs and investigations to a large extent. In pain disorders like fibromyalgia, however, the vague, ‘out of proportion’ tenderness on minor pressure or even a gentle touch may be the only other notable feature apart from the widespread aches complained by the patient. There is no ‘tell-tale’ sign elicitable by inspection, palpation, percussion or auscultation for this spectrum of illnesses. Laboratory investigations always draw a blank. Chronic pain disorders, therefore, cannot be diagnosed by this conventional approach.5 Although chronic wide spread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and mental fogging are some of the hallmarks of these illnesses, familiarity with classification criteria is a prerequisite to identify a good number of them. There are patients, however, with these illnesses that do not fulfill any criteria. Neurochemical misbalances, rather than anatomical lesions are more likely to cause these disorders; nor are they straightforward psychiatric illnesses, in spite of many reports of mind-body link in these conditions.6, 7 While rheumatology clinics in the western and developed world are flooded with such patients and rheumatologists in those parts of the world are more familiar with these illnesses, developing world is less familiar with these maladies. Now that the epidemic seems to be reaching the less developed world, many unanswered questions need to be addressed on this subject. Is it globalization that is bringing it to the developing world, where people earlier could tolerate small aches and pains better? Is it much less common amongst the underprivileged section of the society? Do lifestyle, dietary factors and other socioeconomic factors have some influence on pain threshold, if not on causation of these new world diseases? Painful disorders with anatomical lesions like inflammatory arthropathies, connective tissue diseases and osteoarthritis may also cause vicious cycle of ‘pain begetting more pain’, which may be termed as secondary fibromyalgia.8 On the contrary and paradoxically enough, there is a paradigm shift in the understanding of pain disorders; it is now believed widely that pain itself can cause localised inflammation in a significant proportion of cases and thereby induces this novel mechanism to perpetuate the vicious cycle of pain.9 Whether this has a therapeutic implication is arguable, but breaking this cycle is important in arresting the pain process. Mimics of fibromyalgia comprise a wide spectrum. On the one end, there are highly treatable low grade metabolic disorders like hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency causing chronic widespread pain. These relatively common disorders need to be excluded or diagnosed and treated, as the case may be, in a chronic pain scenario.10 On the other end of this spectrum, there are more serious organic pathologies like enthesopathic pain of spondyloarthropathies and at times, out of proportion pain and tenderness of leukemic arthropathies, especially in children presenting as vague aches and pains. Attending physician need to be sensitized to avoid misdiagnosing these conditions as fibromyalgia. Last, but not the least, undiagnosed cases of psychiatric illnesses including depression and malin-gering for social, emotional or economic gains can also present as ‘pseudofibromyalgia’.11, 12 The Chinese study in this issue by Rong MU et al. has revealed poor awareness and deficiency in diagnostic skills amongst doctors including rheumatologists and is a must- read article for all. Some of the points discussed in the preceding paragraphs are realised in this paper. Many rheumatologists who considered themselves non-believers of this vague entity in the recent past, have now turned into believers in view of emerging evidences cited above. No rheumatologist can afford to make a mistake today in diagnosing or excluding these modern day illnesses.",

      "abstract": "Kernaussagen Definition und Diagnostik Die Diagnose Anpassungsstörung gehört zu den im DSM-IV und im ICD-10 eher weniger gut operationalisierten Kategorien. Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

Segun el area danada, se alteraran diferentes funciones visuales, como el campo visual, percepcion del movimiento, control de la escena visual compleja, control de los movimientos corporales guiados por la vision, la atencion visual, el comportamiento influenciado por un entorno complejo y el reconocimiento de una imagen. La etiologia de la disfuncion es variada, pero esta intimamente ligado con la prematuridad. Los principales mecanismos que pueden provocar la disfuncion visual cerebral son el sindrome hemorragico-isquemico, lesiones neurologicas focales, traumatismos, hidrocefalia, infecciones, hipoglucemias neonatales, metabolopatias, malformaciones cerebrales, cromosomopatias y epilepsia. El diagnostico de esta entidad es dificil, y en muchos casos, de exclusion. Ademas de evaluar la agudeza visual, la campimetria, la sensibilidad al contraste, la motilidad ocular, la estereopsis y la morfologia del polo anterior y posterior del ojo, contamos con unos cuestionarios especialmente disenados para identificar la disfuncion visual cerebral. En nuestro estudio hemos estudiado una poblacion de nacidos pretermino a la edad de 5 anos y, tras una exploracion oftalmologica completa, hemos realizado el cuestionario a los cuidadores de los pacientes a fin de identificar una posible disfuncion visual cerebral y, a la vez, poder aconsejar ciertas medidas rehabilitadores a fin de mejorar la calidad de vida de estos pacientes.",

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, followed by vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and (especially at younger ages) frontotemporal dementia. Other possible causes of the dementia syndrome with relevance to a debate on the use of neuroimaging include space-occupying lesions, normal pressure hydrocephalus and other rarer neurological diseases which can be associated with variable cognitive impairments, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multi-system atrophy and corticobasal degeneration. There is a great and, with the aging of the population, ever growing demand for the investigation of patients with suspected dementia, as exemplified by the rapid expansion of services such as memory clinics. It is essential that everyone presenting with signs suggestive of cognitive failure is given the opportunity to undergo a full assessment to help determine the subtype of dementia, which will include appropriate investigations. However, it is equally essential that investigations are appropriately targeted, according to their evidence base, and only performed when they have the potential to have a significant bearing on diagnosis or management.",

      "title": "Neuropathic pain and diabetes",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a common phenomenon resulting from injury to the central or peripheral nervous system. The means by which diabetes results in nerve injury is unclear but the effect is to cause injury at all levels of the nervous system from the level of the peripheral nerves to the brain. Nerve injury causes pain through a cascade of mechanisms resulting in altered processing of sensory input into the nervous system. This alteration occurs through chemical and anatomical changes in the nervous system that are similar to some of the processes seen in central sensitisation following acute pain. Following nerve injury, neuropathic pain occurs not only when these mechanisms are activated but also when sensitisation is maintained. Other processes occurring in neuropathic pain appear to be a loss of normal inhibitory controls as seen by a reduction in local GABA-ergic and descending monoaminergic influences. There are also important changes mediated via glial cells that can maintain neuropathic pain. Diabetes affects all areas of the nervous system and the contribution of higher levels of the nervous system is often overlooked. Neurophysiological and MRI evidence strongly suggest that these may contribute to the pain of diabetic neuropathy. Psychological dysfunction in diabetic patients is an important factor in increasing the suffering associated with all aspects of the disease, but treatment and control of pain can greatly improve the quality of life.

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

If we avoid Cartesian dualism, the claim that mental disorders are biological is obviously a tautology. Given the facts above, psychiatric diagnostic manuals, such as the DSM and ICD, are school examples of what evidence-based science is not and represent nothing but a failed attempt to build a legal road from Health Care to Hell Care by over-medicalization and by the suffering of human and non-human animals. Furthermore, psychiatric drugs can have long-lasting effects on the brain and the central nervous system, while the withdrawal from them can cause a range of severe physical and psychological effects.",

      "title": "Psychische Befunde bei Migräne und Kopfschmerz vom Spannungstyp – eine Übersicht",
      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Nach den Erkenntnissen der modernen neurophysiologischen Grundlagenforschung und neuroradiologischer Studien wird die Migräne (MI) als ein neurobiologisches resp. neurovaskuläres Syndrom definiert. Diese Sicht schließt eine ätiologisch-pathogenetische Beteiligung psychischer Befunde nicht prinzipiell aus, diesbezügliche Forsschungsaktivitäten sind umfangreich. Entsprechendes gilt für den Kopfschmerz vom Spannungstyp (SK). Die These von einer spezifischen MI-Persönlichkeit bzw. einem spezifischen Typus migraenicus hat sich nicht erhärten lassen. Wohl aber gibt es zahlreiche Beobachtungen einschließlich psychometrischer Testmethoden, die eine Komorbidität der MI und des SK mit Neurotizismus, depressiven Störungen und Angststörungen belegen. Manche Autoren postulieren eine kausale Beziehung. Diesbezügliche Thesen müssen aber relativiert werden. Neurotizismus, Depressivität, Angststörungen, ihrerseits eng miteinander verknüpft, lassen sich nur bei einem Teil der MI-Patienten nachweisen, abhängig vom Alter, von Dauer und Schwere der MI und wohl auch von der Region (Großstadt/Land), in der die Studien erstellt wurden. Es besteht keine Spezifität bezüglich MI und SK. Gleiche Befunde gibt es bei chronischen Schmerzsyndromen anderer Lokalisation (ohne Kopfschmerz). Depressive Störungen sind bei einer ganzen Reihe chronischer neurologischer Erkrankungen in beträchtlicher Größenordnung wie bei MI bekannt, und primäre depressive Störungen ihrerseits gehen häufig mit leiblichen Schmerzempfindungen, insbesondere auch mit Kopfschmerz, einher. Derzeit gibt es keine schlüssigen Hinweise auf eine ätiologisch-pathogenetische Verknüpfung der MI mit den genannten psychischen Merkmalen bzw. Störungen. Gleiches gilt für den SK, der ohnehin keine Entität darstellt, nur dass hier beim chronischen SK die Tendenz zu Neurotizismus und depressiven Störungen ausgeprägter zu sein scheint als bei der MI und dem episodischen SK.",

      "abstract": "Background: Dyspnea is a common symptom affecting as many as 25% of patients seen in the ambulatory setting.It can arise from many different underlying conditions and is sometimes a manifestation of a life-threatening disease.Methods: This review is based on pertinent articles retrieved by a selective search in PubMed, and on pertinent guidelines.Results: The term dyspnea refers to a wide variety of subjective perceptions, some of which can be influenced by the patient's emotional state.A distinction is drawn between dyspnea of acute onset and chronic dyspnea: the latter, by definition, has been present for more than four weeks.The history, physical examination, and observation of the patient's breathing pattern often lead to the correct diagnosis, yet, in 30-50% of cases, more diagnostic studies are needed, including biomarker measurements and other ancillary tests.The diagnosis can be more difficult to establish when more than one underlying disease is present simultaneously.The causes of dyspnea include cardiac and pulmonary disease (congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome; pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and many other conditions (anemia, mental disorders). Conclusion:The many causes of dyspnea make it a diagnostic challenge.Its rapid evaluation and diagnosis are crucial for reducing mortality and the burden of disease.",

      "title": "Interventionism and Intelligibility: Why Depression Is Not (Always) a Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious condition with a large disease burden. It is often claimed that MDD is a “brain disease.” What would it mean for MDD to be a brain disease? I argue that the best interpretation of this claim is as offering a substantive empirical hypothesis about the causes of the syndrome of depression. This syndrome-causal conception of disease, combined with the idea that MDD is a disease of the brain, commits the brain disease conception of MDD to the claim that brain dysfunction causes the symptoms of MDD. I argue that this consequence of the brain disease conception of MDD is false. It incorrectly rules out genuine instances of content-sensitive causation between adverse conditions in the world and the characteristic symptoms of MDD. Empirical evidence shows that the major causes of depression are genuinely psychological causes of the symptoms of MDD. This rules out, in many cases, the “brute” causation required by the brain disease conception. The existence of cases of MDD with non-brute causes supports the reinstatement of the old nosological distinction between endogenous and exogenous depression.",

Se trata de una enfermedad neurodegenerativa que provoca dificultad a la hora de recordar sucesos recientes. No tiene cura aparente, solo la existencia de fármacos y terapias como la estimulación cognitiva, la musicoterapia, la terapia ocupacional o las actividades con animales que mejoran o reducen la enfermedad. Material y métodos; se ha realizado una revisión bibliográfica de estas terapias cotejando diversos artículos encontrados en varias bases de datos para demostrar la eficacia de éstas en comparación con los métodos tradicionales. Resultados; tras el análisis de los estudios hallados, se ha visto que la estimulación cognitiva junto con la musicoterapia, son las más estudiadas; encontrando varios estudios en los cuales dichos pacientes mejoran la orientación y la memoria. Pero que no solo ellas, sino que, todas las demás terapias halladas, provocan una ralentización de la enfermedad incrementando el estado cognitivo, la memoria, la capacidad funcional o incluso el estado de ánimo, ya que estos pacientes se encuentran decaídos. Conclusión; todas estas terapias unidas al tratamiento farmacológico proporcionan a los enfermos una mejor calidad de vida reduciendo no sólo la demencia sino los síntomas que el Alzheimer conlleva.",

Besonders häufig treten Angsterkrankungen, Suchterkrankungen, Persönlichkeitsstörungen und Aufmerksamkeitsdefizithyperaktivitätssyndrome zusätzlich auf. Komorbide Störungen komplizieren den Verlauf der bipolaren Störung: Im Schnitt haben Patienten mit bipolar affektiver Störung plus Komorbidität eine schlechteres Funktionsniveau, sie haben ein früheres Ersterkrankungsalter und sprechen schlechter auf die Therapie an. Es gibt wenig gesicherte Erkenntnis zur Therapie “komorbider” Störungen plus bipolar affektiver Störungen. Auch ist die nosologische Einordnung der zusätzlichen Erkrankungen nicht unumstritten: Manche genetischen und Verlaufsuntersuchungen weisen darauf hin, dass hinter dem gleichzeitigen Auftreten mehrerer psychischer Störungen eigenständige Krankheitsprozesse (im Sinne breiter Spektra oder “Formenkreise”) stehen könnten.",

      "abstract": "Celem pracy jest zwrócenie uwagi na znaczenie objawów poznawczych i neuropsychiatrycznych w chorobie Parkinsona (PD, Parkinson’s disease ). Należą one do grupy objawów pozaruchowych. Uwzględnienie ich w całościowym, interdyscyplinarnym procesie diagnostyczno-terapeutycznym zwiększa szanse na optymalne fizyczne, psychiczne, poznawcze oraz społeczne funkcjonowanie chorych i zachowanie przez nich ogólnej dobrej jakości życia. Choć zburzenia neuropsychiatryczne i funkcji poznawczych mogą być bardziej uciążliwe dla chorych niż zaburzenia ruchowe, to często są one pomijane w procesie diagnostycznym i leczeniu. Ich współwystępowanie obniża efektywność leczenia podstawowego, przyspieszając proces deterioracji fizycznej i poznawczej, i prowadząc do większej niepełnosprawności i śmier telności. Profil objawów neuropsychologicznych w PD jest specyficzny, odmienny niż w innych chorobach neurozwyrodnieniowych (np. chorobie Alzheimera), i obejmuje zaburzenia w zakresie pięciu podstawowych obszarów poznawczych, tj.: funkcji wykonawczych z bradyfrenią, pamięci, sprawności wzrokowo-przestrzennej, procesów uwagi, sprawności językowej. W momencie rozpoznania łagodne zaburzenia poznawcze występują u 30% chorych, po 3 latach — u 50%, natomiast po kilkunastu latach u 80–90% pacjentów z PD rozpoznaje się otępienie. W populacji ogólnej osób w wieku powyżej 65 lat rozpowszechnienie otępienia w przebiegu PD wynosi 2–4%. Wzrastająca długość życia chorych oraz potr zeba podnoszenia jakości życia pacjentów z chorobami neurozwyro dnieniowymi skłaniają do poszukiwania bardziej efektywnych metod wczesnej diagnostyki i wielostronnego leczenia, z uwzględnieniem oddziaływań farmakologicznych i niefarmakologicznych.",

Motor or phonic tics that persist for more than 1 year are defined as persistent (chronic) tic disorder. Tourette syndrome can be diagnosed if a child has multiple motor tics and at least one phonic tic for more than 1 year with onset before age 18 years. Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Transient and developmental movement disorders include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, jitteriness in neonates, shuddering, and stereotypies.",

      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "title": "Cognition et qualité de vie dans la sclérose en plaques",
      "abstract": "La sclerose en plaques (SEP) est une maladie neurodegenerative qui peut avoir des repercussions sensorimotrices evidentes. Il est aussi maintenant bien documente que le profil cognitif peut egalement etre altere par cette pathologie. Differentes fonctions cognitives peuvent etre touchees de maniere heterogene, notamment la vitesse de traitement de l'information, la memoire, l'attention et le fonctionnement executif. L'evaluation neuropsychologique exhaustive sert a bien documenter l'atteinte cognitive presente. Or, puisque ce genre d'evaluation peut necessiter plusieurs heures, il est courant d'employer dans les cliniques de SEP des questionnaires de depistage se basant sur une appreciation subjective de la presence ou non de troubles cognitifs. Toutefois, certaines etudes suggerent que l'evaluation subjective des troubles cognitifs, ne constitue pas le reflet juste de l'atteinte cognitive. En effet, certains auteurs rapportent que les patients sous-estiment leurs capacites cognitives alors que d'autres suggerent plutot une surestimation de ces memes capacites. Compte tenu des differentes atteintes que peut engendrer la SEP, il est aussi peu surprenant que la qualite de vie (QV) en soit affectee. En effet, on retrouve bon nombre d'etudes qui documentent l'impact de la maladie sur la QV. Differents facteurs permettent d'expliquer cette diminution de la QV, notamment les symptomes sensorimoteurs et depressifs, mais aussi le statut cognitif. Bien que plusieurs auteurs se soient interesses a l'evaluation subjective de la cognition et de la QV, l'impact de la severite de l'atteinte cognitive sur ces deux variables reste tres peu documente, voire aucunement. Cette these vise donc a documenter l'impact de la severite de l'atteinte cognitive, d'une part sur l'estimation subjective des troubles de memoire et d'autre part sur l'estimation de la QV. Pour la premiere etude, 30 patients avec SEP ont ete compares a 24 temoins sans atteinte neurologique sur une mesure subjective de plaintes mnesiques (Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire, PRMQ) et differentes tâches psychometriques, dont le Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Les tâches psychometriques ont aussi servi a departager les patients selon la severite de leur atteinte cognitive (legere et moderee/severe). Les resultats montrent que les patients avec une atteinte moderee/severe obtiennent des resultats significativement inferieurs a ceux des deux autres groupes sur la tâche mnesique objective (RAVLT), alors qu'ils obtiennent des scores similaires aux temoins au questionnaire subjectif (PRMQ). En revanche, le groupe de patients avec une atteinte cognitive legere ne se distingue pas significativement des controles sur la tâche RAVLT, mais rapportent pourtant plus de plaintes au PRMQ. Cette etude explique donc la disparite des resultats dans la litterature scientifique quant a l'evaluation subjective des competences cognitives. En effet, les patients avec une atteinte cognitive legere tendent a sous-estimer leurs capacites mnesiques alors que les patients avec une atteinte moderee/severe surestiment ces memes habiletes. Pour la seconde etude, 56 patients avec SEP ont ete compares a 189 controles sans atteinte neurologique sur un questionnaire de QV (Inventaire Systemique de Qualite de Vie, ISQV). Une batterie de tests psychometriques a aussi servi a departager le groupe SEP selon leur degre d'atteinte cognitive (legere et moderee/severe). Les resultats montrent une difference entre les groupes SEP et temoins sur differentes spheres de QV dont la QV globale, l'entretien menager, le travail et la cognition. Une fois de plus, les resultats doivent etre modules en fonction de la severite de l'atteinte cognitive : les patients avec SEP avec une atteinte moderee/severe se distinguent des controles pour les indices QV globale, entretien menager et travail, mais pas pour l'indice cognition. En revanche, les patients avec une atteinte legere se distinguent des controles uniquement pour l'indice cognition. Ces resultats mettent donc en evidence la contribution de la severite de l'atteinte cognitive quant a l'estimation de la QV chez les patients avec SEP. L'impact sur la QV est present pour les deux groupes, mais n'affecte pas les memes spheres chez les patients avec une atteinte moderee/severe que chez les patients avec une atteinte legere. Ces deux etudes soulignent donc l'impact determinant de la severite de l'atteinte cognitive tant sur l'evaluation subjective des habiletes cognitives (ici plus particulierement la memoire) que sur la satisfaction de la QV. Globalement, on retient que l'estimation subjective ne represente pas le reflet reel des competences et que l'estimation de la QV est differente pour les deux groupes comparativement aux temoins.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : sclerose en plaques, cognition, qualite de vie, evaluation subjective",

      "abstract": "Pathology at the molecular and cellular level is the fundamental basis of disorders that effect the brain or spinal cord of humans. A pathophysiological event can target specific molecules and groups of cells, causing neuronal dysfunction and degeneration and resulting in acute and chronic neurological and behavioral disabilities ranging from memory loss to paralysis. For example, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with loss of forebrain neurons and the formation of brain lesions consisting of abnormal deposits of glial- or -neuronal generated amyloid β protein, possibly in response to gene mutations, synaptic perturbations, oxidative stress, or neuronal cytoskeletal defects (1–5). The degeneration of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with impairments in glutamate reuptake by astroglia (6,7), gene mutations in superoxide dismutase- 1 (8), and abnormal apoptosis of motor neurons that appears to be mediated by programmed cell death mechanisms (9,10). The nerve cell damage in adults and children that have experienced cardiac arrest, asphyxiation, strokes, and head or spinal cord trauma may be caused by failure of astroglial glutamate transport, excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors, abnormal activation or impaired function of intracellular signaling pathways, toxic generation of free oxygen radicals, and structural damage to target molecules within selectively vulnerable populations of neurons (11). Epidemiological studies reveal the impact that neurodegenerative disorders have on our society. For example, AD affects ~4 million adults (most are>65-yr-of-age) and is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for>100,000 deaths annually (12). ALS affects approx 30,000 Americans (4–6 people in 100,000) (13). Stroke is the third leading cause of death in industrialized populations and is a major cause of long term neurological disability (14).",

Personality traits are pervasive ways of thinking, feeling and behaving present from young adulthood and unexplained by social and cultural factors. Functional Neurological Symptoms (FNS) manifest as neurological symptoms such as tremor, weakness, seizures and cognitive or sensory disturbance, but the clinical examination points away from an organic cause and investigations fail to find one. FNS are involuntary and unwanted and are clinically significant because of associated disability. Functional seizures are one of the most common functional neurological presentations.

However, symptoms do not have a medical explanation but these are very real and not feigning the symptoms. It produces severe detrimental effects on patients’ daily functioning and social and occupational life like other mental illnesses. Severe distress and traumatic life circumstances are identified as the main causes of this illness, which are converted into symptoms in individuals. Patients showed ignorance of his symptoms even though these were severe and distressful which was called La-belle indifference. However, it was not shown by many patients, so it was removed from the diagnostic criteria of this illness. Dissociative conversion disorder is associated with many other mental health conditions like anxiety disorder and depression. Cognitive behavior therapy and psychoanalysis therapy are helpful in the treatment of this disorder.",

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

      "abstract": "Il est classique de dire que le deuil va entraîner des conséquences biopsychosociales. Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil. La prise en charge doit mettre le deuil au centre de la réflexion : – en traitant l’individu, en appréciant : ∘ la spécificité de son deuil : pré-deuil, deuil « blanc », deuil « non élaboré », deuil de l’enfant, de l’adolescent, de l’adulte, de la personne âgée voire très âgée, les circonstances de la mort du proche : mort d’un enfant, mort par suicide, par homicide, par accident survenant pendant un transport (voiture, train, bateau, etc.) après une catastrophe naturelle, si la mort est brutale et que la personne y a assisté ou si elle a failli elle-même mourir ; – en traitant le groupe : ∘ familial avec une approche transgénérationnelle, ∘ d’individus bénéficiant d’une prise en charge groupale : avec un même type d’endeuillés ou avec des endeuillés de causes différentes.",

      "title": "Role of Social Support as a Mediator in Negative Stressful Life Event and Somatic Complaints of Managerial Personnel",
      "abstract": "In this Complex life scenario employees have to face different challenging task that either related to work or to day to day life situation, both of these causes some sort of problem to employees. Sometimes they express these problems in term of their bodily discomfort or simply somatic complaints. Somatic complaints are increasing day by day in this complex life scenario. Some of them are caused due to physical disturbances in the body while some of them are due to psychological stress that employees get from their life events. Somatic complaints like headache, abdominal pain, backache, insomnia, dizziness, and fatigue are common among employees (Aro, Paroncn, & Aro, 1987; Goodman & McGrath, 1991). Such complaints are inversely related to well-being (Millstein, 1993).Somatic complaints are reported either as in descriptive or subjective reports. Somatic complaints are a descriptive term that does not reflect any preassumptions about etiology. Somatic symptoms are subjective reports of physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or muscle pain. The expression of somatic complaints as a manifestation of social or psychological distress is recognized cross culturally (Escobar & Gureje, 2007; Murphy, 1989) but in low- and middle income countries (LAMICs) its evaluation is complicated by the high burden of undiagnosed disease and under nutrition, as well as by limited access to health services.It is also viewed that psychosomatic complaints are important indicators of psychosocial health (Piko, 2007) and well-being (Bemtsson, Kohler, & Gustafsson, 2001). By definition, they are subjective physical complaints (headache, stomachache, back ache, and dizziness) as well as psychological complaints (feeling low, irritability, nervousness, and difficulty in getting to sleep that are not caused by an underlying physical disease (Natvig, Albrektsen, Anderssen, & Qvamtstrom, 1999, p. 362).There are multiple socioemotional factors associated with reports of somatic symptoms (Garralda, 2010), including stress and reduced coping abilities (Walker et al., 2007). Children with chronic disease may have poor coping skills that may be related to somatic symptoms (Stewart et al., 2010).Findings indicate that somatic symptoms are associated with high levels of co-morbid psychological symptoms, like anxiety and depression (Haug, Mykletun, & Dahl, 2004), as well as high levels of functional impairment (Mulvaney, Lambert, Garber, & Walker, 2006; Aromaa, Sillanpaa, Rautava, & Helenius, 2000). Different theoretical approaches have dominated the research in understanding somatic symptomatology. Empirical support has been found for the idea that life events perceived as negative or stressful for individuals have the potential to produce somatic symptoms (Murberg, 2012).A stressful or traumatic life situation is one that generates challenges on which the organisms cannot completely respond. Life stress refers to the psychological response state of disturbed affect in relation to stressors in one's life as whole (Parasuram, Greenhouse, & Granrose, 1992). Life stress can result from specific major events or the cumulative effect of daily hassles (Rowdena, Matthewsb, Watsona, & Biggs, 2011). The life events tradition focuses on the global impact of life changes. It covers a wide range of events that either be positive or negative in nature. Research has shown that stressors are detrimental not only to indicators of psychological well-being, such as mood, but also to somatic complaints (Spector & Jex, 1998). Among others, the stress response is characterized by the activation of the sympatheticadrenal medullar system, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and catecholamine secretion. Over time, such reactions can result in the experience of somatic com-plaints, such as headache, back pain, and gastrointestinal problems.Social support is a significant feature of an individual's social environment and varying levels of support will be perceived as available to the individual in times of need (Snow, Swan, Raghavan, Connell, & Klein, 2003). …",

      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

The studies reporting the highest incidence of intellectual impairment (69.9%) used psychologic assessment techniques, whereas studies identifying the lowest prevalence of dementia (30.2%) depended on nonstandardized clinical examinations. Neuro-psychologic investigations reveal that PD patients manifest impairment in memory, visuospatial skills, and set aptitude. Language function is largely spared. Intellectual deterioration in PD correlates with age, akinesia, duration, and treatment status. Neuropathologic and neurochemical observations demonstrate that PD is a heterogeneous disorder: the classic subcortical pathology with dopamine deficiency may be complicated by atrophy of nucleus basalis and superimposed cortical cholinergic deficits, and a few patients have the histopathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Mild intellectual loss occurs with the classic pathology, and the more severe dementia syndromes have cholinergic alterations or Alzheimer's disease. Thus, PD includes several syndromes of intellectual impairment with variable pathologic and neurochemical correlates. ( J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol 1988;1:24-36).",

However, the neurologic exam can also be challenging and limited due to limited patient participation. Although it may not be apparent at first, even the coma exam provides localization. Pace and localization may appear different due to circumstances of the patient, but they can still be incredibly helpful at arriving at the diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "This scientific commentary refers to ‘ECHS1 mutations in Leigh disease: a new inborn error of metabolism affecting valine metabolism’ by Peters et al. (doi:10.1093/awu216). \n\nMitochondrial disorders are the most common inherited metabolic abnormalities of energy production. Patients can present with a wide variety of clinical phenotypes depending on the tissue affected. In general, tissues with the highest energy demands, such as brain, muscle, heart and liver, are the most severely affected. Several neurological syndromes are caused by defective mitochondrial energy production, of which Leigh syndrome is one of the best known. Leigh syndrome is an often fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, first described in 1951 by the British psychiatrist and neuropathologist Denis Leigh (1951). Typically, patients with Leigh syndrome present with focal, bilateral lesions commonly found in the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, brainstem or spinal cord. Clinical symptoms depend on the affected area of the CNS and include among others hypotonia, psychomotor delay, dystonia, seizures, ataxia, dysphagia and failure to thrive.\n\nThe first cases of Leigh syndrome were suggested to result from a deficiency of thiamine metabolism on the basis of their similarity with Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Remarkably, a direct link between Leigh syndrome and defective thiamine metabolism was only proven 60 years later by the identification of pathogenic mutations in hTHTR2 (now known as SLC19A3), a thiamine transporter, in patients with Leigh syndrome (Gerards et al., 2013). To date, mutations in over 35 genes have been associated with the disorder and this number is increasing annually. In this issue of Brain , Peters and colleagues add to the total by identifying pathogenic mutations …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Rationale, aims and objective We questioned: what kind of relationships between mental and neurobiological levels of complexity is or could become useful in the psychiatric practice? The concept of mind and associated mood states defended here is that they are physically emergent, subjective, qualitative, unified features of the brain. We compared our neurobiological assessment also to psychoanalytical practice (first person's perspective). Argument Applied to recent work on major depressive disorder ( MDD ), our ideas are among other supported by clinical and experimental studies on sleep deprivation, deep brain stimulation and epidemiological assessments of time‐to‐recovery. Clinical implications We suggest that depression is a transient state of the brain, that is mutually exclusive to the state of pleasure (in the F reudian context), rather than a disorder or disease with a characteristic time course (like many reversible somatic diseases). MDD can best be described with stochastic transition models, which is discussed in the context of a presumed brain serotonin dysfunction in depression. Our ideas invite a reconsideration of some concepts underlying current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Medically unexplained visual loss, or functional visual loss, or nonorganic visual loss (NOVL) denotes diminished visual acuity or field without discernible ocular or neurological pathology. Variously termed in the literature, it eludes organic diagnosis following a thorough examination. Symptoms range from mild blurriness to total blindness, sometimes presenting as tunnel vision or hemianopias. Diagnosis entails comprehensive eye evaluation to exclude organic causes like refractive error or cataracts. NOVL frequently correlates with psychological conditions like depression or anxiety, implicating psychological influence in its etiology. Thus, NOVL underscores the complex interplay between physical and psychological factors in visual impairment, necessitating holistic diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This chapter elucidates the diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms pertaining to functional visual disorder (FVD) or nonorganic vision loss (NOVL), prevalent presentations posing diagnostic challenges across diverse medical disciplines. It delineates the historical evolution of terminology denoting patients manifesting vision loss incongruous with established neurological or ophthalmic pathologies, necessitating a collaborative, interprofessional approach. Diagnostic modalities, ranging from meticulous ocular assessments to comprehensive psychological evaluations, reflect the intricate etiological spectrum underlying NOVL. This exposition serves as a pivotal reference for healthcare professionals navigating the diagnostic intricacies and therapeutic imperatives intrinsic to NOVL, advocating for a holistic, patient-centric approach underscored by scientific rigor, and compassionate care.",

      "abstract": "Extreme states can be psychospiritual and “functional” in origin or they can be “organic” and driven by biological dysfunction. Contemporary psychiatry largely rejects this distinction, preferring to insist that everything “extreme” is biological in origin; but the distinction is important for understanding and helping people. Psychospiritual crises, including those labeled bipolar or schizophrenic, are “functional” and express meaning. As “bizarre” as the language or the symbols may seem, meanings that often reflect childhood abuse can be explored in a trusting, kind, and caring therapeutic relationship. The more that a real biological or organic dysfunction, such as traumatic head injury or neurotoxic exposure, is the root cause of the extreme state, the less sense its manifestations will make. Nonetheless, drug-induced extreme states, even when caused by hallucinogens or by psychiatric “medicines,” often leave sufficient brain function operational to reveal important meanings about the person’s experience, along with the otherwise senseless intoxication. With so many people prescribed psychiatric drugs, these neurotoxic chemicals are now the most common cause of extreme states in clinical practice, and withdrawal from these offending agents is critical to recovery (Breggin, 2013). However, even when the extreme state is driven by neurological dysfunction, a safe space and skilled therapists can help relieve the individual’s otherwise overwhelming feelings of anxiety or terror.",

This narrative review focuses on the main clinical presentations of cognitive and psychological problems ('mind injuries') that occur postoperatively in absence of ascertainable focal neurologic deficits, exploring their pathophysiological mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention and treatment. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a potentially devastating complication that can involve several mechanisms and several predisposing, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors, which can result in or be associated to cerebral microvascular damage. Postoperative depression is influenced by genetic or psychosocial predisposing factors, by neuroendocrine activation, and by the release of several pro-inflammatory factors. The net effect of these changes is neuroinflammation. These complex biochemical alterations, along with an aspecific response to stressful life events, might target the function of several brain areas, which are thought to represent a trigger factor for the onset of depression.",

Diagnosing Meige syndrome is challenging due to its similarities with various movement disorders and psychiatric conditions. Functional neurological disorder (FND) refers to a condition characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with recognized neurological or medical conditions. Symptoms may include motor or sensory disturbances such as weakness, tremors, paralysis, or seizures. Importantly, these symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition or by the direct effects of a substance. Instead, they are believed to stem from psychological factors. This case demonstrates the diagnostic dilemma of Meige syndrome. It was initially misdiagnosed as a functional neurological disorder in a 42-year-old female. The difficulties in differentiating between these disorders highlight the necessity of a thorough evaluation and increased clinical suspicion in cases of movement disorders. For treatment outcomes to be optimized and to resolve patient distress, prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential.",

Apesar destas alterações, a maioria dos idosos está satisfeita com sua vida, e não tem predisposição psicológica para desenvolver transtornos de humor. Entretanto, frente às vicissitudes do envelhecimento, alguns idosos podem apresentar um quadro de depressão maior, transtorno de humor bipolar, ciclotimia, distimia ou simplesmente apresentar “sintomas depressivos clinicamente significativos”, sendo importante a diferenciação entre quadros de início precoce e início tardio, além de se determinar a presença de causas ou complicadores orgânicos. Sabe-se que este adoecimento se deve a uma predisposição psíquica, mas também a uma associação dos sintomas com doenças clínicas, uso crônico de medicamentos e estressores psicossociais, situações mais frequentes nesta população quando comparados aos adultos jovens. As taxas de depressão em pacientes idosos, por exemplo, variam de 3,5% a 7,0% e representam um problema de saúde pública, tendo em vista seu impacto na saúde dos pacientes e a piora da qualidade de vida. O presente artigo tem o objetivo de descrever as características clínicas dos transtornos de humor em idosos, visando à promoção de um diagnóstico precoce, salientando as principais diferenças em relação aos adultos jovens, seja na qualidade ou intensidade dos sintomas, orientando os profissionais de saúde que atendem esta população de pacientes.",

Alzheimer disease is the leading cause and prototypical form of dementia, presenting insidiously and causing progressive cognitive impairment with increasing severity over a period of years. Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia and often co-occurs with other progressive cognitive disorders. Lewy body dementias encompass Parkinson disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, which have similar features and are differentiated primarily by the order of motor and cognitive symptom onset. Frontotemporal dementias occur earlier than other forms of dementia, progress rapidly, and often have a genetic component.

Disturbed sleep can result in fatigue, irritability, morning headaches, impaired motor and cognitive skills, depression, and daytime somnolence. The major sleep complaints include insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia, excessive nocturnal motor activity, circadian sleep–wake rhythm disturbance, and respiratory dysrhythmia. The pathogenetic mechanisms of sleep disturbances may be secondary to direct structural alteration of the sleep–wake generating neurons or from several other indirect mechanisms. At the biochemical level, neurodegenerative diseases may be largely classified as tauopathies, α-synucleinopathies, and other diseases. Overnight polysomnography (PSG), Multiple Sleep Latency Test, Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, and actigraphy are some important diagnostic laboratory tests in the evaluation of sleep disturbances. Management of sleep disturbances is complex and is based primarily on the nature of the sleep disturbance. The clinical profiles, pathogenetic mechanisms, PSG findings, and management issues are discussed here with reference to some common neurodegenerative diseases.",

It is a multidetermined biopsychosocial disorder in which physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors may contribute to the clinical expression of the disorder. These can include: (1) early life (e.g., genetic or environmental) factors; (2) physiological factors including increased motor reactivity, visceral hypersensitivity, which may be enabled by postinfectious events, and dysregulation of brain–gut communication (e.g., altered central pain control mechanisms). In addition, psychosocial factors including psychiatric co-morbidity, major trauma (e.g., abuse history), and maladaptive coping may amplify the clinical expression of the disorder and its outcome. Currently, clinical outcome has become understood in terms of global symptom relief and health-related quality of life.",

Firstly, it may be distinguished from other causes of peripheral motor involvement such as muscle diseases and disorders of the neuromuscular junction. Secondly, it may be discussed in two different forms: acute and chronic. Acute chronic neuropathies are mainly observed in Guillain‐Barré syndrome, in which electrophysiological studies allow us to recognize the classical demyelinating form and the axonal form. The other causes of acute motor neuropathy are mainly poliomyelitis and porphyrias. Chronic motor neuropathies are mainly observed in motor neuron diseases, mainly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but also Kennedy’s disease and other lower motor neuron diseases which may be inherited or acquired. The other causes are multifocal motor neuropathy and the predominantly motor forms of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The characterization of these different types of chronic neuropathy is of major importance because of the therapeutic consequences which may lead to the proposal of specific treatments.",

      "title": "Diagnosis of Mechanical Low Back Pain in a Laborer",
      "abstract": "Patients are commonly referred to physical therapy for work-related mechanical low back pain (LBP). Technological advances (eg, diagnostic imaging) for identifying pathology of the spine have not decreased the time period in which symptoms resolve nor do they guide physical therapy treatment. Treatment of low back pain is often influenced by the bias of individual physical therapists, and care is often based on unproven techniques. The patient's distress and illness behavior, socioeconomic and job status, previous surgeries, and chronicity of LBP can influence the outcome of treatment, but there is little evidence to support the correlation between structural pathophysiology identified by diagnostic testing and the disability status of patients with LBP. Medical diagnosis (eg, herniated nucleus pulposis, spondylolisthesis) has not been helpful in directing successful rehabilitation of patients with LBP. Identifying the exact tissues responsible for the LBP, therefore, should not be the goal of clinical assessment. Several studies suggest that an assessment-based treatment scheme provides a better outcome than a nonspecific treatment approach. Selection of assessment-based treatments depends on both the patient's history and an elucidation of the movements and mechanical stresses that reproduce the patient's symptoms. Recent research has supported the concept of prescribing exercise by matching the therapy to the motions that cause or relieve symptoms. The goal of exercise prescription based on repeated motion testing of the spine is to use the findings of the exam and movement testing to create a specific program to restore function. This rational approach to exercise prescription should theoretically result in faster resolution of symptoms and shorter episodes of care than nonspecific exercise programs. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the usefulness of a classification system, described by Delitto et al, for determining appropriate treatment in a patient with recent onset of LBP and to describe how the diagnostic process influenced treatment choices.

      "title": "Heavy Metal Encephalopathy Masquerading as Hepatic Encephalopathy – A Case Report",
      "abstract": "In this case report we discuss a patient with neurological manifestations thought to be a case of hepatic encephalopathy. With no improvement in symptoms despite treatment, it created a diagnostic dilemma. Eventually, toxicological investigations were done which revealed that heavy metal poisoning could be the possible culprit. Encephalopathy is characterised by impaired mental state as a result of a diffuse brain dysfunction or other psychiatric condition that induces unconsciousness, typically followed by diffuse electroencephalogram (EEG) anomalies. Both primary neurological and systemic disorders are root causes of encephalopathy. Encephalopathy results from several causes such as liver failure or liver cancer, metabolic abnormalities, anoxic encephalopathy, infections, exposure to harmful compounds such as lithium paint, synthetic contaminants (toxins), inflammations (systemic lupus erythematous, sarcoidosis), drug induced, demyelination (e.g., multiple sclerosis), degenerative process like Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease and hereditary encephalopathies such as leukodystrophy of the white matter. 1 Humans have used heavy metals since many years. While many harmful health effects of heavy metals have long been established, exposure to heavy metals continues to rise in some parts of the world, especially in underdeveloped countries. Emissions have decreased over the past 100 years in most developed countries. Heavy metals are prevalent and remain in the ecosystem, in general causing bio amplification. Living systems frequently associate with heavy metals in different proportions in the habitat. Heavy metal exposure induces lipid peroxidation, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) damage and protein modification by generation of oxygen free radicals. Exposure to these metals occurs in occupational areas by equipment, air, food and drinking water. Prolonged exposure to heavy metals may lead to neurotoxicity and brain damage. When symptoms of toxic encephalopathy emerge immediately following single acute exposure to high levels of toxic chemicals it is termed as acute toxic encephalopathy. Other than that if symptoms emerge insidiously over time in association with repeated or chronic exposure to low levels of neurotoxins it is called as chronic toxic encephalopathy. 2 In some cases, diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy is complicated by the fact that toxic chemicals can also damage liver and kidneys. In these cases hepatic dysfunction must be successfully treated before diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy can be considered. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, so a full work up for other possible aetiologies such as hepatic, uremic and infectious should be done. In this case report we have discussed heavy metal encephalopathy masquerading as hepatic dysfunction.",

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause and can often be diagnosed clinically. The clinical suspicion of vascular dementia has to be confirmed by imaging methods. Drug intoxication may cause or contribute to dementia. Blood tests should be performed routinely, but EEG, CT or MRI, SPECT and genetic tests can be carried out on clinical indication. Subsequently the need for care of the patient has to be established, as well as the ability of the carers to meet it. Regular follow-up is necessary. A definite diagnosis can only be made post-mortem when neuropathological examination has been performed.

      "title": "The Role of EEG in the Erroneous Diagnosis of Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Errors in diagnosis are relatively common in medicine and occur in all specialties. The consequences can be serious for both patients and physicians. Errors in neurology are often because of the overemphasis on 'tests' over the clinical picture. The diagnosis of epilepsy in general is a clinical one and is typically based on history. Epilepsy is more commonly overdiagnosed than underdiagnosed. An erroneous diagnosis of epilepsy is often the result of weak history and an 'abnormal' EEG. Twenty-five to 30% of patients previously diagnosed with epilepsy who did not respond to initial antiepileptic drug treatment do not have epilepsy. Most patients misdiagnosed with epilepsy turn out to have either psychogenic nonepileptic attacks or syncope. Reasons for reading a normal EEG as an abnormal one include over-reading normal variants or simple fluctuations of background rhythms. Reversing the diagnosis of epilepsy is challenging and requires reviewing the 'abnormal' EEG, which can be difficult. The lack of mandatory training in neurology residency programs is one of the main reasons for normal EEGs being over-read as abnormal. Tests (including EEG) should not be overemphasized over clinical judgment. The diagnosis of epilepsy can be challenging, and some seizure types may be underdiagnosed. Frontal lobe hypermotor seizures may be misdiagnosed as psychogenic events. Focal unaware cognitive seizures in elderly maybe be blamed on dementia, and ictal or interictal psychosis in frontal and temporal lobe epilepsies may be mistaken for a primary psychiatric disorder.",

The development of neuropsychological deficits depends on the type of seizures. Particularly BNS-seizures and the Lennox-Gastaut-syndrome have generally a poor prognosis concerning the intellectual development. Not only clinically manifest seizures but also subclinical discharges could disturb the psychic condition of epileptic patients. Epileptic seizures are probably a reason for neuronal damage in the hippocampus area.

      "title": "The Neuropathic Diathesis, or the Diathesis of the Degenerate",
      "abstract": "I think that the foregoing statistics, and those which follow, together with the large number of cases which I quote, and which connect general paralysis with almost every form of neurotic manifestation, will prove conclusively that neurotic inheritance is a striking feature in the causation of general paralysis. I question whether a distinction between “the cerebral and the insane element” in general paralysis can be maintained. If general paralysis is not a degeneration of the mind-tissue, then the pathology of insanity has no existence, and I would say that the subtle influence for evil, which is transmitted from parents, whose brains are deteriorated by neurotic outbursts, or soaked in alcohol, or wrecked by physiological immorality, tends strongly towards such degeneration. If insanity is, as Dr. Savage says, a perversion of the ego, then a general paralytic is the in-sanest of the insane. We know that the children of a melancholic parent, for example, may develop any form of neurosis—in other words, it is not that melancholia or general paralysis, or any other definite disease, is transmitted, but that a certain tendency to deviate from normal development is transmitted. This tendency to deviate is the neurotic diathesis, and the form of its development is determined by collateral circumstances, and a certain series of collateral circumstances determine the development of general paralysis. Perhaps neurotic inheritance may mean in some cases a limited capital of nervous energy, and if this is wasted recklessly the individual breaks down suddenly and pathologically, as we all do slowly and physiologically. I would also point out that considering the number of histories of insanity which owing to ignorance or reticence we, do not receive, and considering that we never receive information as to the existence of the slighter neuroses, it is marvellous that we get so high a percentage as 51. Of the 145 general paralytics with a reliable history, 38 had a family history of insanity, 28 a family history of drink, 8 of both, 43 had a personal history of drink, 8 of a previous attack too remote to be considered, at least, according to our present ideas, as part of the disease, and the vast majority had a history of some physiological irregularity which must be considered as conducive to the creation of an acquired neurosis. We may now pass to some further statistics.",

      "abstract": "Depressive Storungen konnen neben den Erstrangsymptomen „depressive Stimmung“, „Verlust von Interesse oder Freude“ und „erhohte Ermudbarkeit“ mit einer grosen Anzahl an weiteren Symptomen einhergehen. Folgende kognitive Defizite sind kennzeichnend: Storungen der kognitiven Flexibilitat, des Arbeitsgedachtnisses, des freien Abrufs von Gedachtnisinhalten, der geteilten Aufmerksamkeit und von Teilbereichen der selektiven Aufmerksamkeit.\nDie Bundesanstalt fur Strasenwesen (BASt) und wissenschaftliche Forschungsarbeiten konnten eine Reihe an Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen identifizieren, welche eine ausreichende psychische Leistungsfahigkeit im Strasenverkehr gewahrleisten sollen. Obwohl sich die hierbei hervorgehobenen kognitiven Leistungsfunktionen nahezu umfassend mit den Defizitbereichen bei depressiven Storungen uberschneiden und bisher kein rein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen der Schwere der depressiven Symptomatik und dem Auspragungsgrad kognitiver Beeintrachtigungen gefunden werden konnte, besagt die aktuelle Rechtslage, dass lediglich bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung anzuzweifeln sei.\nZiele der vorliegenden Arbeit: Zum einen sollte uberpruft werden, ob sich die in der Literatur berichteten Unterschiede zwischen depressiven Patienten und gesunden Vergleichspersonen in der kognitiven Leistungsfahigkeit, bei der Fahrkompetenz, bei der Selbstbeschreibung und im Risikoverhalten finden lassen. Zum anderen wurde zu bestimmen versucht, welche dieser Mase hauptverantwortlich fur Unterschiede in der Fahrkompetenz sind.\nMethode: Hierzu bearbeitete eine Gruppe stationar-psychiatrischer Patienten mit unipolarer Depression jeweils unmittelbar nach stationarer Aufnahme und bei Entlassung (neuro-) psychologische Testverfahren. Daruber hinaus wurde zeitnah zu den Testungen eine praktische Fahrerprobung in einem Fahrschulauto durchgefuhrt. Ein dritter Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, die wissenschaftliche Gute dieser praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe zu uberprufen. Alle Untersuchungen wurden parallel auch mit einer Kontrollgruppe korperlich und psychisch gesunder Probanden durchgefuhrt. \nErgebnisse: Die Fahrverhaltensprobe konnte strenge wissenschaftliche und verkehrspsychologische Anforderungen erfullen. Es zeigte sich, dass sich die Patienten neben dem Ausmas ihrer subjektiven und objektiven Depressivitat, auch in einer Reihe von Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen von den Kontrollpersonen unterschieden. Es liesen sich sowohl einzelne wie auch Kombinationen an Variablen identifizieren, die bereits fur die eher geringe Stichprobengrose der Studie die Fahrkompetenz der Probanden mit einem zufrieden stellenden Mas an Sensitivitat und Spezifitat vorhersagten. \nDiskussion: Mit dieser Arbeit wurde erstmals bei Patienten mit mittelschwerer Depression sowohl anhand neuropsychologischer Testverfahren als auch mit Hilfe einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe untersucht, welche Auswirkungen deren Erkrankung auf die Fahrkompetenz hat. Vorangegangene Studien konnten aber bereits die Annahme der BASt, dass nur bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung fraglich sei, deutlich in Frage stellen. Die vorliegende Studie stutzt die bisherigen Erkenntnisse und zeigt zusatzlich auf, dass auch bei einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe, die den Anforderungen der BASt entspricht, nicht von vergleichbaren Leistungen bei depressiven Patienten und gesunden Kontrollen auszugehen ist. Die geringe Stichprobengrose lasst allerdings eine Generalisierung der Ergebnisse nicht zu. Weitere Forschungsarbeit in dieser Richtung ist erforderlich.",

We describe a case difficult to diagnose because of apathy, due to a brain tumour in the right frontal lobe, diagnosed as depression. Another difficulty, rather suggesting mood disorder, was rheumatoid arthritis.

In the past two decades, the advent of extensive neuropsychological test batteries that reliably assess brain function and underlying central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction has contributed significantly to our understanding of the clinical features of many neurologic and psychiatric disorders such as TS. Recent evidence has suggested that the commonly observed comorbid behavioral disorders of TS, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), clearly have an impact on cognitive, educational, and psychosocial fun~tion.',~~,'~ Moreover, these behavioral features of TS can be more debilitating than the cardinal motor features (i.e., tics) of the disorder and require careful clinical assessment so that appropriate treatment interventions can be offered to patients and their families. Current opinion regarding the treatment of TS recommends targeting the most disabling feature(s), which in many cases turn out to be ADHD and/or OCD.52 This article focuses on objective neuropsychological and behavioral assessment of OCD and ADHD, which is useful for both the clinical evaluation and treatment of OCD and ADHD associated with TS and in the research setting.",

      "abstract": "The terms myofascial pain, fibromyalgia and fibrositis are critically examined. They constitute diagnostic labels for non-specific musculoskeletal aches and pains. Analysis of the evidence shows that none of these labels is substantiated by hard physical signs or by laboratory evidence of consistent pathological or biochemical abnormality. What is the objective evidence for disorder(s) of muscle, fascia or fibrous tissues, so clearly indicated by these diagnostic names? Alternative terms such as ‘regional pain syndrome’ or ‘chronic pain syndrome’ merely redefine the clinical problem without providing a mechanism or basis for diagnosis. Despite different diagnostic criteria, these conditions, along with chronic fatigue syndrome, have many demographic and clinical similarities, most notably tender trigger points. Indeed, the terms are often used interchangeably. There are few differences in the symptoms, physical findings, laboratory tests, functional status, psychosocial features and psychiatric disorders. This paper seeks not to deny the existence of aches and pains, but to critically examine the utility of these terms. The only claimed physical sign is the presence of tender trigger points over muscles or muscle attachments. Research suggests that tender points are a measure of general distress related to pain complaints but separately associated with fatigue and depression. They are present in some normal subjects and are variable in occurrence in time in the same individual. They reflect no demonstrable pathology. It is therefore argued that none of these commonly used diagnoses represent distinct disease entities. A possible but unproven alternative hypothesis is that such symptoms relate to neural pain with both peripheral and central components, and in some instances psychological or wilful embellishment.",

Few studies have examined clinicopathologic correlations between phosphorylated-tau neurofibrillary tangles, β-amyloid neuritic plaques, neuroinflammation, or white matter (WM) lesions, and neuropsychiatric disorders in veterans. We describe clinicopathologic findings in 4 military veterans with early-onset dementia (EOD) who had varying histories of blunt- and blast-TBI, cognitive decline, behavioral abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, and suicide. We found that pathologic lesions in these military-EOD cases could not be categorized as classic Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy, traumatic axonal injury, or other well-characterized clinicopathologic entities. Rather, we observed a mixture of polypathology with unusual patterns compared with pathologies found in AD or other dementias. Also, ultrahigh resolution ex vivo MRI in 2 of these 4 brains revealed unusual patterns of periventricular WM injury. These findings suggest that military-EOD cases are associated with atypical combinations of brain lesions and distribution rarely seen in nonmilitary populations. Future prospective studies that acquire neuropsychiatric data before and after deployments, as well as genetic and environmental exposure data, are needed to further elucidate clinicopathologic correlations in military-EOD.",

      "title": "Accelerated biological aging in serious mental disorders",
      "abstract": "Individuals with serious mental disorders (SMDs) die at an earlier average age, even after controlling for suicide1. They are also at increased risk for developing somatic diseases that are typically associated with advanced age, such as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, immune dysregulation and dementia1. The causes of this are likely multi-factorial, including genetic predisposition, biological changes set in motion by early life adversity, and lifestyle factors. Lifestyle factors, while obviously important, do not fully explain the increased mortality and morbidity in these individuals, and consequently, \"accelerated biological aging\" is increasingly being seen as an intrinsic factor in SMDs, at least in some individuals2, 3. To the extent this hypothesis is true, the scope of pathophysiology in these illnesses would broaden considerably, and they might no longer be framed as only \"mental disorders\" or even brain diseases, but rather as whole-body, multi-system illnesses (or at least as illnesses with substantial somatic comorbidity), of which the psychiatric presentation is just the most readily observable pathology3. Understanding the mediators of such potential acceleration of aging should expand preventative and therapeutic opportunities to improve physical as well as mental health in affected individuals. The notion of accelerated biological aging in SMDs is supported by reports of acceleration of certain biomarkers of age, such as leukocyte telomere length2 and epigenetic age4. However, data on these biomarkers remain relatively sparse to this point, and several questions arise: a) Do these markers measure aging per se, or just the presence of factors that themselves mediate aging? b) Are these markers causally related to SMDs or just correlated with them? c) Is accelerated aging specific to particular psychiatric diagnoses or to certain physiological perturbations that traverse diagnostic boundaries? d) Do different aging biomarkers reflect the same or different underlying aging processes? Here I briefly review recent data pertinent to these questions. Leukocyte telomere length and epigenetic age both significantly track chronological age, with correlation coefficients of −0.38 to −0.51 (for the former) and 0.96 (for the latter). Both of these markers significantly predict disease and mortality, strengthening the view that they are measurable markers of the aging process and of rates of aging. However, leukocyte telomere length and epigenetic age are independent predictors of chronological age and mortality risk5. Therefore, while they both measure processes that evolve with aging or are associated with aging, the specific processes are different, and their underlying mediators likely differ. Telomere shortening can occur in response to inflammation, oxidative stress, stress hormones and other factors2, 3. As such, it may signal the cumulative presence of a toxic cellular environment, rather than directly informing on the aging process itself. Indeed, leukocyte telomere length is often found to be inversely correlated with circulating inflammatory and oxidative stress factors2, 3. Another major determinant of telomere shortening is a cell's mitotic history, since telomeres fail to fully replicate after each cell division, unless acted upon by the intracellular enzyme telomerase. When cells reach a critically short telomere length, they may undergo replicative senescence, apoptosis, genomic instability or oncogenic transformation2. This can be especially problematic in tissues whose mitotic capacity is necessary for cellular replacement, such as hematopoietic stem cells and – of particular relevance to psychiatry – neuronal stem cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Of great concern (and also of great preventative opportunity), early life stress, even in utero, has been associated with shortened leukocyte telomere length in newborns and in adults. Telomeres in SMDs may progressively shorten with illness chronicity and/or severity, but, interestingly, even never-depressed girls at high genetic risk for developing depression already have short telomeres compared to girls at low genetic risk6, suggesting a genetic (or epigenetic) link to telomere shortening even before illness onset, and raising the possibility that short telomeres are a risk factor for developing certain SMDs. Telomerase has non-canonical effects unrelated to telomere lengthening, and may, in fact, have direct anti-aging, neurotrophic and antidepressant effects7. Human studies are just beginning to explore whether telomerase activation provides such benefits in humans or mediates the therapeutic effects of certain psychotropic drugs8. Epigenetic age is a more recent candidate marker of the aging process, owing largely to the discovery of an \"epigenetic clock\" by Horvath4 that remarkably tracks chronological age in humans and also predicts all-cause mortality. This \"clock\" is based on progressive age-related changes in methylation of 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) sites at specific DNA loci. While largely pre-programmed, methylation of these sites is also influenced by the environment. Considerably less work has been reported on epigenetic age in SMDs compared to leukocyte telomere length, and the findings are not entirely consistent. However, as was the case with telomere shortening, epigenetic age is apparently accelerated following life stress, perhaps even prenatal stress, and this might be related to glucocorticoid effects on methylation9. Although not strictly a biomarker of aging, another set of relevant subcellular biomarkers involves the mitochondria, which are related to the aging process, are affected by stress and glucocorticoids, interact with telomere length and telomerase, and are likely dysregulated in SMDs. Mitochondrial pathology may be assessed by mitochondrial mutations, inefficient energy generation, increased reactive oxygen species generation and altered mitochondrial DNA copy number. Although widely studied in somatic diseases, the characterization of mitochondria in SMDs is in its infancy, some results are conflicting, and the relationship of mitochondria to epigenetic age and leukocyte telomere length is actively being investigated10. In summary, the landscape of psychiatric illness is changing, with a new focus on subcellular components and processes in addition to neurotransmitters. All or nearly all of the biomarkers discussed here lack diagnostic specificity, but may, rather, be specific to particular biochemical disturbances (e.g., glucocorticoids, inflammation, oxidative stress) that contribute to psychiatric illnesses. Such studies are reinforcing the concept that purely phenomenologic diagnoses may obscure biological underpinnings of psychiatric pathology. The biomarkers discussed here are usually studied in peripheral leukocytes or in saliva. While the relationship between these peripheral markers and brain markers is uncertain, they likely have import in their own right, and may contribute to somatic as well as psychiatric presentations. A key area of investigation is to determine whether biological aging in SMDs can be decelerated with appropriate treatment. When psychiatrists and other clinicians view mental illnesses as whole body diseases, the focus will change from specific behaviors to systemic, whole body pathologies, and personalized medicine will increasingly match target-based therapies to specific biological indicators.

      "abstract": "Functional somatic syndromes are increasingly diagnosed in chronically ill patients presenting with an array of symptoms not attributed to physical ailments. Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome are common disorders that belong in this broad category. Such syndromes are characterised by the presence of one or multiple chronic symptoms including widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and abdominal pain, amongst other issues. Symptoms are believed to relate to a complex interaction of biological and psychosocial factors, where a definite aetiology has not been established. Theories suggest causative pathways between the immune and nervous systems of affected individuals with several risk factors identified in patients presenting with one or more functional syndromes. Risk factors including stress and childhood trauma are now recognised as important contributors to chronic pain conditions. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse during childhood is considered a severe stressor having a high prevalence in functional somatic syndrome suffers. Such trauma permanently alters the biological stress response of the suffers leading to neuroexcitatory and other nerve issues associated with chronic pain in adults. Traumatic and chronic stress results in epigenetic changes in stress response genes, which ultimately leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system manifesting in a broad array of symptoms. Importantly, these systems are known to be dysregulated in patients suffering from functional somatic syndrome. Functional somatic syndromes are also highly prevalent co-morbidities of psychiatric conditions, mood disorders, and anxiety. Consequently, this review aims to provide insight into the role of the nervous system and immune system in chronic pain disorders associated with the musculoskeletal system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.",

      "abstract": "In bipolar disorder (BD), illness progression has been associated with a higher number of mood episodes and hospitalizations, reduced interepisode intervals, poorer response to treatment, and cognitive/functional impairment. The term ‘neuroprogression” has been proposed to describe the pathological rewiring of the brain that takes place when clinical and cognitive deterioration occurs in the context of the progression of BD. Accordingly, neuroprogression would correspond to the biological underpinnings of illness progression and staging in BD. In some cases of BD it is possible to identify an active process of neuroprogression mediated by immune activation which cincludes: a) inflammation, b) changes in growth factors, c) oxidative stress and d) mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent evidence showing neuroinflammation in BD suggest that it may be associated with neuroprogressive changes such as incremental volume loss in brain, cognitive changes, and a declining likelihood of response to pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. Prompt treatment may be potentially neuroprotective and attenuate the volumetric and neurocognitive changes that emerge with chronicity. Accumulating evidence suggest that the assessment of immune activation in BD may be a means to assess illness progression. Interventions aiming at reducing immune activation in BD are currently being tested.",

      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Hallucination is a sensory perception that occurs in the absence of external stimuli during abnormal neurological disturbances and various mental diseases. Hallucination is recognized as a core psychotic symptom and is particularly more prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia. Strikingly, a significant number of subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and other neurological diseases like cerebral stroke and epileptic seizure also experience hallucination. While aberrant neurotransmission has been linked to the neuropathogenic events of schizophrenia, the precise cellular mechanism accounting for hallucinations remains obscure. Neurogenesis is a cellular process of producing new neurons from the neural stem cells (NSC)-derived neuroblasts in the brain that contribute to the regulation of pattern separation, mood, olfaction, learning, and memory in adulthood. Impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the adult brain has been linked to stress, anxiety, depression, and dementia. Notably, many neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the mitotic and functional activation of neuroblasts and cell cycle re-entry of mature neurons leading to a drastic alteration in neurogenic process, known as reactive neuroblastosis. Considering their neurophysiological properties, the abnormal integration of neuroblasts into the existing neural network or withdrawal of their connections can lead to abnormal synaptogenesis, and neurotransmission. Eventually, this would be expected to result in altered perception accounting for hallucination. Thus, this article emphasizes a hypothesis that aberrant neurogenic processes at the level of reactive neuroblastosis could be an underlying mechanism of hallucination in schizophrenia and other neurological diseases.",

      "abstract": "Le trouble d'adaptation (TA) est un diagnostic defini par le DSM comme une reaction psychologique a un evenement de vie penible. Sa prevalence clinique est relativement elevee en premiere ligne medicale ou il fait parfois figure de diagnostic officieux de « depression mineure » et d' « epuisement professionnel ». Bien que le TA soit un diagnostic frequemment utilise en clinique medicale, il demeure relativement peu etudie. A peine une centaine de publications scientifiques abordent le diagnostic dans des revues savantes depuis son introduction en 1980. Un tel chiffre contraste avec les milliers d'etudes menees sur les autres diagnostics psychiatriques dont la prevalence est comparable, notamment la depression majeure. Cette faible attention scientifique portee au TA interpelle plusieurs chercheurs. La principale hypothese retenue jusqu'a maintenant pour expliquer ce phenomene est le caractere non specifique de la definition du TA qui entrainerait des obstacles methodologiques significatifs. Cependant, plusieurs autres attributs du diagnostic paraissent susceptibles de limiter son etude, dont sa nature relativement benigne vis-a-vis des autres troubles psychiatriques. Afin d'eclaircir les raisons derriere la faible attention scientifique portee au TA, nous avons procede a une analyse de contenu thematique de la litterature scientifique abordant specifiquement le diagnostic. Nous avons ainsi recolte cent quinze textes publies dans des revues savantes depuis trente ans ayant l'expression « trouble d'adaptation » dans leur titre. Apres categorisation des textes scientifiques et identification des principales dimensions substantives associees au TA, nous avons pu degager les principaux attributs du diagnostic susceptibles de repondre a notre question de recherche. Cette etude, qui propose un regard sociologique inedit sur le diagnostic du TA, laisse voir que la faible attention scientifique dont il est l'objet est le produit de plusieurs facteurs. D'abord, bien que defini par la psychiatrie, l'objet d'etude que represente TA se derobe vraisemblablement de cette specialite medicale par son profil phenomenologique mineur, par l'absence de substrat biologique associe ainsi que par l'approche pharmacotherapeutique minimale qu'on preconise a l'egard du diagnostic. Ensuite, l'ambiguite fondamentale qui caracterise le TA, le savoir tacite du DSM que requiert son etude ainsi que le benefice que le diagnostic retire d'une forme d'invisibilite contribuent aussi a reduire l'extension de la recherche a son endroit. \r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : trouble d'adaptation, diagnostic, depression, clinique, psychiatrie",

Research studies have shown the association between sleep disorders and day time cognitive impairment, behavioral problems, poor school performance and inattention in children. Appropriate diagnosis and early management of sleep disorders in children lead to improvement of neurocognitive function and behavioral problems in these children.",

      "abstract": "Any attempt to describe the neurological signs of ageing immediately prompts a number of challenging questions. Some neurological signs particularly associated with ageing are briefly described, along with details of their investigational correlates and neuroanatomical substrates where these are known. The description follows the traditional and somewhat arbitrary sequence of the neurological examination, beginning with elemental(sensorimotor) functions and then proceeding to higher mental (cognitive) functions. A decrease in the sensitivity of vibratory perception is the most prominent age-related finding on sensory examination, particularly distally and more so in the legs than the arms. Longitudinal studies of healthy individuals show a decline in cognitive function with age. Longitudinal studies with detailed phenotyping may reveal more about the ageing process.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are both common and consequential, but too often remain undiagnosed. The insidious, chronic course of most sleep disorders and lack of patient awareness of signs and symptoms during sleep can complicate the clinical evaluation. Typical chief complaints include snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and behaviors during sleep. Sleep disorders can be primary or secondary to medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is often desirable. Family members can be a critical source of information as they may have observed nocturnal or daytime symptoms unrecognized by the patient. Objective testing plays an important role in assessment for obstructive sleep apnea, parasomnias, and other specific sleep disorders, and can be used most effectively in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation. Nonsleep specialists should consider obtaining assistance from sleep clinicians for more challenging presentations or management of sleep disorders unfamiliar to them.",

However, other studies have not supported this finding, and the research in this area is complicated by methodological differences and inconsistencies in the classification of \"cognitive\" and \"somatic\" symptoms. In addition, somatic symptoms are more common than cognitive symptoms in cardiac patients and are often associated with more severe depression. These factors may confound the relationship between somatic symptoms and cardiac outcomes. Some reasons why somatic symptoms may be more common than cognitive symptoms in cardiac patients are considered, as well as whether somatic symptoms are likely to be symptoms of depression or of medical illness. Finally, some directions for future research are proposed.",

      "title": "Limb weakness",
      "abstract": "The definition of weakness is important, because many patients who self-describe a ‘weak limb’ will actually have a clumsy limb (ataxia), a numb limb (reduced sensation), or a limb that is too painful to move. The time course of the onset of the symptoms in general reflects the time course of the underlying pathology: • Sudden onset (seconds to minutes) usually implies either trauma (e.g. displaced vertebral fractures due to major trauma) or certain vascular insults (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA)). • Subacute onset (hours to days) suggests a progressive demyelination (e.g. Guillain–Barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis) or a slowly expanding haematoma (e.g. subdural haematoma). • Chronic onset (weeks to months), is consistent with pathologies such as a slow-growing tumour or motor neuron disease (progressive degeneration of motor neurons). As only acute and subacute limb weakness will present acutely to generalists in hospital (chronic onset cases will most likely be referred to neurology from primary care), we have limited the chapter to these cases. Limb movement requires an intact pathway from the cerebral cortex, down the corona radiata, internal capsule, and pons, along the corticospinal tract of the spinal cord, out along a nerve root, and down a peripheral nerve to the neuromuscular junction and muscle itself. If a patient has limb weakness, there must be a lesion somewhere in this pathway. Figure 26.2 gives the differential diagnosis for limb weakness. Mr Walker has presented with rapid onset of left-sided arm weakness. Key clues in the history to elicit include: • Exact time of onset? This is critical in suspected strokes because the window of time in which to confirm the diagnosis and administer thrombolysis (if appropriate) is only 4.5 hours from onset of symptoms (after that, you risk doing more harm than good to the patient). If you suspect a stroke in a patient within that time frame, call the thrombolysis team immediately. In this case, all we can say is that the onset was at some point in the 7 hours between 11 p.m. (when he went to sleep) and 6 a.m. (when he woke up), so we cannot confidently say the onset was within 4.5 hours.",

There are many types of sleep disorders; most commonly, they are associated with problems with falling asleep and maintaining sleep continuity, or more complex disorders, such as parasomnias, breathing disorders and movement disorders associated with sleep. In the following work, we have focused on sleep problems in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). These patients more often than healthy people of the same age complain about sleep disorders and these dis­orders increase with the progress of the disease and the appearance of other symptoms. Depressed mood, chronic fatigue, pain and urinary problems significantly affect the quality of sleep in patients with MS. On the other hand, excessive sleepiness and trouble with falling asleep intensify the feeling of fatigue, which is a major problem and impair cognitive functions. However, sleep-related symptoms are often overlooked during medical visits due to other symptoms of multiple sclerosis, especially those causing motor disability. The treatment of sleep disorders in patients with MS is based on basic methods used in the general population. In the treatment of sleep disorders in patients with multiple sclerosis, appropriate disease modifying therapy is also important.",

It is the most frequent reason for referring children to mental health services. Core symptoms of AD/HD (inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) present behaviors that parents may rate in standardized questionnaires (e.g., does not study, memory problems, cannot concentrate, cannot stay still, has no motives, etc.), are also present in other developmental or psychiatric disorders (e.g., specific learning difficulties, sensory modulation disorder, mood or anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders). This may cause errors in the differential diagnosis if clinicians do not add objective measures of cognitive deficits associated with each disorder. AD/HD presents neuropsychological deficits (compared to non-clinical populations) that are also present in other disorders, like deficient working memory, whereas other neuropsychological deficits are unique characteristics of AD/HD, such as sustained attention, response inhibition, and variability of response time. Likewise, anxiety disorders present neuropsychological deficits in autobiographical memory, mood disorders present neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and verbal memory. Neuropsychological tests such as the Continuous Performance Test, tests of reading phonetic decoding, and others, may improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis, differentiating AD/HD from other disorders, or revealing the comorbidity of AD/HD with other disorders.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "abstract": "Accessible summary As people get older, many are not able to move as quickly as they used to and many find it harder to think about how to sort their problems. Sometimes people develop what is called dementia. If someone has dementia then you may notice changes in their memory or how they behave. There are a few kinds of dementia – one is called Alzheimer’s dementia; another is called vascular dementia; another is called Lewy Body dementia. If people have these illnesses they find that gradually they are not as able to do the things they used to. They may forget more things like people’s names or how to make their tea. There are other illnesses that can look a bit like these dementia illnesses and sometimes it is hard to tell if someone has a dementia illness or if they have some other illness instead of or as well as the dementia. Many of these illnesses can be helped with medicine or with the right sort of support so it is important to sort out just what it is that is making the problem for the person. If someone really does have a dementia illness then staff members need to know this so they can help the person. Sometimes this means moving into a different house or having different staff members who understand the difficulties. Sometimes it is hard to find the right place for a person to live. This is because if they have dementia, then as they get older they may need more and more help. The man in this paper was not able to speak to people but the writer used something called Talking Mats. When there is an important time in their life when they have to choose what they would like to do, Talking Mats is a way to find what a person wants without them speaking, by using pictures. Summary Assessment for a diagnosis of dementia is hard enough under the best possible conditions. There are possible alternative or concomitant diagnoses, such as depression, to consider. However, when the possible dementia concerns a gentleman with severe learning disabilities and with a severe communication disorder then this assessment becomes even more difficult. Still more complications may arise from practical pressures such as general changes in health and hence of support needs; changes in support staff; what housing options are available at the time; and what options are or may be available in anticipation of future needs. This brief case‐study highlights the difficulties and competing pressures that complicate further just such a differential diagnosis.",

      "title": "When Psychological Tests Do Not Detect Test-Detectable Brain Damage: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "In a previous presentation1), I discussed some of the problems in detecting and measuring the psychological effects of brain damage. This paper is a report and discussion of the case of a child whose easily detectable brain-damaged state was a significant factor in the production of a psychiatric disturbance. Yet, it had gone undetected in preceding medical, psychiatric, and psychological examinations. There is a sizable group of both children and adults whose personality difficulties are rooted in a variety of unrecognized brain-damage conditions. Many of these hidden conditions are referable to pre-natal malformation, developmental error, congenital or very early childhood traumata, febrile or pediatric diseases affecting cerebral functioning. Frequently these conditions are simply not recognizable on routine medical and neurological examination. Yet, such unsuspected states of central neuropathology often constitute a large silent sector of the psychopathology which confronts us at the point of diagnostic evaluation. Alertness to the existence of this group of cases and the practice of certain standards of careful clinical study will help uncover some of the less cryptic cases which might otherwise pass by undiscovered. The diagnostic study of all children seen in the Department of Child Psychiatry of The Menninger Foundation includes extensive psychiatric assessment, a full scale psychological test battery, medical examination, laboratory studies, and neurological consultation including X-rays and electroencephalographic tracings. This may seem unnecessarily elaborate. But experience has shown that in the long run the principle of diagnostic insurance pays off periodically in the discovery of brain-centered disorders of crucial consequence to the understanding of the case and its ultimate therapeutic possibilities. Bypassing of subtle or marginal organic brain conditions is more frequent in children, since comprehensive diagnostic facilities are generally not available to pediatricians and family physicians to whose at-",

      "title": "The Psychiatric Examination of the Neurologic Patient",
      "abstract": "A well-conducted psychiatric evaluation is central to the care of neurologic patients with psychiatric disorders. The evaluation is aimed at defining the psychiatric condition in the context of the patient’s past psychiatric history and current neurologic disease. The information derived from the evaluation is used to develop a formulation, establish a diagnosis, and form a basis for treatment planning. This chapter discusses the psychiatric evaluation of the neurologic patient in detail. It includes examination techniques and questions as well as practical approaches to conducting an assessment of the patient’s cognitive state. Along the way, common psychiatric symptoms encountered in neurologic patients are defined and differentiated from related symptoms. The chapter concludes by illustrating how to generate a formulation and differential diagnosis. The psychiatric evaluation consists of three parts: the history; the mental status examination (MSE); and the formulation, including the differential diagnosis. The history, which is essential to defining the problem, is taken from the patient and from one or more informants. The importance of taking a history from an informant is underscored in the context of neurologic disease because patients may be forgetful, lack insight, or have language and other cognitive problems that may limit their ability to provide a good history. History-taking begins with defining the psychiatric chief complaint and then obtaining the family and personal history. Starting in this way, rather than with the chief complaint followed by the history of present illness (HPI), makes it easier to see that the psychiatric symptoms may have been caused by, or influenced by, factors other than the neurologic disease—factors that can include psychiatric disorders as such, aspects of patients’ personalities, and responses patients have to the circumstances of their lives. Table 1–1 provides an outline of important elements of the psychiatric history for neurologic patients and can be used as a checklist in clinical practice. Defining the psychiatric chief complaint is the physician’s first task. ‘‘Psychiatric chief complaint’’ in this context refers to the occurrence of cognitive, affective, behavioral, or perceptual phenomena that are brought to the physician’s attention by the patient, a family member or other informant, or by the physician’s own observation.",

      "title": "Cognitive assessment for clinicians",
      "abstract": "ymptoms in cognitive disorders follow location and not pathology.Thus, for example, in Alzheimer's disease, patients may present with a focal language syndrome, instead of the more commonly appreciated autobiographical memory disturbance, despite identical pathology.In contrast, large parts of the brain have limited eloquence, and may present in a similar fashion, despite notably different pathological processes.In our approach to the cognitive assessment, we maintain a symptom oriented approach.This in turn lends itself to localisation of pathology, and subsequently clinical diagnosis, which may be supplemented by associated neurological signs, imaging or other investigations.In its broadest sense, the purpose of the cognitive examination is to separate out those patients in whom a firm clinical diagnosis can be made, from those who require further and more detailed investigation.The history forms part of the examination, and the ability to respond to conversational cues is as much part of the examination as any formal assessment.In addition, the perspective of a reliable informant is essential, as memory disturbance and impaired insight are common.In any busy clinic, time is always an issue.Full cognitive assessment, including performance of various cognitive rating scales, generally takes an hour.Whatever the time available, a clear focus is needed early in the consultation.This directs attention to the relevant cognitive domains which need specific and more detailed examination. HISTORY c GeneralWe start by establishing a picture of pre-morbid functioning (for example, education, employment, significant relationships).Learning a little about the patient's interests or hobbies allows one to tailor questions in the cognitive examination more precisely.The onset, and time course of the deterioration, is as important as the cluster of deficits, be they memory, language, visual function, behaviour, or indeed psychiatric.Often, the first noted deficit has diagnostic relevance.We try to interview both the patient and informant independently, even when the amount of information likely to be obtained from the patient is minimal.Disparities between the two accounts are important as insight is often poor, and it allows a chance to assess both language and cooperation without interruption or assistance from the partner.A family history and risk factors, notably vascular, are particularly relevant, and should be specifically enquired about; considerable probing is often needed.The use of a questionnaire filled out before the consultation can save time, and draws attention to issues in the background history.Concomitant illness and medication use frequently underlie, or complicate, cognitive complaints.Alertness and cooperation with the assessment should be noted, as these factors may impact on the subsequent findings.The level of alertness is an important clue to the presence of a delirium or the effects of medication.Delirium may be marked by both restlessness and distractibility, or the patient may be quiet, and drift off to sleep easily during the consultation.If there is any concern about the level of alertness of the patient, review of the medication list is often helpful.It may be misleading, and is frequently hopeless, to perform a detailed cognitive assessment on a patient with diminished alertness.If that is the case, documentation of orientation and attention may be as much as can be achieved initially. MemoryComplaints about poor memory are the most frequent reason for referral to a cognitive disorders clinic, and provide a good starting point for the consultation despite not being very specific.A useful framework for analysing memory complaints divides memory into several separate domains.Episodic memory (personally experienced events) comprises anterograde (newly encountered information) or retrograde (past events) components, and depends on the hippocampal-diencephalic system.A second important system involves memory for word i22 www.",

Verhaltensauffälligkeiten, Dysautonomien, Schlafstörungen und sensorische Störungen beobachtet, die deutliche Implikationen auf die Lebensqualität haben können. Obwohl autonome Dysfunktionen wichtiger Bestandteil extrapyramidaler Erkrankungen (wie idiopathisches Parkinson-Syndrom, Multisystematrophie, progressive supranukleäre Blickparese, Lewy-Body-Demenz) sind, werden sie oft formal nicht mit untersucht und häufig nicht diagnostiziert. Eine geeignete symptomorientierte Diagnostik der unterschiedlichen Funktionssysteme des autonomen Nervensystems und eine symptomatische Therapie im Rahmen eines interdisziplinären Konzepts können von größtem Nutzen für die betroffenen Patienten sein. Leider sind doppelblinde, randomisierte, kontrollierte Studien selten, was zur Folge hat, dass die meisten Empfehlungen nicht evidenzbasiert sind. Im Folgenden sollen die wesentlichen pathophysiologischen Erkenntnisse neben der jeweiligen Diagnostik und Therapie dargestellt werden, wobei der Schwerpunkt auf den kardiovaskulären Funktionsstörungen liegt.",

      "abstract": "Functional disorders are clinical entities corresponding to complaints mimicking diseases without a clearly identified organic substrate despite a rigorous history and clinical examination. Sometimes, complementary examinations are necessary to rule out an organic lesion that could explain the symptomatology. The notion of a diagnosis of exclusion is therefore very present. The physician must constantly re-evaluate the diagnosis of functional disorder in order not to «miss» a diagnosis with an organic cause.The treatment of these functional disorders is sometimes based on psychological treatment when a psychogenic dimension seems to be involved. This is not always the case. In such cases it is necessary to be able to consider a placebo approach with the hope that the placebo effect may improve the patient's condition. This article discusses the placebo effect in functional disorders without omitting to address ethical and philosophical considerations.Les troubles fonctionnels sont des entités cliniques correspondant à des plaintes mimant des maladies sans substrat organique clairement identifié, malgré une anamnèse et un examen clinique rigoureux. Parfois, certains examens complémentaires sont nécessaires pour infirmer une lésion organique pouvant expliquer la symptomatologie. La notion de diagnostic d’exclusion est donc bien présente. Le praticien se doit de réévaluer sans cesse le diagnostic de trouble fonctionnel afin de ne pas «passer à côté» d’un diagnostic avec une cause organique. Le traitement de ces troubles fonctionnels repose parfois sur une prise en charge psychologique lorsqu’une dimension psychogène semble incriminée. Ce n’est pas toujours le cas. Il faut alors pouvoir être capable d’envisager une approche via des placebo en espérant que l’effet placebo puisse améliorer la condition du (de la) patient(e).

Metoda: Baza Medline została przeszukana w kierunku artykułów dotyczących niespecyficznych zaburzeń odżywiania się. Opisane zostały następujące zaburzenia: napady objadania się (BED); pica; zespół przeżuwania; unikanie / ograniczanie przyjmowania pokarmów; zespół jedzenia nocnego (NES); zaburzenia odżywiania się związane ze snem (SRED); bigoreksja; ortoreksja. Szczególny nacisk postawiono na diagnozowanie, objawy, współchorobowość, powikłania oraz leczenie. Wyniki: Wszystkie uwzględnione zaburzenia odżywiania się mogą mieć niebezpieczne konsekwencje, zarówno somatyczne, jak i psychiatryczne. Często również współwystępują z innymi zaburzeniami psychicznymi. Każde z wymienionych zaburzeń można zdiagnozować u kilku procent populacji ogólnej, od 0,5 – 4,7% (SRED) do ok. 7% (ortoreksja). W związku z rosnącą ilością danych z piśmiennictwa oraz zmianami w klasyfikacji DSM-5, klinicyści rozpoznają i leczą te zaburzenia coraz częściej.

Hence, we systematically investigated the frequency of reduced or increased bladder sensation in neurologic/mental diseases.We analyzed 911 patients who were referred from within our hospital. Data registries included a diagnosis, a lower urinary tract symptom questionnaire, a urodynamic study, and neurological examinations. Reduced bladder sensation is defined as bladder volume at the first sensation >300 ml. Increased bladder sensation is defined as bladder volume at the first sensation <100 ml. These patients were stratified into those with and without DO.Neuropathies are the most common cause of reduced bladder sensation (33.3-43.8% in diabetic neuropathy, etc.). Myelopathies are the second most common cause (17.4-25.0% in multiple sclerosis, etc.). Less common is brain diseases (9.6% in multiple system atrophy, etc.). In contrast, myelopathies are the most common cause of increased bladder sensation without DO (25.0-40.0% in spinal forms of systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, etc.). Neuropathies are the second most common (17.3-22.2% in post-pelvic organ surgery, diabetic neuropathy, etc.). Less common is brain/mental diseases (20.0% in psychogenic bladder dysfunction, 8.1% in Parkinson's disease, etc.).The present study revealed that neuropathies are the most common cause of reduced bladder sensation in neurologic/mental diseases. Increased bladder sensation without DO occurs mainly in peripheral and central sensory pathway lesions, as well as in basal ganglia lesions and psychogenic bladder dysfunction. Reduced and increased bladder sensation should be a major treatment target for maximizing patients' quality of life.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Aspects of Brain Injury in Childhood: A Review",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Children suffering with brain injury or epilepsy run an appreciably increased risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. The reasons for this are not clear, however. There have been few relevant follow‐up or treatment studies and it is still not known whether the associated presence of brain injury or epilepsy influences the natural history or treatability of a given type of psychiatric disorder. Abnormalities of gestational length, complications of delivery or infection of the nervous system do not appear to increase the risk of psychiatric disorder unless followed by manifest signs of brain injury. Children with structural damage and fits, and children with temporal lobe epilepsy seem to be those who are most likely to develop a behaviour disturbance. Brain‐damaged children may suffer from any type of psychiatric condition. There is no particular disorder that occurs with disproportionate frequency in the neuro‐epileptic population, and by implication there do not seem to be any specific behavioural syndromes which are themselves pathognomonic of central nervous system damage or dysfunction. RÉSUMÉ Aspects psychiatriques des lésions cérébrales dans l'enfance Les enfants souffrant d'une lésion cérébrale ou d'une épilepsie ont un risque nettement accru de présenter un trouble psychiatrique. Les raisons n'en sont cependant pas très claires. Peu d'études longitudinales ou thérapeutiques ont été entreprises et il n'est toujours pas établi que la présence associée d'un traumatisme cérébral ou d'une épilepsie marque l'histoire naturelle ou la curabilité d'un type donné de trouble psychiatrique. Les anomalies du temps de gestation, les complications de l'accouchement ou les infections du système nerveux ne semblent pas accroitre le risque de troubles psychiatriques s'il n'y a pas eu de signes manifestes de lésion cérébrale. Les enfants présentant des troubles structurés ou des crises et les enfants avec épilepsie du lobe temporal sont ceux qui ont le plus de chances de développer un trouble du comportement. Une lésion cérébrale chez l'enfant peut évoluer vers n'importe quel type de condition psychiatrique. II n'y a pas de désordres particuliers survenant avec une fréquence disproportionnée dans une population neuroépileptique; par voie de conséquences, il ne semble y avoir aucun syndrome comportemental spécifique qui soit pathognomonique d'un dommage ou d'une dysfonction du système nerveux central. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Psychiatrische Aspekte der Hirnverletzungen im Kindesalter Kinder, die an einer Hirnverletzung oder einer Epilepsie leiden, haben ein bedeutend höheres Risiko eine psychische Störung zu entwickeln. Die Gründe dafür sind jedoch nicht ganz klar. Es sind nur wenig relevante Langzeit‐ oder Behandlungsstudien gemacht worden und es ist noch nicht bekannt, ob eine Hirnverletzung oder Epilepsie den normalen Verlauf einer bestimmten psychischen Erkrankung, oder die Ansprechbarkeit auf die Therapie beeinflussen. Abnorme Gestationsperioden, Komplikationen bei der Geburt oder Infektionen des Nervensystems scheinen das Risiko für die Entstehung einer psychischen Erkrankung nicht zu erhöhen, es sei denn es treten danach deutliche Zeichen eines Hirnschadens auf. Kinder mit Fehlbildungen, Krämpfen und Temporallappenepilepsie entwickeln offenbar am ehesten Verhaltensstörungen. Hirngeschädigte Kinder können jegliche Art eines psychiatrischen Zustandbildes bieten. Es gibt keine spezielle Erkrankung, die mit übermäßiger Häufigkeit bei dem neuro‐epilepti‐schen Krankengut vorkommt und damit scheint es keine spezifischen Verhaltenssyndrome zu geben, die selbst pathognomonisch für eine Schädigung oder Dysfunktion des Zentralnervensystems sind. RESUMEN Aspectos psiquiàtricos de la lesión cerebral en la infancia Los niños que sufren de lesión cerebral o de epilepsia corren un riesgo apreciablemente aumentado de padecer una alteración psiquiátrica. Sin embargo las razones de ello no están claras. Se han realizado pocos estudios seriados o estudios de tratamiento y todavía no se sabe si la presencia asociada de una lesión cerebral o de epilepsia influencia la evolución o la posibilidad de tratamiento de un determinado tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. Las anomalías en la duración gestacional, complicaciones del parto o infección del sistema nervioso, no parece que aumenten el riesgo de una alteración psiquiátrica, salvo que vayan seguidos de signos manifiestos de lesión cerebral. Los niños con alteración estructural y convulsiones y niños con epilepsia del lóbulo temporal parece que son los que tienen más tendencia a desarrollar una alteración en el comportamiento. Los niños con lesión cerebral pueden sufrir cualquier tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. No hay ninguna alteración en particular que aparezca en la población neuro‐epiléptica con una frecuencia desproporcionada y por implicación no parece que haya ningún síndrome especifico del comportamiento que sea por sí mismo patogmónico de una lesión o disfunción del sistema nervioso central.",

Outcome can be quantified by means of specific, narrowly-defined measures, which may fail to reflect other serious sequelae, or by means of functional rating scales, which bear little logical relation to CHI pathophysiology and lump together patients with diverse deficits. The choice of appropriate intake measures of CHI severity in turn depends on which aspects of outcome are to be determined. As the cardinal symptom of CHI is altered consciousness, logical intake measures of CHI severity include measures of the depth and the duration of the abnormal state of consciousness. Confounding factors in outcome prediction include secondary complications of CHI, premorbid characteristics, and effects of acute and rehabilitative therapy. Most research has focused on functional outcome predictions based on simple intake measures obtained shortly after injury, but intake measures that permit accurate prediction of rehabilitation potential or of specific cognitive and behavioral outcomes are also needed.",

      "abstract": "Background and Summary: Traditionally, functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), including functional dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are defined by more or less specific symptoms and the absence of structural or biochemical abnormalities that cause these symptoms. This concept is now considered to be outdated; if appropriate tests are applied, structural or biochemical abnormalities that explain or cause the symptoms may be found in many patients. Another feature of FGID are the highly prevalent psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety. It is implied that mood disorders \"cause\" gastrointestinal symptoms. In fact, epidemiological data now provide strong evidence that in subsets of cases, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms arise first and mood disorders occur later, while in other patients the reverse appears to happen. Possible mechanisms for gut-brain dysfunction have been identified, with systemic minimal inflammation as a causal factor in at least some subjects. Other mechanisms that play a role in FGID include chronic infections, intestinal microbiota, low-grade mucosal inflammation including the increase of eosinophils, systemic immune activation, altered intestinal permeability, in diarrhea predominant IBS altered bile salt metabolism, abnormalities in the serotonin metabolism and genetic factors. All these factors might be modulated by environmental factors such as diet. Key Messages: While a number of factors can be linked to specific symptoms (e.g., pain or diarrhea), it is evident that the symptom-based categorization of patients will not allow targeted treatments that specifically address the underlying pathophysiology.",

Depression is known to be associated with increased levels of cognitive decline, but there is also growing evidence that psychological wellbeing is predictive of better general health. It has been shown, for instance, that stroke is less common in those with a positive sense of wellbeing. Optimistic older people have also been found to have lower rates of both mortality and institutionalisation over a ten-year period. This may be because of reduced levels of stress. There is evidence to suggest that positive mood influences cognitive performance over short periods and it is also possible that high levels of psychological wellbeing are beneficial for cognitive function over longer time periods.",

      "title": "Potential Mechanisms in Chemical Intolerance and Related Conditions",
      "abstract": "A bstract : The symptom of chemical intolerance may occur in isolation, but often occurs in conjunction with other chronic symptoms such as pain, fatigue, memory disturbances, etc. This frequent clustering of symptoms in individuals has led to the definition of several chronic multisymptom syndromes, such as multiple chemical sensitivity, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and Gulf War illnesses. The aggregate research into these syndromes has suggested some unifying mechanisms that contribute to symptomatology. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that there is aberrant function of numerous efferent neural pathways, such as the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic‐pituitary axes, in subsets of individuals with these conditions. There is perhaps the greatest evidence for abnormal sensory processing in these syndromes, with a low “unpleasantness threshold” for multiple types of sensory stimuli. Psychological and behavioral factors are known to play a significant role in initiating or perpetuating symptoms in some persons with these illnesses. In the field of pain research, the interrelationship between physiologic and psychologic factors in symptom expression has been well studied. Using both established and novel methodologies, studies have suggested that psychologic factors such as hypervigilance and expectancy are playing a relatively minor role in most individuals with fibromyalgia and that clear evidence exists of physiologic amplification of sensory stimuli. These studies need to be extended to more sensory tasks and to larger numbers of subjects with related conditions. It is of note, though, that existing data on this spectrum of illnesses would suggest that there may be greater psychologic contributions to symptomatology if an illness is defined in part by behavior (e.g., avoidance of chemical exposures) rather than on the basis of symptoms alone.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathological study of the group of presenile dementias, whether apparendy primarily a degeneration of cortical neurones or secondary to vascular, inflammatory or other disease, has for obvious reasons centered on the brain. However, it is possible that the degenerative process may in certain types also affect the peripheral nervous system. If this were so it would be valuable to recognize it not only from the pathological point of view but also, since peripheral nerves are more easily investigated during life, for differential diagnosis which is often difficult and sometimes impossible on clinical findings alone. While involvement of the lower motor neurone is unlikely to be present without causing physical signs impairment of sensation due to involvement of the primary sensory neurone may be overlooked, more especially because sensory testing is often not possible in demented patients.",

Axel Wollmer, Chefarzt der Klinik für Gerontopsychiatrie an der Asklepios Klinik Nord – Ochsenzoll Hamburg. Bis zu 20 % der über 65-Jährigen leiden an einer depressiven Störung und etwa 6 % davon erfüllen die diagnostischen Kriterien einer depressiven Episode. Häufig stehen jedoch bei dieser Klientel andere Erkrankungen im Vordergrund und die Beschwerden werden als körperliche Erkrankungen oder \"normale\" Alterserscheinung (Agism) fehlinterpretiert. Erschwerend kommt dazu, dass Depressionen im Alter oft atypisch bzw. subsyndromal verlaufen, d. h. die depressiven Syndrome erfüllen nicht alle Kriterien einer Depression nach den internationalen Klassifikationssystemen. So kann das Gefühl von Traurigkeit oder gedrückter Stimmung fehlen und stattdessen Schmerzen, Gedächtnisstörungen, Wahn, Reizbarkeit, Agitiertheit oder Schlafstörungen dominieren. Insbesondere bei männlichen älteren Patienten sind Schlafstörungen und Wutausbrüche Indikatoren für eine Depression, die nicht auf die leichte Schulter genommen werden sollten, mahnte Wollmer. Das zeigt auch die hohe Suizidrate Älterer, die ab dem 65. Lebensjahr drastisch ansteigt.",

Bei dieser sehr haufigen Diagnose in der Gastroenterologie ist das Zusammenwirken somatischer, psychischer und sozialer Komponenten bei der Entstehung und im Verlauf des Beschwerdebildes besonders zu beachten. Typisch fur das RDS sind abdominelle Beschwerden, Stuhlunregelmasigkeiten, sowie das Fehlen von organpathologischen Befunden, die die Beschwerden ausreichend erklaren konnten. Viele Betroffene suchen wiederholt Hilfe bei gastroenterologischen Spezialisten oder Institutionen. Da dieses Beschwerdebild sehr beeintrachtigend und fur einen Teil der Betroffenen auch sehr beangstigend ist, weisen diese auch haufiger (in Spezialzentren uber 60 %) psychische Storungen auf. Der Anteil von PatientInnen mit irgendeiner Form von psychischer Stressbelastung oder Traumatisierung (psychisch, physisch oder sexuell) in der Anamnese ist groser als bei anderen „organischen“ Erkrankungen. Wenn die Beschwerden nicht ausreichend erklart und behandelt werden, fuhrt dies haufig zur Erhohung des Leidensdrucks und zu einer weiteren „Hilfesuche“ bei den Betroffenen. Dies hat auch gesundheitsokonomische Konsequenzen mit Kostensteigerungen. Die Integration psychosozialer Faktoren im diagnostischen Prozess und eine psychosomatische Betreuung der RDS-PatientInnen sind daher besonders wichtig. Stichworter: Reizdarmsyndrom, viszerale Hypersensitivitat, Psychosomatik, Hirn-Darm-Achse, bauchgerichtete Hypnosetherapie. The Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is part of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), which were studied intensively within the last decades. In this very frequent diagnosis in Gastroenterology the interaction of somatic, psychic and social components in aetiology and the course of the illness should be especially considered. Typical symptoms in IBS are abdominal complaints, irregular bowel movements and lack of pathological findings, which could explain sufficiently the symptoms. Many patients seek repeatedly help from gastroenterological specialists and institutions. Since the illness is very impairing, and for some also terrifying, these patients show more frequent psychological disturbances (in tertiary centres more than 60 %). The proportion of patients with any kind of stress or abuse (psychological, physical or sexual) in their history is greater in IBS than in other “organic” diseases. If the symptoms are not sufficiently explained and / or treated, the suffering and health care seeking of IBS patients leads to health-economic consequences with increasing costs. Therefore the integration of psychosocial factors in the diagnostic process and the psychosomatic care of patients with IBS are very important.",

      "abstract": "Il ritardo mentale è una condizione caratterizzata da una funzione intellettuale globale significativamente al di sotto della media associata ad anomalie del comportamento adattivo, riscontrate durante l'epoca dello sviluppo. Esso può essere isolato o associato a diversi processi patologici del sistema nervoso centrale e può riconoscere cause geneticamente trasmesse o acquisite, anche in epoca gestazionale o perinatale. Scopo del lavoro è stato quello di verificare la presenza o meno di una correlazione tra grado di ritardo mentale stabilito clinicamente e quadri riscontrabili con RM a livello encefalico. Clinicamente i bambini sono stati suddivisi in quattro gruppi in base all'entità del ritardo mentale e alla presenza o meno e al tipo di segni neurologici associati. Da tale inquadramento emerge che il ritardo mentale lieve é stato riscontrato in percentuale lievemente più bassa rispetto alla forma severa, mentre sia nella forma lieve che in quella grave i casi con segni neurologici erano circa doppi rispetto alle forme isolate. Dalla valutazione delle immagini di RM emerge che il riscontro radiologico è positivo in un'elevatissima percentuale di casi (81,4%). Il reperto RM più frequente è rappresentato da alterazioni del segnale della mielina, seguite da quadri di atrofia e dalle malformazioni congenite. La connessione eziologica tra il ritardo riscontrato clinicamente e i reperti RM non è sicura, ma possono essere presi in considerazione un rallentamento della conduzione nervosa nelle leucoencefalopatie, un grado insufficiente di specializzazione di parti o di tutta la corteccia o un disturbo delle connessioni interneuroniche tra i due emisferi nelle malformazioni e un arresto del normale sviluppo dell'encefalo in epoca prenatale nelle atrofie. La RM dell'encefalo può fornire utili indicazioni per l'iter diagnostico e terapeutico successivo (mappe cromosomiche, indagini biochimiche, riabilitazione psicomotoria), proponendosi pertanto come indagine da eseguire in prima istanza nei pazienti con ritardo mentale ad impronta evolutiva.",

      "abstract": "Common causes of memory loss in older people are mild cognitive impairment, the various types of dementia, and psychiatric illness, mainly depression. Around 10% of patients with mild cognitive impairment progress to dementia each year. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of cases. Other common types of dementia are vascular, fronto-temporal, Lewy body, Parkinson's, and mixed type dementia. There is evidence to suggest that dementia pathology is established before the onset of symptoms, and thus mild cognitive impairment can be considered as a predementia stage. NICE guidance suggests examination of: attention, concentration, short- and long-term memory, praxis, language and executive function. Particular attention should be paid to any signs of neglect, state of dress, agitation or poor attention. Dysphasia and difficulty in naming objects is often present. Mood symptoms (including suicidal ideation) may be primary or comorbid. Abnormal thoughts and perceptions should be probed for, as psychotic symptoms are common. Primary care options for cognitive testing include the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition or the Abbreviated Mental Test Score. Physical examination should include observation of gait, inspection for tremor; examination for rigidity, bradykinesia, frontal release signs, upper motor neurone lesions, pulse and BP. Structural brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy, exclude other pathologies and act as a prognostic marker of dementia progression but the overlap in structural changes between the dementias makes imaging alone insufficient for diagnostic purposes. NICE guidelines recommend referral to a memory clinic for patients with mild cognitive impairment, those at high risk of dementia, such as patients with learning disabilities, Parkinson's disease, or patients who have had several strokes.",

In addition, psychological factors, the side effects of medications and physical symptoms such as fatigue, muscular weakness, pain and concerns about bladder and bowel incontinence may also be involved.

We present the case of a 17-year-old female requiring psychiatric hospitalization for obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder with mixed affective features, who was subsequently diagnosed with primary Sjogren's syndrome. Treatment with potent immunosuppression resulted in remission of psychiatric illness. Due to a lack of awareness and/or the lack of specific biomarkers, clinicians may not associate psychiatric symptoms with autoimmune disease, including primary Sjogren's syndrome. This case demonstrates that Sjogren's syndrome may be a causative or aggravating factor in mental disorders and that autoimmune diseases should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis of psychiatric illness especially in cases of concurrent physical symptomatology and severity or treatment resistance of psychiatric disease.",

The disturbances must be insidious in onset and progressive and must not be better accounted for by another psychiatric diagnosis, such as delirium, or systemic disease.",

      "title": "Funcionamiento neurocognitivo y psicosocial de pacientes con trastorno bipolar en una unidad de salud mental",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION: Existe evidencia de que los pacientes que padecen TB, e incluso sus familiares sanos, presentan patrones caracteristicos de afectacion de ciertos dominios neurocognitivos que persisten tras la remision clinica o periodo de eutimia. La perdida de funcionalidad psicosocial de estos pacientes se predice mejor con la presencia de alteraciones cognitivas que con variables clinicas o evolutivas. El clinico asistencial deberia conocer si existe afectacion o deterioro las funciones neurocognitivas de sus pacientes pero el medio asistencial cotidiano es dificil poder evaluar adecuadamente las funciones cognitivas y tampoco se acostumbra a cuantificar la funcionalidad psicosocial de los pacientes con TB. Las dificultades principales son la falta de entrenamiento de los profesionales y el elevado consumo de tiempo de las baterias neuropsicologicas. Por ello la mayoria de publicaciones a nivel mundial sobre este tema se han realizado centros asistenciales de tercer nivel o unidades superespecializadas, las cuales suelen estudiar pacientes con una mayor gravedad clinica. Es posible que, al menos parte de los conocimientos actuales sobre cognicion y funcionalidad del TB, no sean representativos o extrapolables al universo (o conjunto) de personas con esta enfermedad. Pretendemos esta investigacion estudiar una poblacion en el real, no afectada por sesgos que pueden derivarse de las muestras de las unidades superespecializadas o de los restrictivos ensayos clinicos. METODOLOGIA: El estudio pretende reclutar a todas las personas que padecen TB seguimiento psiquiatrico una Unidad de Salud Mental (USM) para evaluar el estado neurocognitivo y el funcionamiento psicosocial y cuantificar el consumo de recursos sanitarios durante el ano previo a la evaluacion. Las escalas elegidas por su brevedad y facil aplicabilidad para evaluar dichos funcionamientos son respectivamente el Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP-S) y la Escala Breve del Funcionamiento o Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST), sus versiones espanolas. El objetivo principal del estudio es caracterizar el funcionamiento neurocognitivo y psicosocial de la muestra y objetivos secundarios son el analisis de la relacion entre distintas variables clinicas, evolutivas, diagnosticas y de tratamiento con el funcionamiento cognitivo y psicosocial asi como su relacion con el consumo de recursos sanitarios y establecer que parte de la varianza del funcionamiento psicosocial se explica por el grado de afectacion cognitiva de los pacientes con TB. JUSTIFICACION DEL ESTUDIO: Ademas del interes que supone este estudio por realizarse una muestra que pretende representar el mundo real al cenirse a explorar a los pacientes que acuden al primer punto basico de atencion psiquiatrica un Departamento de Salud como son las USM, se anade la innovacion de correlacionar el estado cognitivo y funcional con el uso de recursos sanitarios, aspecto aun no reflejado la literatura. RESULTADOS: El estudio corrobora hallazgos previos la relacion de ciertas variables clinicas con la afectacion cognitiva y funcional, sobre todo con la presencia de sintomas subsindromicos depresivos. Difiere la severidad de la afectacion cognitiva y funcional. No hay relacion del consumo de recursos sanitarios el ano previo con la afectacion cognitiva pero si la hay con la funcional. El modelo de regresion lineal y logistica para predecir la varianza de la afectacion funcional confirma la hipotesis inicial de que la afectacion cognitiva la predice junto con otras variables clinicas y terapeuticas. DISCUSION Y CONCLUSIONES: Nuestra muestra presenta diferencias sus caracteristicas demograficas y clinicas respecto de otras muestras estudiadas y esto parece relacionado con los resultados de afectacion cognitiva, funcional y de consumo de recursos sanitarios. Se discuten las implicaciones de estos resultados y la importancia de aplicar una evaluacion neurocognitiva y funcional la practica clinica habitual de una USM.",

      "abstract": "Emotions of any kind and experienced at any age are etiologic factors of neuroses only in predisposed persons. Predisposed persons are those of neuropathic and psychoneuropathic constitution. This is characterized by excessive excitability and abnormal reactivity of the nervous system. This involves, in various degree and proportion, the autonomic nervous system as well as the higher cerebral functions including associative and emotional mental reactions. Objective signs of autonomic nervous imbalance can be detected by physical examination. In the mental sphere, psychoneurotic constitution can be recognized by emotional imbalance, excessive, inadequate, untimely reactions (\"psychic dysmetry\").Neuropathic and psychoneuropathic constitution per se is compatible with perfect health. It deserves attention, however, in that its carriers may play an important role in cultural and social life and so exert a great suggestive influence on the mass of people. The type of neurosis or psychoneurosis and the symptoms of it depend chiefly on the constitutional morbid predisposition (constitutional biologic inferiority) of certain organs or organ systems and on the kind of emotional situations which the patient is unable to cope with. The great number of neuroses, psychoneuroses and psychosomatic diseases among patients consulting them makes it imperative that internists and general practitioners be capable of making the correct diagnosis and of carrying out the indicated treatments by \"minor psychotherapy.\"",

      "title": "Diagnostic approach for studying epileptic seizure",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures that are caused by abnormal and excessive cerebral neuronal discharges. The clinical symptoms are paroxysmal, and may include impaired consciousness and/or motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic events. Diagnosis of epilepsy is not always straightforward and clear-cut. A seizure is only a symptom that indicates neuronal dysfunction. Other diseases can cause paroxysmal events, which look very much like a seizure but in fact are nonepileptic. Such nonepileptic events include syncope, acute symptomatic seizures, and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. To identify epileptic seizures and to classify the type of epilepsy, clinical, electroencephalographic (EEG), and/or neuroimaging findings are the fundamentals. Knowledge of the different types of seizures is essential to guide the physician in obtaining the history which leads to the diagnosis of seizure and epilepsy. In real situations, however, it is rare for physicians to actually witness the event of seizure. This lecture provides valuable opportunity to experience \"real life\" clinical diagnosis of epileptic seizures by showing the video of patient under seizure and EEG data. Representative visual examples of symptoms together with the detailed medical knowledge will greatly enhance the capability of diagnosis, the effectiveness of treatment, and help develop clinical strategies.",

Quite often one might see a vertical down beat nystagmus in the head hanging position of Stenger's maneuver. iii) Saccadic or ataxic ocular pursuit in the eye tracking test, iv) Abnormal findings of the optokinetic after nystagums test, which could suggest some disorder in the central nervous system, usually decreased optokinetic after nystagmus v) Abnormal x-ray findings in the cervical spine, e.g. cervical spondylosis.Diseases which could cause vertigo or dizziness other then V.B.I. should be ruled out.A partient with abnormalities of all five items has definite V.B.I., one with four or three abnormal items has probable V.B.I., and one with two items has possible V.B.I., To establish these criteria of V.B.I., we analyzed 250 partients with vertigo experienced during the past three years. Peripheral vertigo was pressent in 39% and central vertigo in 23%. V.B.I. was diagnosed in 20% of the 250 patients.Our recent experience with 77 patients with V.B I. was also analyzed statistically.",

      "abstract": "Mind and body are inseparable entities and influences each other until death. Many factors such as stress, anxiety, depression, negative thoughts, unhealthy life style, unwholesome diet etc., disturb mental and physical wellbeing. Senile dementia is the mental deterioration, i.e, loss of intellectual ability associated with old age. It causes progressive deterioration of mental faculties, e.g., memory, intellect, attention, thinking, comprehension and personality, with preservation of normal level of consciousness. Two major types of senile dementia have been identified, namely that due to generalized atrophy in the cortical area of the brain (Alzheimer's type) and that due to vascular disorders mainly due to stroke. According to DSM-IV (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders), the essential feature of dementia is the development of multiple cognitive deficits that include memory impairment and at least one of the following cognitive disturbances such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or a disturbance in executive function. For the present study, a standardized questionnaire in the form of proforma incorporating types of foods (madhura, amla and lavana rasayukta ahara etc.) and life style (divaswapna, ratrijagarana and manasika bhavas etc) is prepared. To assess manasika bhava, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale, and standardized gradations of anumana pariksha of manasika bhavas mentioned by Charaka at Vimana Sthana 4/8 were adopted. In this study, most of the patients had disturbed sleep, tendency to indulge in defective dietary habits and kapha vitiating diets and life style. On Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, patients had anxiety, tension, depression, difficulty in concentration, and memory. On Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, these patients had anxiety, depression, and hypochondriasis. On Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale, psychological factors affected include: anxiety, depression, somatic concern and tension, etc. The data reflects that unwholesome diet and disturbed mental health plays an important role in etiopathogenesis of senile dementia.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Der nicht-konvulsive Status epilepticus (NKSE) ist gekennzeichnet durch andauernde elektroklinische epileptische Aktivität oder durch eine Abfolge von epileptischen Anfällen, zwischen denen der Patient nicht zum Vorzustand zurückkehrt, und die ohne eindeutige tonische-klonische Entäußerungen einhergehen. Diese „stille“ Manifestation andauernder klinisch-neurologischer Symptome wie Aphasie, Verwirrung, etc. erschwert das Erkennen eines NKSE; oft ist der wichtigste Diagnoseschritt, überhaupt daran zu denken, dass die vorliegende Klinik auf einem NKSE beruhen könnte. Sicher nachgewiesen und bestätigt werden kann der NKSE nur durch eine unmittelbare EEG-Ableitung. In epidemiologischen Studien scheint der konvulsive Status epilepticus (KSE) häufiger (60 : 40 %) vorzukommen, doch dies ist fraglich, werden doch viele NKSE aufgrund der unspektakulären Manifestation verpasst. Pathophysiologisch spielen sich auf neuronaler Ebene dieselben Phänomene wie beim KSE ab, einfach nur nicht in den primären Motoneuronen. Die permanente Hyperexzitabilität kann die vom NKSE betroffenen Neuronen genauso schädigen. Hingegen fehlen die unmittelbar vital bedrohlichen sekundären pathophysiologischen Folgen des KSE (Lactat-Azidose, respiratorische Erschöpfung, Rhabdomyolyse, etc.) beim NKSE weitgehend. Doch auch dort können autonome Phänomene (Arrhythmien [Kammertachykardie oder Asystolie] und Atmungsprobleme) den Patienten akut lebensgefährlich gefährden. Die Ursachen für einen NKSE sind vielfältig und umfassen bei Patienten mit einer bekannten Epilepsie v. a. Medikationsprobleme (mangelnde Adhärenz, Interaktionen bei Zugabe anderer Medikamente); bei ihnen sowie denjenigen Betroffenen ohne bekannte Epilepsie kommen metabolische, toxische, strukturelle (Tumore, Blutungen, Ischämien), infektiöse, entzündliche und autoimmune Ursachen in Frage. Entsprechend breit sollte die Ursache für einen NKSE abgeklärt werden, da besonders bei den akuten symptomatischen Formen die Behandlung der Ursache mindestens so wichtig ist wie die anfallsbeendende Behandlung des NKSE.",

      "title": "39 Lysosomal Storage Diseases",
      "abstract": "Many inborn errors of metabolism manifest with clinical evidence of a storage disease in the central nervous system (CNS) and/or peripheral organs. Since this storage occurs within the lysosomes, these inborn errors of metabolism areknownaslysosomalstoragediseases.Inmosttypes,the clinical presentation usually is similar, and there are only a few clinical hints that guide the pediatrician to the correct diagnosis. For example, only an experienced clinician can differentiate Hurler syndrome from Maroteaux– Lamy syndrome at the bedside early in infancy. The diagnostic efforts are further complicated by the fact that the phenotypic expression of the disease varies according to its age of onset. For example, while GM2 gangliosidosis, either Sandhoff or Tay–Sachs variety, manifests first in early infancy with a severe dementing disease, the same disorder with a lesser degree of enzyme deficiency will manifest in late childhood or early adolescence with motor clumsiness or ataxia. As the name implies, lysosomal storage diseases are usually associated with the enlargement of visceral organs. However, visceromegaly is also observed in other storage diseases that do not involve lysosomes. For example, glycogen storage disease (GSD) types 1, 3, and 4 cause significant hepatomegaly with or without splenomegaly and can easily be confused clinically with a lysosomal storage disease. The GSDs usually, but not always, lead to significant impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism, which are not seen in lysosomal storage diseases, and may be diagnosed through simple clinical laboratory tests. Some types of GSD, such as GSD type 3, cause early hepatosplenomegaly but no significant hypoglycemia or lactic acidosis. At early stages of the disease, it is nearly impossible to differentiate clinically GSD type 3 from Niemann–Pick disease type B, except that biochemical studies are helpful (e.g., GSD type 3, in contrast to Niemann–Pick disease, causes elevated creatine kinase [CK]). Acommon misconception is that all lysosomal storage diseases cause clinically visible organomegaly or skeletal changes. A large group of them affect primarily the CNS, with little or no involvement of the peripheral organs. For example, Krabbe disease is associated with the storage of galactocerebrosides in the CNS, with no visceromegaly. Unless the pediatrician is aware that some storage diseases primarily affect the CNS, appropriate laboratory tests might not be ordered to reach the diagnosis. This chapter is intended to provide a bedside guideline to the pediatrician for the diagnosis of lysosomal storage diseases. This is important since experimental therapies are available, such as enzyme replacement therapy. However, such therapeutic attempts require early diagnosis; for example, a bone marrow transplant (BMT) is rewarding only if the diagnosis is reached early. Newly available in utero BMTas well as the recent availability of gene therapy (e.g., for Hurler syndrome) make mandatory an accurate diagnosis of the disease in the index case, in order to provide intervention in future siblings or fetuses. The list of lysosomal storage diseases that are reviewed in this chapter is presented in >Table 39.1.",

      "abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disabling neuroinflammatory disease. Psychiatric manifestations have a high prevalence in MS patients and may worsen the illness progression and the patients' quality of life (QoL). Depression is a highly prevalent condition in MS patients, associated with poorer adherence to treatment, decreased functional status and QoL, and increased suicide risk. Diagnosis and treatment of this disorder is challenging because of symptom overlap. Other prevalent psychiatric comorbidities are anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, substance misuse and personality disorders. As the illness progresses, personality changes can happen, as well as affect abnormalities. Cognitive changes occur frequently in MS patients, and affect features like processing speed, attention, learning, memory, visual spatial capabilities, and some language deficits. Disease-modifying treatments may reduce cognitive impairment because of their container action on the brain's lesion burden. Other QoL determinants such as fatigue, pain, sexual dysfunction, exercise, resilience and social support should be taken into account, in order to promote the individuals' well-being. Further studies are needed in order to elucidate the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and more neuroimaging studies are required to clarify the relationship between structural changes and psychiatric comorbidities.",

      "title": "P3‐174: Mild cognitive impairment: A new hope",
      "abstract": "Various studies have suggested that Alzeimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic process that begins well before clinical expression of dementia. Moreover, works showed that weak cognitive performances can precede by a few years the diagnosis of AD. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) describes a state of abnormal cognitive functioning that is insufficient to warrant a diagnosis of dementia. The concept of MCI nominates old persons afflicted with light cognitive disorders which could present certain signs of AD several years before this one is not diagnosed. MCI does not significantly impact basic daily activities and is not accompanied by declines in overall cognitive function. People with MCI are three to four times more likely to develop Alzheimer's than those without such impairment. Amnestic MCI (significantly affects memory) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease, while nonamnestic MCI may progress to other types of syndromes (such as frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia or dementia with Lewy bodies). But some people with MCI don't go on to develop any type of dementia. Some remain stable, while others even revert to normal.The conversion rate from MCI to AD is 12% per year. After a brief presentation of the concept of MCI, this communication will emphasize on different subjects like cognitive area. This deficits will be link with neuroimmaging that demonstrate atrophic hippocampal formations, atrophic enthorinal cortices, greater total brain atrophy, enlarge ventricles. We demonstrated deficits in : – memory: episodic memory, visuopsatial and spatial short terme memory -executive function: flexibility and planification -attention : focus attention, visual search, ability to desengaged attention and to use visual cue to produce an alerting effect. MCI is a concept based on criteria of Petersen. This criteria help us to know if MCI is a transition state between cognitive decline on normal aging and clinical presentation of dementia. More over, this cognitive deficits help us to make the link between cognitive area and activity of daily living. MCI is a new hope for our generation and the prevention of dementia.",

      "title": "Mild Cognitive Impairment as the Initial Manifestation of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a major form atypical parkinsonism that should be differentiated from Parkinson's disease. Individuals with PSP typically present with an akinetic rigid syndrome with early postural instability, axial rigidity, and supranuclear gaze palsy.1, 2 Cognitive disorder in PSP is milder than Alzheimer's disease,3 featuring frontal executive dysfunction,4, 5 and appears with motor signs.1, 2 In contrast, it is rare that cognitive disorder occurs without motor disorder in PSP.2, 3 Such a patient was recently seen. A 73-year-old, previously healthy woman began to have memory problems (e.g., forgetful, forgetting to turn lights off, forgetting neighbors’ names) and infrequent delusional episodes (e.g., thinking that someone had stolen her wallet) for which she saw a general physician, who referred her to a memory clinic. She was taking no drugs that might affect cognitive or motor function. She was alert but slightly nervous and irritable. Her speech was fluent, and cranial nerve examinations, including extraocular muscle movement and eyelids, produced normal results. Her posture, including her neck, was normal. She had no tremor, rigidity, or akinesia of the neck, hands, or feet. Her gait was slightly slow for her age. Sensory examinations were unremarkable. She scored 20 out of 30 (normal > 24) on the Mini-Mental state Examination (MMSE) and 8 out of 18 (normal > 16) on the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Laboratory data were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1A) and brain 99mTc- L,L-ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography showed no remarkable changes. Metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy results were normal (heart to mediastinum ratio on delayed images 3.35, normal > 2.0).6 Although hippocampal atrophy was not remarkable, she was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due possibly to Alzheimer's disease. She was referred back to the local clinic, where 5 mg/d donepezil hydrochloride was started. Two years later, she was referred to the memory clinic again because of slow, short-stepped gait with assistance that had begun 1 year before. On examination, her cognitive function had deteriorated: MMSE score 14, FAB score 5. Delusions were not significant. Cranial nerve examination showed supranuclear vertical gaze palsy and dysarthria. She had no retropulsion. She had rigidity in her neck and upper extremities and marked akinesia bilaterally. She had no signs of aphasia, apraxia, limb dystonia, or alien hands. Brain MRI showed atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum (humming-bird sign or emperor penguin sign)7 (Figure 1B), and she was diagnosed with PSP1, 2 and referred back to the local clinic with instructions that she needed 300 mg/d of levodopa/carbidopa for gait difficulty. At the first visit, she had MCI alone without motor disorder. At the second visit, 2 years later, she had vertical gaze palsy and axial rigidity and akinesia. She did not have classical corticobasal syndrome during the course of the disease. Repeated brain MRI revealed midbrain atrophy and neurological signs. No similar cases had been previously reported to the knowledge of the authors except for a schizophrenia-like case8 and two cases of behavioral changes.9, 10 At the first memory screening, The woman described herein had marked frontal executive dysfunction as assessed according to the FAB. Prominent frontal dysfunction is a feature of PSP but not of Alzheimer's disease.3 A pathological lesion might have started in the frontal cortex and caused her frontal executive dysfunction. In conclusion, an elderly woman with PSP who presented with MCI without motor disorder is reported. MCI can be listed as a premotor feature of PSP.

In some cases, the impairment is quite mild, detectable only by neuropsychological examination, and perhaps only in comparison with an identical twin. In other cases, the impairment is obvious and severe enough to warrant an additional diagnosis of dementia (Davidson et al., 1995). Unlike psychotic symptoms, cognitive deficits in schizophrenia do not remit spontaneously nor are they ameliorated by treatment with typical antipsychotic drugs (for a review, see Cassens et al., 1990).",

      "title": "The Strategy of Clinical Procedure for Determining Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "title": "Theoretical Perspectives on Mental Health and Illness: Introduction to Part I",
      "abstract": "Mental health and mental disorder represent two different areas of theory, research, and policy implications, reflecting our common tendency to dichotomize healthy and sick, normal and abnormal, sane and insane. David Mechanic (2006) argues that the term “mental health” has no clear or consistent meaning, and in terms of the sociological literature, this is generally true. Mental health is not merely the absence of disease or disorder; it involves self-esteem, mastery, and the ability to maintain meaningful relationships with others. While most of us fall short of optimal well-being (or happiness), those who experience mental health problems or psychological distress have been the focus of most sociological research. However, definitions of mental health problems, illnesses, or disorders are also not so straightforward. Following Horwitz (2002b), “mental diseases” reflect underlying internal dysfunctions that have universal features (i.e. schizophrenia and to a lesser degree bipolar disorder). A valid “mental disorder” reflects some internal psychological system that is unable to function as it should, and this dysfunction is socially inappropriate. For most disorders, symptoms are not specific indicators of discrete, underlying diseases (such as schizophrenia), instead many conditions arise from stressful social conditions (such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders). Cultural processes shape the symptoms associated with mental disorders, and it is important to distinguish mental disorders from normal reactions to social stressors. Horwitz (2002b) uses the terminology of “mental illness” to refer to those conditions which a particular group has defined as a mental illness (and often point to behaviors that are deemed deviant, for example homosexuality in previous psychiatric classifications). For simplicity, we will use the term mental health problem or disorder in this introduction – but students should keep in mind the implications of using the term mental illness. In Chapter 1, Horwitz argues that sociological approaches regard mental health and mental health problems as aspects of social circumstances. He provides a very thorough overview of how various social conditions affect levels of mental health and mental health problems, and in turn how social contexts shape the definition as well as the response to mental health problems. Chapter 1 develops a framework for a sociological understanding of mental disorder and mental health problems and also directs the reader to other chapters in the volume that illustrate Horwitz's arguments.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a complex phenomenon that continues to defy one unifying scientific explanation. Behavioral, psychological, environmental, physiologic, metabolic, and genetic explanations are just some of the possibilities identified as contributing to or causing obesity; yet, each explanation encounters controversy and no one explanation has gained unanimous consensus. Ideally, once a patient has had weight loss surgery (WLS), he or she loses excess weight in a controlled, healthy manner and complies with all the components of the recommended bariatric treatment program; sometimes, however, patients \"modify\" their post-surgical instructions. The ability to identify program modifications may be initially camouflaged if patients continue to lose weight and their laboratory values and other medical tests indicate that their weight loss status is smoothly progressing. On the surface it may seem that all is well, but appearances may be deceiving. A dysfunctional relationship with food and other substances of abuse, such as alcohol, may be lurking underneath the surface of what passes as treatment success, and this condition, left untreated, may persist or evolve to a cross-addiction, also known as an addiction transfer or a substitute addiction. A cross-addiction occurs when an individual exchanges one compulsive behavior for another compulsive behavior, such as when a weight loss surgery patient is no longer overeating or bingeing, but instead is abusing alcohol. An incisive and comprehensive nursing assessment that includes how, why, and in what manner the WLS patient is losing weight needs to be conducted to uncover established or developing cross-addictive behaviors. Clearly, assuming that any weight loss is better than no weight loss is a dangerous proposition when the mechanisms of how this weight loss occurred are not identified.",

The availability of eye-tracking techniques as well as a variety of neuroimaging technologies enabling researchers to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of brain activity, has challenged such dichotomies, suggesting that even when participants achieve “scores in the normal range”, this does not necessarily indicate intactness, because the behavioural scores can be shown to be underpinned by atypical neural processes. This holds for a wide range of cognitive domains (e.g., face processing, language, number, attention, inhibition, memory) and across a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Williams syndrome, Down syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Foetal Alcohol syndrome, Obstructive Sleep Apnea), as well as low/high SES.",

Moreover the neurobiology of somatoform pain disorder is still not entirely understood. However, insights from psychobiology shed new light on the genesis of pain disorders like genetic or epigenetic factors, traumatic experiences like childhood abuse or lack in the development of social feelings like empathy. Recent neuroimaging results suggest that especially the neural mechanisms of the affective dimension of pain are disturbed in patients with somatoform pain disorder, and underlying mechanisms may include processing of similar experiences (e.g., depression) in overlapping spatio-temporal patterns of neural activation. In this talk we will present recent biological data at least in part from our own neuroimaging research that could help to deepen our still preliminary understanding of the nature of this mental disorder.",

      "abstract": "Whiplash is a contentious issue in the medico-legal field; opposing views are held about persisting symptoms. The exact pathology is not known; but it is generally accepted to be ‘soft tissue injury’. The same clinical syndrome can occur without a road accident. No one doubts the reality of the condition in the early stages when the symptoms and signs (of a ‘mechanical derangement’) are clear cut. As with other soft tissue injuries, most ‘heal’ within a usual time span; some take longer to heal; and some have persisting problems giving rise to chronic pain, restricted movements &/or a feeling of ‘instability’. In this latter group the physical signs are less obvious but are still present, if sought. Imaging is rarely relevant. The psychological reaction to any injury or illness will vary from individual to individual (the previous personality); or from time to time in the same individual. People with chronic pain may become depressed and may develop ‘excessive’ psychological reactions – often referred to as ‘chronic pain syndrome’ and, by some, as ‘abnormal illness behaviour’; this is exacerbated when litigation is involved with its attendant adversarial, confrontational approach which questions the ‘genuineness’ of both the patient and their symptoms and disability. Where symptom persist beyond the ‘usual’ time for healing, and are consistent with the (albeit subtle) physical signs found, there can be no grounds for arguing that they are nor related to the accident.",

      "title": "Schizophrenie - Hirnentwicklungsstörung oder degenerativer Hirnprozess?",
      "abstract": "In den letzten 2 Jahrzehnten wird die Schizophrenie zunehmend als Hirnentwicklungsstörung (HES) angesehen. Hierfür werden u. a. prämorbide Persönlichkeitsstörungen und somatische Symptome, mit bildgebenden oder neurohistologischen Verfahren erhobene pathologische Hirnbefunde und fokale kortikale Dysplasien diskutiert. Argumente für die eine oder andere Hypothese werden diskutiert. Prämorbide Persönlichkeitsstruktur und Verhaltensauffälligkeiten müssen von den Vorläufersyndromen (Prodrome und Vorpostensyndrome [2] [3] [41] [56]), die der psychotischen Erstmanifestation viele Jahre vorangehen, unterschieden werden. Nur bei einem Teil der Patienten, die später an einer Schizophrenie erkranken, finden sich eine prämorbid abnorme Persönlichkeitsstruktur. Erklärungen, warum sich die Erkrankung, sollte es sich um eine HES handeln, erst im Erwachsenenalter oder in der Adoleszenz klinisch manifestiert, bleiben spekulativ. Als Hinweis für eine HES wird angeführt, dass die Ventrikelerweiterungen bereits bei Auftreten der positiven Symptomatik vorhanden seien und im weiteren Verlauf nicht fortschreiten. Sollte aber eine HES für die Erweiterung der Ventrikel verantwortlich sein, müssten, da Hirngewebe verlorengeht, bevor das Wachstum des Gehirns abgeschlossen ist, Schädelvolumen und Kopfgröße vermindert sein, was bei Schizophrenien nicht zutrifft [45]. Außerdem liegt der eigentliche Erkrankungsbeginn der Schizophrenie (mit Prodromen und Vorpostensyndromen) mehrere Jahre vor der psychotischen Erstmanifestation. Verlust oder Verringerung der zerebralen Asymmetrie, ein Cavum septi pellucidi oder eine Dysgenese des Corpus callosum, die für eine HES herangezogen werden, sind nur bei einer geringen Anzahl schizophrener Patienten zu beobachten und nicht häufiger als in der Durchschnittsbevölkerung [13]. Kontrovers diskutiert wird auch die Frage der Bedeutung von Geburtskomplikationen und viralen Infektionen [2] [19] [20]. Versuche, als Entwicklungsstörung aufgefasste Hirnbefunde mit klinischen Subgruppen zu korrelieren, waren nicht sehr erfolgreich; dies gilt auch für eine Subgruppe, die durch männliches Geschlecht, frühen Beginn und sporadisches Auftreten charakterisiert ist. Nur ein bestimmter psychopathologischer Remissionstyp mit der Komponente eines irreversiblen reinen Defektsyndroms kann mit einer bestimmten Hirnveränderung korreliert werden [2] [8] [12] [24] [25] [42] [52]. Die Bonner Schizophrenie-Langzeitstudie mit dem Ausgang in unterschiedliche Residualsyndrome ergab Hinweise, dass die Schizophrenie sicher kein neurodegenerativer Prozess im üblichen Sinne ist. 78 % der Patienten zeigen keine vollständige Remission; die Erkrankung verläuft nur 5 - 10 Jahre lang progredient; selbst chronische schizophrene Defektpsychosen können noch nach jahrzehntelangem Verlauf auf nichtpsychotische reine Defizienzsyndrome remittieren; andererseits kommt es in 15 % nach jahrelang remittierendem Verlauf noch zu einer Progredienz; schließlich besteht keine Korrelation zwischen Verlaufsdauer und Ausgang [2]. Schizophrenie ist keine kontinuierlich fortschreitende Erkrankung i. S. eines primären neurodegenerativen Prozesses ist, vielmehr eine in kurzen Zeiträumen fortschreitende und danach zu einem Stillstand kommende Störung [13] [45]. Die Auffassung der Schizophrenie als Entwicklungsstörung gilt nur für eine relativ kleine Teilgruppe. Es gibt Analogien zu bestimmten organischen Hirnerkrankungen, z. B. den „Vorzeitigen Versagenszuständen” von Beringer und Mallison [36] s. a. [37]. Die Deutung der Hirnbefunde bei einem Teil der Schizophrenien als „vorzeitige, lokal betonte Altersinvolution” (Raymond) erscheint plausibel.",

Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits).

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "Análisis no lineal de registros magnetoencefalográficos de pacientes con Trastorno Obsesivo Compulsivo mediante la complejidad de Lempel-Ziv",
      "abstract": "espanolEl trastorno obsesivo compulsivo (TOC) se caracteriza por la presencia de obsesiones y compulsiones que causan un malestar afectivo y una repercusion en distintas esferas de la vida del paciente clinicamente significativos. El procesado de senales biomedicas es una rama del conocimiento destinada al desarrollo de algoritmos especificos para los distintos tipos de senales y aplicaciones, que posibiliten el establecimiento de diagnosticos mas precisos. En el presente trabajo las senales que vamos a analizar se denominan magnetoencefalogramas, que son registros de los campos magneticos generados por la actividad neuronal del cerebro. La informacion de las senales biomedicas puede no ser percibida de forma inmediata, siendo necesario extraerla bien mediante procesos muy simples (mediante inspeccion visual) o muy complejos (mediante herramientas avanzadas de procesado de senal). El objetivo de los parametros de complejidad es estimar la predictibilidad, electroencefalografica o magnetoencefalografica, de las oscilaciones cerebrales y/o el numero de osciladores independientes que subyacen tras las senales observadas. La existencia de inconsistencias en los resultados de analisis no lineales ha llevado a la reflexion de que quizas ciertos metodos pueden ser mas adecuados para el estudio de determinadas senales biomedicas. En el caso concreto de los registros neurofisiologicos, la complejidad de Lempel-Ziv (LZC ) puede ser mas fiable que otras medidas. El objetivo fundamental de esta Tesis Doctoral es utilizar una herramienta de analisis no lineal, el algoritmo de Lempel Ziv para analizar la actividad magnetoencefalografica espontanea de pacientes con TOC y de controles sanos. Para ello se estudio una muestra de 13 sujetos atendidos en la Unidad de TOC del Hospital Ramon y Cajal, diagnosticados de Ludopatia segun los criterios DSM IV-TR. Se descarto la presencia de cualquier tipo de comorbilidad medica, neurologica o psiquiatrica que pudiera alterar los resultados. Por su parte, el grupo control estaba constituido por 60 sujetos sanos en los que igualmente se descarto la presencia de cualquier trastorno neurologico o psiquiatrico. Los resultados muestran una correlacion positiva entre la edad y los valores de LZC tanto en los controles como en los TOC. Los valores medios de complejidad en el grupo control eran mayores que en el de los TOC si bien el coeficiente de regresion entre la edad y complejidad en los TOC era superior al de los controles., mostrando un comportamiento desigual en ambas muestras. Se observo una asimetria en la correlacion entre la complejidad de ambos hemisferios en los TOC que no se objetivo en los controles. La region anterior mostro numerosas anormalidades que pueden relacionarse con hallazgos neurofisiologicos previos. Se concluye que los sujetos con TOC presentaron valores medios de complejidad de Lempel-Ziv menores que los controles sanos en todas las regiones estudiadas. El incremento de la complejidad con la edad es de mayor magnitud en los TOC que en los controles en todas las regiones cerebrales salvo en la region anterior. El comportamiento de la complejidad en la region anterior de los TOC difiere del observado en los controles, hecho que podria guardar relacion con la hiperactividad frontal descrita en numerosos trabajos anteriores. Existe una asimetria entre las regiones lateral derecha e izquierda en los TOC pero no en los controles. EnglishObsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions and compulsions that cause emotional distress and affect different aspects of a patient´s life which are clinically significant. The main feature of OCD is obsession, understanding as such any thought, feeling, idea or image, unusual and repetitive despite the efforts to ignore or confront them. The second and also essential element is compulsion: every repetitive and stereotyped action done to mitigate the anxiety that stems from obsessions. With the compulsion the subject obtains temporary relief, but it is not in itself pleasant and may cause more distress than the obsessions. OCD is classified within anxiety disorders in ICE10 and DSM-IV. This is due to: -the presence of obsessions, that cause anxiety and generate compulsions, with the objective of relieving anxiety. -Both in OCD and other anxiety disorders avoidance behaviour appear, aimed at preventing situations which cause anxiety. However, its classification is frequent cause of discussion between those who consider that its symptomatology, course, epidemiology and neurobiological findings differ considerably from the rest of anxiety disorders. An important group of investigators proposed the creation of an Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum, which would include OCD but also other disorders such as Tourette syndrome body dysmorphic or pathological gambling. The biomedical signal processing is directed to the development of specific algorithm for every specific kind of signal, to reach a more accurate diagnosis (2). The biomedical signal processing is divided in several steps: registration, processing and classification (3). Electrocardiography, phonocardiography, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electromyography are examples of biomedical signals. The information of these biomedical signals may not be obtained immediately, needing complex signal processing tools (4). The main objectives of biomedical signal processing are (4): -reduce the subjectivity of manual measurements. -extract features in order to characterize information contained in a signal. -noise reduction. -mathematical (signal) modelling and simulation for a better understanding of physiological processes. In the present work we are going to analyse magnetoencephalograms, which are a record of magnetic fields produced by electrical activity within the brain. In spite of the fact that neurophysiological techniques have broadly been used in the investigation of mental disorders, and although they made possible the creation of statistical models with high sensitivity and specificity, their use in every day practice has been quite limited. Surely, this is partly due to the incorrect choice of analysis process, which would bring about the loss of significant information contained in the brain signal (5). In this point, the nonlinear analysis methods, such as complexity become important for extracting clinically significant information hidden in the signal. The analysis of complex parameters, obtained from EEG or MEG, estimates the predictability of brain oscillations and/or the number of oscillators that produce the recorded signals (5). Moreover, since complexity parameters are sensitive to the temporal components of brain activity, their study may allow us to reach a better understanding of the dynamical nature of psychiatric disorders. We chose the Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) algorithm, which works by scanning through the input string for successively longer substrings until it finds one that has not previously been registered. This algorithm has been used to assess several mental disorders such as Alzheimer, Schizophrenia, Depression or ADHD. In the present work we analysed the MEG recordings of 13 patients diagnosed of OCD (DSM and ICD) and 60 healthy controls, using the LZC algorithm. The results show a positive correlation between age and LZC values within controls and OCD patients. LZC values were smaller in the OCD group although the regression coefficient in the OCD group was bigger than in the control group, showing a completely different behaviour of LZC among OCD and control group. An asymmetry between both lateral regions was found in the OCD sample but not in the controls. Moreover, the frontal region of OCD showed alterations that could be related with previous findings in the frontal lobe.",

      "title": "Stress Characterization is a more Reliable Approach for the Assessment of Metabolism than Blood Glucose Value",
      "abstract": "The stress reaction (acute, repetitive or chronic stress patterns) is a non-specific response of an organism to a pathological state. The metabolic characteristics of these stress patterns are well documented. Recognizing the interrelation between a stress-induced pathological state and the relevant pattern of the resultant stress reaction can provide a more accurate assessment of actual cellular metabolism than an approach relying on blood glucose values. Stress activation is obligatorily associated with negative energetic balance in affected cellular metabolism, which is reversed by elimination of the stressor. Prolongation of the stress reaction is a marker indicating the ineffective elimination of the causal stressor. Chronic stress induces progressive self-generating cellular metabolic dysfunction, resulting in the development of both diabetic and ischaemic disorders. Chronic stress conditions are characterized by reductions in inducible metabolic capacity, acute stress tolerance, and functional performance, accompanied by stress-specific micro- and macroscopic alterations. Chronic stress can be activated by both somatic and psychomental stressors. Diabetes, starvation, obesity, ageing, pregnancy, and any chronic disease state of a vital organ are associated with activation of stress reaction. The increased susceptibility of diabetic patients on gliflozins to the development of postoperative euglycaemic ketoacidosis can be explained by a reduction in chronic stress-associated acute stress tolerance, related mainly to diabetes, and a relative glucose deficiency induced by gliflozin therapy. Chronic hyperglycaemia associated with chronic stress should be considered both the primary cause and the secondary consequence of cellular dysmetabolism. Achievement of near-normoglycaemia is a beneficial effect but is not a causal intervention",

      "title": "Physical Activity, Stress Reactivity, and Stress-Mediated Pathophysiology",
      "abstract": "Patients with chronic pain are more likely to be sedentary and less likely to engage in regular physical activity or exercise than their healthy peers. Although individuals with chronic pain report many of the same obstacles to physical activity as healthy people, they also often attribute their lack of activity to disability or pain as a result of their condition and a fear of exacerbating symptoms. This perspective could be particularly detrimental for these individuals as their low levels of activity and large amounts of sedentary time put them at a greater risk for worsening their disability (McCracken & Samuel, 2007), as well as other medical conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and stroke. This process has been characterized by some as a vicious cycle; these patients are inactive, at least in part, as a result of their pain condition, which leads to greater disability, which in turn decreases the likelihood of them being physically active (Leeuw et al., 2007). The relatively low level of activity in these patients is especially troubling when considering the large and growing body of evidence demonstrating that exercise and increased levels of daily physical activity can provide benefits to individuals with chronic pain beyond enhanced physical fitness. The benefits of regular exercise for these patients may include improvements in pain symptoms, physical and functional capacity, fatigue, anxiety, depressed mood, and quality of life. For low to moderate intensity prescriptions, the consensus appears to be that chronic pain patients can engage in exercise safely and without fear of exacerbating symptoms. Clinicians, for the most part, no longer subscribe to the view that rest and activity avoidance are the best methods of managing chronic pain symptoms. In fact, following decades of research, a recommendation for exercise or increased physical activity has become a standard element of multicomponent therapies for all manner of chronic pain conditions (Iversen, 2012).",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is a major feature of the illness. Like many of the other aspects of the illness, however, it has not been studied extensively in older patients. Several studies of older patients with a lifetime course of poor outcome and chronic institutional stay have indicated that some patients manifest evidence of profound cognitive impairments on a cross-sectional basis and cognitive and functional decline over longitudinal follow-ups of 30 months or longer. Risk factors for this decline include lower educational attainment and more severe positive symptoms, but do not include more severe symptoms of physical illness. These impairments have been shown to be discriminable from normal age-related changes and from the changes associated with Alzheimer's Disease. In contrast, studies of patients with no history of lifetime institutional stay find no such evidence of either age-related changes in cognitive functioning or longitudinal decline in cognitive or functional status. Since there is accumulating evidence of progressive brain changes over the lifespan in patients with schizophrenia, the course of cognitive deficits in later life will remain an important topic, both for understanding the lifetime course of schizophrenia and for developing interventions aimed at reduction of disability in the illness.",

Missed diagnosis is a common problem, with the conditions being mistaken for psychiatric or movement disorder. Timely diagnosis depends on methodical examinations that characterize the chronology and tempo of key symptoms, family history, and neurological features, and brain images that reveal telltale patterns of atrophy or dysfunction. Genetic, blood, and CSF assays, and EEG are indicated where family history is positive or illness progression rapid. As non-Alzheimer dementias pose many clinical and psychosocial problems, optimal care requires a multidisciplinary team, empowered carers, and leverage of community resources.

      "abstract": "“Antisocial behavior” is a very broad term encompassing acts ranging in severity from misdemeanors such as petty theft to murder. Thus a specific role for neurochemical or neuroendocrine factors certainly cannot be postulated or elucidated to explain such behavior in its entirety. Even when the term “antisocial” is used in other than a legal or criminological sense – for example, when it is applied in psychiatric diagnostics in an attempt to define and understand individual human behavior more fully – it remains overinclusive. From a clinical standpoint, the term “antisocial” most often signifies antisocial personality disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1952, 1968, 1980), which in the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) is considered an “axis II” personality disorder, which may or may not coexist with certain “axis I” clinical syndromes or other conditions. Simply stated, this means that, according to current diagnostic nomenclature, an antisocial personality disorder theoretically could coexist with an organic mental disorder, substance use disorder, paranoid disorder, depressive disorder, psychosexual disorder, and so on.",

      "title": "Post‐traumatic stress disorder as moderator of other mental health conditions",
      "abstract": "The comorbidity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a range of other mental disorders is common. This comorbidity is often attributed to either overlapping symptoms between PTSD and other disorders or to the variety of psychiatric conditions that can arise in the wake of exposure to a traumatic experience. However, this comorbidity may also be due to the fact that PTSD can moderate the onset or severity of other psychiatric symptoms or disorders. This is an important issue, because it has implications for how patients affected by the array of symptoms that can emerge after trauma may be most efficiently managed. Our knowledge of how PTSD can impact other disorders rests on longitudinal studies that have assessed PTSD and other conditions, and have typically conducted cross-lagged or time-series analyses. This approach allows us to determine the extent to which each condition impacts other disorders at later assessments. Convergent evidence indicates that PTSD can precede or exacerbate depression, anxiety disorders, suicidality, substance abuse, eating disorders, and psychosis1. Furthermore, PTSD can precede a range of physical and behavioral indicators, including chronic pain and tobacco use. There is also evidence from network analysis indicating how symptoms of PTSD may impact other psychiatric symptoms. Network analysis conceptualizes psychopathological states as resulting from causal paths between different symptoms – rather than emerging from an underlying disease state2, 3. For example, the PTSD symptom of nightmares may play a causal role in contributing to sleep disturbance, which in turn leads to concentration deficits and irritability. Numerous studies using network analysis have shown that specific PTSD symptoms can influence problems across other conditions, including depression and anx­iety disorders4. In explaining the role of PTSD as a mediator of the relationship between trauma exposure and onset of other psychiatric disorders, there are several mechanisms that can be considered, and these arguably function in an interactive manner. One key potential mechanism is the impact of PTSD on the capacity to down-regulate emotional distress. It is well documented that PTSD involves impaired emotion regulation, and it is possible that this impairment predisposes people to develop new psychiatric disorders or worsens others5. The capacity to regulate emotions in PTSD can be related to the well-documented deficits in executive functioning6. Deficient working memory and attentional capacity can limit the extent to which one can regulate emotions, which can result in greater risk for mental health problems. Moreover, avoidance is a key symptom of PTSD, and this can trigger a cascade of strategies that can be maladaptive. Avoidance can involve situations or thoughts and memories related to the traumatic experience. This tendency can generalize to more pervasive avoidance of social networks, emotional states, and activities that promote good mental health. This can lead to a worsening of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric conditions. Another common form of avoidance for people with PTSD is self-medicating with prescription or non-prescription substances to numb the distress that is experienced along with traumatic memories. This behaviour can not only lead to substance abuse, which has been documented in longitudinal studies of PTSD, but also facilitate other psychiatric problems, because issues may not be addressed in a constructive manner. Avoidance tendencies can also result in not seeking help from mental health services, which can impede early intervention or adequate treatment for other psychiatric disorders. The DSM-5 explicitly recognizes the presence of harmful behaviors in PTSD, including such risk-taking behaviors as dangerous driving, severe alcohol use, and self-harm. These reactions are conceptualized as a result of the extreme arousal and the difficulties in impulse control that can be experienced by people with PTSD7. These behaviors can lead to a range of events and habits triggering repetitive cycles of exposure to trauma. This can compound the sensitization that has been reported in PTSD, in which the condition results in neural sensitivity to threats and stressors in one's environment, such that the person is more reactive to these events. One of the strongest transdiagnostic predictors of risk for mental health problems is represented by maladaptive or catastrophic appraisals about oneself or the environment8. A key feature of PTSD is the tendency to engage in catastrophic appraisals after the traumatic experience, and these appraisals can generalize to many aspects of a person's life, such as one's self-esteem, trust in others, fears of negative evaluations, germs, or self-blame. These cognitive tendencies are major risk factors for an array of psychiatric conditions, including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Relatedly, the tendency to ruminate is well documented after trauma, and this habit of repeatedly thinking about negative events is a major risk factor for many psychiatric conditions. In considering these various mechanisms for how PTSD can moderate other psychiatric problems, it is worth noting that many of the risk factors reviewed here may be present prior to trauma exposure, and in fact predispose the person to developing PTSD. These elements can be intensified as PTSD develops, and then contribute to other psychiatric conditions which have a shared vulnerability. In this context, it is especially worth recognizing the emerging evidence on shared genetic vulnerabilities to a range of psychiatric disorders9. In the wake of trauma exposure and PTSD development, gene expression can predispose an individual to develop other psychiatric disorders by means of the shared genetic vulnerability. Overall, this evidence reflects the interactive multifactorial nature of the processes explaining how PTSD can lead to the onset or worsening of other psychiatric conditions. Understanding how PTSD can impact on other psychological problems is an important area of future research, because it has important treatment implications. Targeting PTSD may have downstream benefits for many problems beyond the specific domain of that disorder.",

Does stress cause or exacerbate related pathophysiological disease processes?The stress phenomenon is illustrated and the impact of stress on the nervous system, neurodegenerative diseases, and mental disorders is examined. The connection between stress and the hippocampus - and its association with memory functions - is described. In particular, the pathophysiological significance of stress in Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia is investigated.Stress plays a major role in various (patho)physiological processes associated with neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders. In principle, stress has the potency to exert either ameliorating or detrimental effects. The specific outcome depends on multiple variables. However, the amount of stress experienced in relation to activated physiological processes that aim at successful coping and positive adjustments (i.e., stress response) most often is overwhelming - and may thus become detrimental in the long-term. Moreover, the hippocampus is sensitive to stress, and its involvement in neurodegeneration - in the course of stress-related disease processes - may account for severe clinical disabilities (e.g., memory loss).Stress has a major impact upon neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders. It plays a significant role in susceptibility, progress, and actual outcome. Also, subjective or individual differences have to be taken into account. However, stress - especially 'adequate' acute stress (stress that is not overwhelming) - may even improve performance/biological functions and be beneficial in certain cases.",

      "abstract": "1. Sixty-two patients were studied in whom organic disease of the central nervous system was probably induced, at least in part, by metabolic deficiency. Mental symptoms were present in 25 of these cases. 2. The deficiency is termed a \"neurometabolic crisis.\" It may be caused by absolute or relative avitaminosis, by starvation of various origins or by endocrine factors. 3. Causation of the mental symptoms in certain cases is outlined, schematically, as a complex system of vicious circles, in which the two factors of anxiety and metabolic imbalance both play a part. 4. In view of our personal good results in such cases, a high-vitamin diet is recommended for tentative trial not only in acute or subacute psychoses characterized by delirium and amentia, but also in acute episodes of the organic-reaction type which occur in the course of schizophrenic and manic-depressive psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive deterioration can reliably be measured after procedures requiring anesthesia and surgery. Cardiac surgery has had the spotlight because of the high reported incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in early studies, but such effects occur after other surgical procedures as well. “Early” postoperative cognitive dysfunction should be considered as a different phenomenon, relating to acute pharmacological, physiological, and stress-related recovery. The focus should be on what is affecting patients at 3 months, 12 months, and 5 years later. Like with many other aspects of perioperative risk, a significant element is the patient’s preoperative cognitive status. We now know that up to one-third of overtly “normal” elective cardiac surgical patients enter surgery with some degree of pre-existing cognitive impairment or, when applying psychogeriatric measures, mild cognitive impairment. The latter is a known prodrome or early stage of the amyloid associated Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Inflammatory responses during cardiac surgery have been recognized for years, but our understanding of the complexity of systemic inflammatory response has grown significantly with the ability to assay neurohumoral markers such as interleukins. The blood–brain barrier is made vulnerable by both pre-existing disorders (mild cognitive impairment/amyloid; vascular disease) and by the inflammatory response to surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass. Inflammation affecting the brain at this time may set in motion accelerated neurological and hence cognitive decline that, despite an initial recovery and even functional improvement, may proceed to further long-term decline at an accelerated rate in susceptible individuals. Clinical data are emerging from longer-term studies to support this concern, but evidence for effective preventive or therapeutic strategies is limited.",

      "abstract": "Neurosyphilis is caused by the invasion of Treponema pallidum into the central nervous system. General paresis (GP) is a type of neurosyphilis. The main manifestation of general paresis is dementia; however, this is different from the other types of dementia, which can be cured by adequate doses of penicillin in the early stage. Neurosyphilis is the \"great imitator\" because it can mimic many types of medical disorders. In addition, the manifestations of neurosyphilis are not typical. Psychiatric disorders as a cause of general paresis have become more common due to the use of antibiotics. Patients with a psychiatric manifestation are often misdiagnosed. The purpose of this study was to explore the differences in the clinical and neuropsychological characteristics of general paresis between patients misdiagnosed as having a primary psychiatric disease and patients diagnosed correctly upon seeing a doctor. The results may assist clinicians in the early identification of neurosyphilis with a mental disorder.The demographic and clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging and neuropsychological characteristics were analysed in 55 general paresis patients with psychiatric disorders, including 29 patients misdiagnosed as primary psychiatric disease and 26 patients diagnosed as having general paresis after being seen once by a doctor.All of the patients had positive assay results for cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) Treponema pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA). Only 43.3 % of misdiagnosed patients and 30.8 % of general paresis patients had positive results for the CSF rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test; 96.4 % patients had abnormal neuroimaging. Mood disturbances were the most common psychiatric disorder in the general paresis patients, especially agitation, between the two groups (patients with general paresis who were misdiagnosed as having primary psychiatric disease and patients who had never been misdiagnosed) (p = 0.011).Our findings reinforce the importance of performing serologic testing for syphilis. This should be a part of the evaluation of patients with psychiatric disorders, especially patients with cognitive impairment. When the syphilis serology is positive, the patient should be examined thoroughly for neurosyphilis by lumbar puncture. Brain imaging could also aid the physician in discriminating these patients from those with a functional mental disorder.",

La segunda es que la mayoria de ellos corresponde a una fase inicial de la EA, sin demencia. Nuestros comentarios son dos. El primero es que no se necesitaria tener una demencia para sospechar o diagnosticar una EA probable.

      "abstract": "Objective: To describe the concept of memory impairment in schizophrenia and the clinical implications of this concept in terms of patient assessment and neuroleptic drug use. Method: Narrative literature review. Results: Individuals suffering from schizophrenia normally exhibit some degree of memory impairment. Recent work in psychopathology indicates that the impairment is comprehensive, involving the sensory, short-term, and long-term memory stores. Memory impairment appears to be a primary symptom of the disease, and its underlying causes are likely organic. A number of medications, however (for example, traditional neuroleptics and drugs that have pronounced anticholinergic activity), may cause or exacerbate impairment. In particular, anticholinergic agents used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms, a common complication of neuroleptic drugs, appear to have a deleterious effect on memory. Conclusions: Memory impairment is an important consideration in the clinical assessment and management of patients with schizophrenia. The use of atypical antipsychotics like risperidone appears to have no impact on memory function; because risperidone is associated with a low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects, it can obviate the need for anticholinergic medications—thus offering greater hope of nondebilitative intervention. The advent of medications that are safer (on cognition) could also lead to generally better outcomes by facilitating compliance with drug regimens and rehabilitation programs.",

      "title": "On the role of neuropsychiatric symptoms as markers for Alzheimer´s disease in an era of disease modifying treatments",
      "abstract": "Abstract Early and reliable detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is fundamental in an era with novel disease modifying treatments on the market. Late in life emerging neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) (e.g., apathy, anxiety, depression) have been reported prevalent among cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults, as well as among patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Findings have indicated that NPS can emerge prior to MCI in ∼50% of cases that subsequently develop a neurocognitive disorder (NCD). Additionally, ∼30% of AD patients have been reported to have received a primary psychiatric diagnosis before their final NCD diagnosis. Combined, these studies point to NPS as important early clinical manifestations of AD. NPS have furthermore been related to several clinically negative outcomes, such as reduced quality of life, increased caregiver burden and earlier institutionalization. Some reports even indicate that NPS can be stronger related to these outcomes than cognition. Importantly, several studies have demonstrated NPS to be predictive of future cognitive decline, dementia, or AD. For example, anxiety in non‐demented subjects has consistently been shown to interact with beta‐amyloid yielding accelerated cognitive decline. NPS are further demonstrated related to AD neuropathological changes including beta‐amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration. For instance, beta‐amyloid in initially CU elderly has been demonstrated associated with steeper development of NPS over time. Intriguingly, an earlier study has reported the overall burden of NPS to precede memory deficits in its association with early tau deposition in amyloid‐beta positive CU subjects, results supportive of NPS as early markers of dementing biochemical processes. Despite this growing evidence of being both prevalent and early prognostic markers, as well as associated with AD pathology, NPS are only given diminutive consideration in contemporary clinical AD diagnostic criteria. Perhaps so since the added value of NPS in such criteria has rarely been investigated. Consequently, CU subjects with a positive NPS and biomarker status face the risk of not being eligible for a disease modifying treatment since they formally do not fulfill diagnostic criteria for AD. Hence, studies exploring the added value of NPS in clinical diagnostic criteria for AD are prompted.",

      "title": "Night Eating Syndrome Presenting as Anorexia in an Athlete",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Night eating syndrome (NES) was first described by Stunkard in 1955 as \"morning anorexia, evening or nocturnal hyperphagia in a fully conscious state, and insomnia\" (21). Over time, the syndrome has been further characterized to distinguish it from other forms of nighttime eating. Although some debate still exists, NES encompasses a few key behaviors, including evening hyperphagia (or late night eating before initiating sleep) and eating after awakening from sleep (night eating) either in a fully or semi-conscious state (11). This is in contrast to binge eating disorder (BED), which describes episodes of consuming large quantities of food in discrete time periods without control (23), or sleep related eating disorder (SRED), which refers to involuntary nocturnal eating, often of bizarre foods or inedible items, that occurs after awakening (25). Late-night eating also can be found in other diagnoses, such as bulimia nervosa or dissociative disorders, but in these cases it is usually a part of a group of symptoms rather than the central problem. The hallmark of NES is a delay of caloric intake until the evening and night hours. Birketvedt revealed that night eaters consume 56% of their daily caloric intake between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., compared with 15% by control subjects (5). The foods consumed during episodes of evening hyperphagia and night eating tend to be carbohydrate-rich (7), with a high carbohydrate to protein ratio of 7:1. Nighttime awakenings are common among night eaters, and >50% of these episodes were associated with food intake, compared with 0% in control subjects (5). CASE PRESENTATION A 19-yr-old college softball player was referred to a sports medicine clinic by her team's strength staff and teammates for not eating during the daytime and a concern for possible anorexia nervosa. For most of the day, she reported a lack of appetite until approximately 3 p.m., when she ate her first meal. A teammate reported her to be seen pushing her food around the plate and not eating. She attempted to restrict calories during meals because of a bloated feeling in the morning. She denied binging or purging activities. She was seen 3 months earlier by another physician for a complaint of insomnia. She denied difficulty with initiating sleep, but experienced frequent nighttime awakenings, on average three to four times in one night. She had one roommate, and she denied excessive noise, poorly regulated temperature, or light disturbances. She did not discuss her nighttime eating with that physician. She also denied nightmares or night terrors. She had attempted over-the-counter sleep aids without improvement in her symptoms. She was started on zolpidem tartrate, which did not diminish the number of awakenings. Upon each awakening she would consume a snack, consisting of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as cookies or crackers, frequently more than 1000 calories over the night. Although she tried to refrain from eating, she felt unsatisfied and unable to reinitiate sleep until consuming food. Generally, she reported being conscious while eating. However, at times she only would become aware of the episodes by the food wrappers surrounding her bed the next morning. After eating she easily returned to sleep, but reawakened 1-2 h later. Her roommate reported having her personal food confiscated by the patient at night and engaging in conversations that the patient could not recall the following day. The following morning after an episode, she experienced a moderate amount of guilt related to her eating and modest weight gain of approximately 7 lb. She admitted to a mildly depressed mood and intermittent anhedonia. She reported anxiety related to increased life stressors over the past few months associated with softball, classes, and a new relationship. She denied having difficulty concentrating or a decline in academic work. However, she noticed decreased endurance and performance during softball practice and competitions, especially with morning activities during which she felt tired, bloated, and groggy. By not eating for most of the day, she often lacked enough energy to complete an entire afternoon practice. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. At the time of the visit about eating disorder concern, she was no longer taking any medication or supplements. She denied a personal or family history of eating disorders. A complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Upon examination, vital signs were normal; height was 5'6,\" and weight was 160 lb. The physical and psychiatric exams were unremarkable. Her Zung depression scale score was 24, and her night eating questionnaire score was 49. EPIDEMIOLOGY Although NES was described initially in the obesity literature, it is not limited to this demographic. The syndrome's prevalence among the general population is estimated at 1.5% (19). Up to 8.9% of obesity clinic patients meet the criteria for NES (16). However, the diagnostic patterns do not appear to be different for obese and non-obese individuals with NES (7). A recent study investigating familial aggregation showed that individuals with NES were more likely to have an affected first-degree relative than control subjects (OR = 4.9) (13). Recently, the link between psychiatric illness and NES has become of interest because of its association with stress and depression. Lundgren et al. found that 12.3% of patients in an outpatient psychiatric clinic met the diagnostic criteria for NES and that these patients had a higher rate of substance abuse and atypical antipsychotic use than patients without NES (12). DIAGNOSIS As NES is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV), variance in diagnostic criteria is widely seen in both past and present studies. In a recent evaluation of diagnostic criteria, Allison et al. report that the definition of night eating has ranged from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. to the more general \"after the evening meal,\" while the proportion of total calories consumed has varied from 25% to 50% (2). These inconsistencies create some difficulty in generalizing investigational results to the general population, as well as clearly identifying whether a patient meets criteria for the actual syndrome or is a variant of normal. In reality, many people have episodes of late-night eating, and in households that often spend evenings watching television, after-dinner snacking may be the norm. In addition, there is variation in the average dinnertime among cultures, with the average person in the United States eating between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., while the average person in Europe has dinner between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The question of whether to include NES in the DSM-V has prompted further investigation into the diagnostic tools and criteria currently used. In an attempt to assess two screening instruments, Vander Wal et al. found that use of a single simple screening question had adequate sensitivity but poor specificity to identify patients correctly with NES (24). Additionally, while the NEQ was correlated positively with increasing diagnostic detail, there was an inability to achieve both high sensitivity and specificity with varying cut points. Vander Wal concluded that the difference between eating late at night versus waking from sleep to eat might be the key to distinguishing NES as a true pathologic state. By evaluating several items from the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Allison et al. found that three items appear to be core aspects of the disorder: 1) evening hyperphagia and/or nocturnal eating, 2) initial insomnia, and 3) awakenings from sleep (4). Their analysis suggests that the presence of morning anorexia and a delayed morning meal added little additional information. The NEQ has evolved alongside research to characterize NES. Developed as a standardized screening tool for diagnosing NES, the current version is a 14-item questionnaire that addresses both behavioral and psychological aspects of the syndrome. The questions investigate the following aspects of NES: morning hunger and timing of first food consumption, cravings, control over eating before bedtime and during nighttime awakenings, percentage of post-dinner food consumption, initial insomnia, frequency of awakenings, associated food consumption during awakenings and awareness during these episodes, and mood disturbance (4). By varying the cut score, Allison et al. calculated that a positive predictive value of up to 77% can be attained (2). While the NEQ has been shown to be an efficient and valid measure of the severity of NES, its primary use is as a screening tool and it should not replace clinical interview for diagnosis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY In general, it has been recognized that the pattern of intake rather than the total calories ingested is different in NES subjects compared with controls (17). NES has been linked to changes in the circadian rhythm and disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Therefore, NES has been described as delayed circadian eating patterns superimposed upon normal sleep-wake cycles (17). An inpatient study by Allison et al. showed a decrease in overnight ghrelin levels, a stomach-derived appetite stimulant, compared with control subjects, whereas insulin and glucose increased at night (1). No difference was found in secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), melatonin, leptin, cortisol, or prolactin. In comparison, Birketvedt et al. found attenuated secretions of nocturnal leptin (an adipocyte-derived appetite suppressant) and melatonin, whereas cortisol was increased (5). In a small study comparing the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone among people with NES and control subjects, an attenuated response of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol release was observed, suggesting an overexpressed HPA (10). The authors interpret this finding to be a result of the constant stressful stimuli to which people with NES are exposed, but they note that, alternately, it may be a direct result of a fasting state. They hypothesize that the behaviors of disordered sleep and increased nighttime appetite may be related directly to the neurotransmitter alterations that are caused by an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Based upon the observed caloric intake and neuroendocrine assays in a study of 15 women with NES and 14 control subjects, Goel et al. theorized that NES might represent dissociation between a central timing mechanism in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other presumed regulator systems in the central nervous system, stomach, or liver (9). Again, the question of causality arises in interpreting whether the observed differences in ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, insulin, and glucose amplitudes and timing are altered independently compared with control subjects or are results of the abnormal behaviors of nocturnal waking and eating. TREATMENT Researchers have explored several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic options for NES, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, topiramate, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation training, and light therapy. Lundgren et al. demonstrated elevated binding of midbrain serotonin transporters, which may amplify the reuptake of serotonin and impair postsynaptic serotonin transmission (14). This theory can explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are useful in treating individuals with NES. Early studies and case reports related reduction in night eating episodes and decrease in overall caloric intake to both short-term (2 wk) (15) and long-term (6-15 months) (20) SSRI use. In an 8-wk randomized, placebo-controlled study of sertraline for NES, 12/17 in the sertraline group responded to therapy compared with 3/17 in the control group (16). Seven of the 12 responders in the sertraline group had a remission or complete resolution of symptoms, compared with one of the three responders in the control group. This study was different than previous SSRI trials because it included a small number of normal weight subjects. Of these, two of the three in the sertraline group responded, compared with zero of three in the control group. Participants in the study group had a 30% chance of responding at 2 wk and a 50% chance of responding between weeks 4 and 8. Overall, the sertraline group had a significant reduction in the symptoms of NES, including a reduction in nocturnal ingestions (80%), lower caloric intake after the evening meal (32.5%), and weight loss (approximately 1 lb·wk−1). The changes in night eating did not correlate with changes in depressive symptoms, which were modest at baseline. Because individuals with NES report greater levels of depression and anxiety in addition to displaying evidence of elevated stress (increased cortisol and CRH), Pawlow et al. designed a study to evaluate effects of relaxation training (18). The study focused upon the short-term effects on a group (N = 10) randomized to abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation technique (APRT) compared with control subjects (N = 10). Participants in the APRT group reported lower levels of anxiety and stress and higher levels of relaxation immediately after a session, which correlated to lower levels of salivary cortisol. After 7 d of home practice, the significant decrease in levels of anxiety and stress persisted in the APRT group compared with control subjects. The relaxation group also had a significant increase in morning appetite and decrease in evening appetite rating, but had a nonsignificant decrease in days with post-bedtime eating. Bright-light therapy has been suggested as a therapy for weight loss in obese subjects (6). A case report of an obese woman with NES demonstrated resolution of night eating symptoms when exposed to light therapy, in addition to decreased depression scores (8). NES symptoms recurred when light therapy was discontinued. Light therapy's ability to alter the circadian pattern changes seen in NES may explain this therapeutic observation. DISCUSSION We used the following provisional criteria outlined by Birketvedt (1999) (5) to diagnose our athlete with NES: 1) morning anorexia, even if breakfast is eaten; 2) evening hyperphagia, in which >50% of daily energy intake is consumed after the evening meal; 3) awakenings at least once per night; 4) consumption of snacks during awakenings; 5) repetition of provisional criteria longer than 3 months; and 6) does not meet the criteria for bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder. To our knowledge, there have been no studies or case reports focusing upon NES in the athletic population. However, there is a well-accepted association between sports participation and eating disorders. While determining the true prevalence in athletes has been difficult, one Norwegian study estimated that 13.5% of elite athletes have eating disorders, defined as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified, compared with 4.6% in the control population (22). Our patient was diagnosed before the Allison et al. (2009) proposed diagnostic criteria for night eating syndrome (3). Our patient fulfilled these criteria as well as the older Birketvedt criteria. With regard to NES, there are specific issues to consider in the athletic population. First, although morning anorexia may exist, athletes may force themselves to eat breakfast to meet the energy demands of early morning practice or competition. Similarly, athletes may appear to have a normal percentage of preevening meal calories, but their calorie requirements may far exceed their intake. As in our athlete, symptoms of underperformance as a result of a negative energy balance and inadequate sleep may be the driving factor to seek medical attention. Finally, although some athletes may notice weight gain, overall they are less likely to be clinically overweight or obese given the intense training required to perform at a high level. Our athlete's initial complaint was of insomnia, and she was instructed initially in basic sleep-hygiene practices. Her nighttime eating was not mentioned on the first visit, and the prescription of a sleep aid may have exacerbated her problem. Once NES was diagnosed, she was started on sertraline (50 mg daily). She was titrated gradually up to a dose of 200 mg daily over the next 6 wk. She was simultaneously sent to the college mental health center for cognitive-behavioral therapy. She went for four visits and reported a significant reduction in symptoms with the treatments. Although she awoke on average once per night, down from the previous three to four times each night, she was usually able to return to sleep almost immediately without eating. She developed regular eating patterns, consuming three regular meals per day with one to two snacks. Her mood improved and anhedonia also resolved. She continued softball participation throughout her treatment, with noticeable improvements and increased consistency in performance once her night eating resolved.",

      "abstract": "Somatic symptoms include a range of physical experiences, such as pain, muscle tension, body shaking, difficulty in breathing, heart palpitation, blushing, fatigue, and sweating. Somatic symptoms are common in major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and some other psychiatric disorders. However, the etiology of somatic symptoms remains unclear. Somatic symptoms could be a response to emotional distress in patients with those psychiatric conditions. Increasing evidence supports the role of aberrant serotoninergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission in somatic symptoms. The physiological alterations underlying diminished serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) signaling may contribute to impaired signal transduction, reduced 5-HT, or NE release from terminals of presynaptic neurons, and result in alternations in function and/or number of receptors and changes in intracellular signal processing. Multiple resources of data support each of these mechanisms. Animal models have shown physiological responses, similar as somatic symptoms seen in psychiatric patients, after manipulations of 5-HT and NE neurotransmission. Human genetic studies have identified many single-nucleotide polymorphisms risk loci associated with somatic symptoms. Several neuroimaging findings support that somatic symptoms are possibly associated with a state of reduced receptor binding. This narrative literature review was to discuss the involvement of serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the pathophysiology of somatic symptoms. Future research combining neuroimaging techniques and genetic analysis to further elucidate the biological mechanisms of somatic symptoms and to develop novel treatment strategies is needed.",

      "abstract": "Due to the high prevalence of different levels of memory disorders and amnesia, many psychiatry and psychology referrals are due to the fear of diseases that cause dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. However, many of these disorders have internal causes and can be classified as functional cognitive disorders. Although the diagnosis of cognitive disorder is made by ruling out organic causes, it is difficult to diagnose functional disorders, thus most of these disorders are not diagnosed. It has been determined that depression, anxiety and behavioral disorders can be precursors of mild cognitive impairment, but it has not been determined whether functional cognitive impairment can also be a trigger or precursor for organic cognitive disorders related to dementia. The typical form of functional cognitive disorder overlaps with the components of attention and concentration. The coexistence of these disorders with depression can make the diagnosis of functional cognitive disorders more difficult. Therefore, it is important to rule out pseudodementia due to depression before making such a diagnosis. Since functional cognitive impairment occur in the midlife period, these disorders are differentially diagnosed with early-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Regardless of the research conducted in the field of diagnosing functional cognitive disorders, no definitive diagnostic criteria have been determined for these disorders, and the long-term prognosis of these disorders is also unknown.",

Many people with a subjective memory complaint have cognitive test score abnormalities, often at a rate higher than those who are not troubled by their memory3; of these, many go on to develop dementia.\n\nThe evaluation of people with cognitive impairment who do not meet the criteria for dementia is an area of intense investigation. No group has contributed more than the Mayo Clinic investigators. They have reified criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and identified subtypes. People with MCI can be found with and without a predominant amnestic component, and further with and without impairment in other cognitive domains. Some subsequent epidemiologic reports appeared to contradict some of the initial estimates of the risk conferred by MCI.

Leur point commun est l'apparition d'une diminution de la force musculaire, notamment des muscles respiratoires conditionnant le pronostic vital. La survenue d'une insuffisance respiratoire est en general progressive et insidieuse. Son diagnostic repose sur des examens cliniques et para-cliniques. Pour la plupart de ces pathologies, il n’existe aucun traitement curatif. Seule la ventilation mecanique associee a une prise en charge cardiaque adaptee permet, pour certaines pathologies, une survie prolongee avec une qualite de vie satisfaisante. Son indication au long cours peut se poser de differentes manieres : soit au decours d'une decompensation respiratoire aigue revelatrice de la maladie ou survenant en l'absence de suivi, soit de facon programmee (le cas le plus frequent) dans le cadre d’un suivi pluridisciplinaire. Les criteres d'indication retenus sont l’existence d’au moins un signe clinique evoquant une atteinte respiratoire, associee a une PaCO2 > 45 mmgH ou a une CV < 50% ou a une desaturation nocturne. Toutefois ces indications sont a nuancer en fonction de la pathologie et de la clinique. D’autre part, il existe egalement tres peu d'etudes ayant pu demontrer l'efficacite de la ventilation sur la survie, ceci est du a la rarete de ces pathologies et de la duree necessaire des etudes.

Having schizophrenic delusions constitutes a categorically different state from having only wishful illusions or a vivid imagination. In the context of medicine and psychiatry, we certainly encounter stages that signal fundamental differences.

      "abstract": "Atypical forms of motor neuron disease represent a rare and diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders that differ from classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in terms of clinical presentation, genetic background, neuroimaging features, progression rate, and distribution of motor involvement. Diagnostic criteria of these variants include onset at a young or middle age, restriction to a specific anatomical region (bulbar or spinal), exclusive involvement of either the upper or lower motor neuron, the degree of motor neuron degeneration, absence of specific neuroimaging phenomena in certain subtypes, frequent association with other neurological symptoms (e.g., dystonia, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment), and slow progression. Depending on the predominant site of involvement, this pathology can be divided into two major categories: affecting the upper and lower motor neuron. The first group includes primary lateral sclerosis and Mills syndrome. The lower motor neuron group comprises a broader and more heterogeneous spectrum, including progressive bulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy, facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy syndrome, flail arm syndrome, Hirayama disease (monomelic amyotrophy), O’Sullivan-McLeod syndrome, flail leg syndrome, and finger extension weakness and downbeat nystagmus motor neuron disease. A concise clinical characterization of each variant is provided. This article describes original clinical cases of two atypical motor neuron disease variants, i.e. O’Sullivan-McLeod syndrome and flail leg syndrome, analyzed in the context of a comprehensive literature review. Both cases, characterized by lower (peripheral) motor neuron involvement, underscore the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and the complexity of the diagnostic process, illustrating the necessity of a broad, multimodal diagnostic approach and emphasizing the importance of dynamic patient monitoring. In such scenarios, time itself becomes a key diagnostic factor.",

Any memory complaint does not require a “memory clinic” that often does not reassure, whatever the precau- tions taken. Demand for specialist consultation should be reserved for specific pathology suspected dementia. In the absence of cognitive impairment, it is benign oblivion, more and more common with advancing age. It is not possible today to conclude on later risk of dementia, since the studies are contradictory on this point. In contrast, subjective complaints of memory are often associated with depression or increased by certain medications they are primarily associated, in the representations of the patients or their surroundings, to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Current data on the “Mild Cognitive Impairment” do not present it as a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease.

For a lay person with no particular knowledge of sleep pathophysiology, “sleep study” often implies what is known to the specialists as nocturnal polysomnogram or PSG. Although this is true in the vast majority of the times, sleep study is not limited to nocturnal polysomnogram but also includes many other sophisticated tests, such as Multiple Sleep latency Test (MSLT), Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), etc. The technology to measure various physiological parameters has evolved over the years and today the methodology used for conducting various sleep studies is perhaps one of the most sophisticated in the medical sciences. Depending on the nature of symptoms, the physicians may order different tests to make the diagnosis and/or treat various sleep disorders. In addition, to the various in-lab sleep studies, other diagnostic tests that may be used in the diagnosis of sleep disorders include home sleep monitoring, actigraphy, etc.",

Various regions of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves may be affected, leading to functional impairment and neuron loss. Neurodegenerative diseases are often categorized by symptoms that may include impairment in cognition, movement, strength, coordination, sensation, or autonomic control. However, the diagnosis of a specific neurodegenerative disease may be misleading, as there is both clinical and neuropathologic overlap among diseases and existing diagnostic tools are not always accurate. For most neurodegenerative diseases, neuronal dysfunction, such as synaptic loss, may occur long before neuronal death takes place (Soto, 2003;Shastry, 2003;Aguzzi and O'Connor, 2010).",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

Although we cannot be sure, we expect the same outcome for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), a medically unexplained condition characterized by disabling fatigue accompanied by infectious, rheumatological, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Although the ailment clearly can occur after severe infection, no convincing data exist to support an infectious (or immunologic) process in disease maintenance. Instead, data point to several possible pathophysiological processes: a covert encephalopathy, impaired physiological capability to respond to physical and mental stressors, and psychological factors related to concerns about effort exacerbating symptoms. Each of these is under intense investigation. In addition, some data do exist to indicate that environmental agents also can elicit a state of chronic fatigue. We expect data to accumulate to support the belief that CFS has multiple causes.",

      "title": "The psychosocial effects of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES)",
      "abstract": "What are Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures? A recent research study conducted by Flinders University explores the experience of a disability which is both hidden and lacks physiological ‘evidence’; a condition which is not understood by health professionals, and results in individuals feeling confused and isolated. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) (also called pseudoseizures) are events resembling epileptic seizures, which are not associated with ictal electrical discharges in the brain but by psychological processes. PNES may be triggered by anxiety, psychological tension and heightened defence against intense emotions. In some cases PNES may be a result of psychological trauma, previous psychiatric history, physical and sexual abuse or posttraumatic stress disorder (Fiszman, Alves-Leon, Nunes, Dandrea, & Figueira, 2004). Health professionals often overlook PNES due to the common misconception that they are “fake” (Benbadis, 2005) or are categorized as a “non-disease” (i.e. not epilepsy) (Bodde, et al., 2009). However, this is a very real condition, with considerable psychosocial implications. People diagnosed with PNES feel anger, shame, helplessness, and experience suicidal ideation (thinking about suicide with some intent but without actually making plans to commit suicide) (Thompson, Isaac, Rowse, Tooth, & Reuber, 2009). Stigma is often attached with this label, fuelled by poor understanding and little education and support following diagnosis (Benbadis, 2010). One complicating factor is that an individual may experience both PNES and epileptic seizures. 15% of people with diagnosed PNES also have epilepsy (Benbadis, 2010), and it is estimated that 10 to 50% of individuals with “intractable seizures” (seizures not adequately controlled by AEDs) have either lone PNES or a combination of epileptic seizures and PNES (LaFrance, et al., 2006). Co-morbidity can cause significant diagnostic and management issues, with health professionals often unable to accurately identify the cause of seizures, and thereby communicate and manage them appropriately. The current study aimed to further explore the psychosocial effects of PNES and their implications for the development of appropriate multidisciplinary support and management strategies.",

Intercurrent illnesses sometimes develop in spite of bed rest, as when myocardial infarction occurs during convalescence from a pelvic or orthopedic operation. In most cases the evil effects of complete bed rest are potentiated by anesthesia, narcotics or other medication or by the results of the original illness. But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position. In any discussion of the effects of complete bed rest it is to be borne in mind that the disorders noted may have been aggravated, or even initiated, by a depression",

The electrodiagnostic practitioner should be aware of those clinical tricks and interpret the electrodiagnostic findings in the clinical context. There are many electrodiagnostic tests that the practitioner can use for the assessment of motor and sensory functions but these tests have also important drawbacks and limitations.

Depending on the clinical presentation, imaging helps determine the most likely anatomical nociceptive source, thereby enhancing the therapeutic approach by targeting a specific lesion. Three pathologic conditions with an approach based on our experience can be described: (1) pure painful syndromes related to single nociceptive sources (e.g., disk pain, active disk pain, and facet joint osteoarthritis pain), (2) multifactorial painful syndromes, representing a combination of several nociceptive sources (such as lumbar spinal stenosis pain, foraminal stenosis pain, and instability pain), and (3) nonspecific CLBP, often explained by postural (muscular) syndromes.",

Most commonly, it presents with seventh cranial nerve palsy, often mimicking stroke and atypical rash (erythema migrans). Atypical presentations include abdominal pain, ileus/pseudo-obstruction and constipation thought to be due to autonomic dysfunction. Other less common presentations include Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormones (SIADH). Lyme disease should be a differential when a patient presents from Lyme endemic areas with abdominal pain, constipation and SIADH in the setting of other causes of gastrointestinal and renal symptoms ruled out.

Neurological complications increase the length of ICU and hospital stay, and reduce the likelihood of return to independent living. Minor neurological complications are very common and often go undiagnosed. It is now recognized that transient and early postoperative problems such as confusion, agitation, and delirium – previously considered self-limiting nuisances – are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a decline in cognitive function in the early postoperative period is predictive of late (five-year) cognitive decline. General considerations Clinical spectrum The spectrum of central nervous system injury during and after cardiac surgery encompasses a wide range of clinical entities ranging from death or persistent vegetative state to subtle changes in memory and concentration: Neurological injury may be: immediate – apparent soon after the patient recovers from anaesthesia; or delayed – with onset after a...",

The neuropsychiatric approach argues that fatigue is a trait (like depression), unrelated to environmental challenges. We propose that fatigue is an internal state that can be measured behaviorally only by applying specific cognitive tasks. PubMed was searched for articles concerning the relation between fatigue and cognitive performance or brain atrophy or functional MRI, distinguishing between the following cognitive domains: learning/memory, cognitive speed/selective attention, language, visuospatial processing, working memory, alerting/vigilance. Only tasks assessing alerting/vigilance are strongly related to fatigue. Areas with brain atrophy in fatigue patients overlap with brain regions activated in healthy controls performing alerting/vigilance tasks. Fatigue is not a compensatory state, nor a psychogenic trait. It is a feeling with behavioral effects that seems to be caused by brain atrophy or a neurochemical dysfunction of the alerting/vigilance system.",

Central nervous system hyperarousal, either as pre-existing and/or induced by psychiatric pathology and worsened by stressful events, as well as aging- and menopause-related physiological decline of sleep mechanisms appears to be at the core of this common sleep disorder. Finally, there is emerging evidence that the levels of physiologic hyperarousal are directly related to the degree of polysomnographically documented sleep disturbance in insomnia patients, suggesting that objective measures of sleep duration in insomnia may be a useful marker of the medical severity of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "La restriction alimentaire chronique correspond a un des troubles du comportement alimentaire observe en particulier dans l’anorexie mentale (AN) de type restrictif, pathologie qui touche essentiellement les adolescentes et les jeunes femmes. En plus de ce comportement restrictif, une activite physique importante est observee chez un grand nombre de patientes (40 a 80% des cas). Cette maladie se traduit par de nombreuses alterations physiologiques comme des perturbations neuroendocrines, metaboliques, osseuses (osteopenie, osteoporose) et ce quelle que soit la cause psychiatrique qui a conduit au developpement de ce comportement. De plus, de nombreux arguments suggerent que l’AN pourrait etre consideree comme un trouble « addictif » qui se manifesterait par une addiction a la perte de poids et/ou a la restriction alimentaire ou encore a l’activite physique suggerant une alteration du systeme dopaminergique de recompense. Ainsi, quelles que soient les origines de la maladie, l’AN entraine des perturbations peripheriques et centrales susceptibles d’etre impliquees dans une premiere phase dite « d’adaptation » permettant aux malades de survivre a ces conditions drastiques. Les patients peuvent par la suite tomber dans une seconde phase de « chronicisation » dans laquelle ces memes facteurs pourraient etre responsables de la degradation de l’etat des malades et conduire, dans les cas les plus graves d’epuisement, a la mort.Notre etude a comme pivot la ghreline, hormone orexigene, dont les concentrations plasmatiques sont augmentees significativement chez les patients anorexiques. Secretee principalement en peripherie par les cellules de l’estomac, elle va cibler plusieurs organes aussi bien peripheriques que centraux. En particulier, au niveau peripherique, cette hormone agit au niveau du foie dont la principale fonction connue est le maintien de l’homeostasie glucidique. Elle agit egalement au niveau du tissu adipeux qui est alors stimule, favorisant ainsi sa croissance avec un stockage des reserves et au niveau musculaire en entrainant entre autre une diminution des reserves de triglycerides. Au niveau du systeme nerveux central, parmi les sites d’action de la ghreline, on trouve les structures impliquees aussi bien dans le controle, qualifie d’homeostatique, de la prise alimentaire represente par l’hypothalamus, que dans le controle, dit hedonique (motivation/recompense), de ce meme comportement correspondant au circuit meso-limbique. Pour etudier son implication dans les mecanismes adaptatifs, et eventuellement, dans l’aggravation de la maladie, nous avons mis au point un modele animal de restriction alimentaire chronique mimant les symptomes physiologiques de l’AN. Notre premier objectif a ete de caracteriser (« phenotypage ») ce modele sur le plan physiologique (metabolique, endocrinien) afin de l’utiliser pour notre deuxieme objectif : evaluation du role de la ghreline comme potentiel facteur predictif de l’evolution de la maladie.Les donnees obtenues valident notre modele comme un modele pertinent pour etudier sur le long terme les alterations physiologiques et centrales decrites dans l’AN de type restrictif. Nous montrons que l’exercice physique modere associe a la restriction alimentaire a des effets stabilisateurs sur de nombreux parametres metaboliques limitant ainsi un epuisement premature des ressources energetiques. En ce qui concerne la ghreline, les concentrations plasmatiques elevees observees dans notre modele pourraient contribuer egalement a une regulation adaptative du metabolisme energetique.",

The inability to focus or maintain concentration is the most disabling aspect of conditions causing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), described as 'brain fog' or even masquerading as dementia. The commonest causes of mild and severe EDS are probably insufficient sleep and poor quality overnight sleep, respectively. Sleep onset or sleep maintainance insomnia can reflect an idiopathic or primary phenomenon but is more often secondary to a variety of disorders, including other primary sleep disorders. In patients with underlying neuropathies, radiculopathies or demyelinating disease, restless legs syndrome (RLS) may be secondary to the primary diagnosis and should not be overlooked. The nocturnal disturbances are usually of more concern to the bed partner who may incur injuries from violent dream enactment.",

      "title": "SOMATOTYPES IN RELATION TO DEMENTIA PRÆCOX",
      "abstract": "The empirical finding of the present study can be stated simply enough : mental patients who have died of other causes than exhaustive diseases include in their number a strikingly large proportion of persons with long, lean, wiry, not merely ectomorphic but to some extent mesomorphic physiques, and a conspicuous lack of those with big-boned, heavily muscled builds. They form a relatively homogeneous group, differing not at all by the nature of their mental illnesses, whether functional or organic in origin : but those who were older at the time of their deaths tend to be bulkier, more rounded, and less thin and fragile than those who died at early ages. To explain these facts is still difficult. Perhaps the patients really differed from an unselected population in these respects before the onset of their illnesses, in which case, one would be led to a hypothesis of a constitutional make-up with nonspecific vulnerability to psychosis. Very probably, the bodily build is not the result of the mental illness, directly or indirectly; if it were, one would expect the effects to show more sharply in cases where the disorder was of long duration. It does not seem plausible that faulty technique on the part of the investigators could have produced such consistent results if readily apparent differences between nosological groups did exist. Possibly mesomorphy is less apparent in a person who is suspended in mid-air instead of standing up, and dead—without muscular tonus—instead of alive; other bias introduced by the fact of death seems less probable, since there were a number of suicides and accidental deaths and none after an exhaustive, lingering illness. It is possible also that some of the differences between our subjects and Sheldon's are attributable to lack of representativeness in his sample as well as in ours. If it is also true that somatotypes change with age, another reason for not using Sheldon's norms as a standard might be found, though such a hypothesis would make the results even harder to explain. The group which is most comparable in age with the 4,000 college students is the very one which is least like them, while advancing age puts enough flesh on these skinny patients to make them appear (perhaps speciously) more like the standardization group. It is credible that American men as a group are not as athletic in their physiques as young college men, but it is very hard to believe that they are as scrawny as the majority of our research population. The general finding of a specific excess and deficit of just two kinds of builds, making up a total of only 35.5% of Sheldon's group, is thus hard to explain away on the basis of sampling error. A possibility which does still remain is that one of these groups—the mesomorphic ectomorphs—is simply less viable, while the other—the predominant mesomorphs and ectomorphic mesomorphs—has greater vitality. It would be easy to test this hypothesis by somatotyping a similar group of patients dying successively in a general hospital, using the same sampling controls as the ones we employed. If significant differences between such a group and ours were still found, it would be possible to say with some confidence that the peculiarities of somatotype were specific to mental illness. In The Varieties of Human Physique, Sheldon has already hedged a little against the possibility of largely negative findings such as the ones presented here, by stating that certain kinds of dysplasia are much more closely related to dementia præcox than are particular somatotypes. The analysis of dysplasia, or disharmony between various regions of the body, requires an additional five sets of judgments for each picture; we decided to forego it. The possibility still remains, then, that more refined and exhaustive somatotyping studies (and we may add, much more time-consuming ones), might bear fruit of positive results if oriented toward the analysis of dysplasia. The difficulties which have plagued this study point dearly to one conclusion: the mere adoption of the technique of somatotyping opens up no royal road to the relationship between physique and psychosis. As it presently stands, the system is not well adapted to application to the very types of research problems to which it seems to have so much to contribute. To have studied with the originator of the technique and to have tried conscientiously to follow the book is not enough to enable one to apply it to subjects who differ appreciably from those Sheldon used and end up confident that the results are not a function of errors in method. Until normative studies have been done upon satisfactory samples of older men, and of women, somatotyping studies will perforce be limited to populations of white college men or others who are similar in sex, ethnic group, and age. Within these limitations, it is still possible to design a study which can result in conclusive findings where we have tried to pioneer. The research population should be a complete or a random sample of hospitalized patients, all physically healthy white males between 18 and 25 years old. They should be somatotyped independently by two or more observers who have no knowledge of the patients or their diagnoses, preferably using the anthropometric technique or at least validating anthroposcopic judgments by measurements and reference to the tables in Sheldon's book in a considerable sub-sample. Groups should be equated for length of hospitalization and for duration of illness. Diagnoses should be clearly and of course independently established, if possible by the use of psychological tests as well as clinical examination. Finally, the data should be analyzed from the standpoint of mean ratings, groups of somatotypes, and kinds and degree of dysplasia. Such a study, which would not be prohibitively difficult to carry out, would furnish the conclusive data which are so badly needed on the relationship between mental disease and physique.",

      "abstract": "The term sella (ESS) indicates the presence of an enlarged Sella turcica which contains a remodeled pituitary gland by pressing it against the back and lower wall of the sellar space. The condition is the result of the expansion of the subarachnoid space in the sella as a result of the incomplete continuity of the sellar diaphragm. There are two types of empty sella syndrome (ESS) with a difference in repercussions on the endocrine system. Therefore, with regard to etiology, empty Sella syndrome may be primary, if there is no pathological process in the selar region itself which is the cause of damage to the pituitary gland, or secondary, if it was caused by a specific pathological process. Primary empty sella syndrome (PESS) may be an incidental finding or can be registered with imaging methods of examination of patients presented with endocrine disorders, neurological symptoms, visual disturbances, etc. It may be caused by intracranial hypertension and/or selar diaphragm insufficiency in patients who have not previously documented any pathology of the pituitary gland. Secondary empty sella syndrome (SESS) is much more frequent and associated with various pathological conditions and processes of the selar region. The presence of intrasellar masses changes the normal anatomy of the diaphragm, stretching, enlarging and thining it, and increases the chances of developing arachnoid adhesions that can withdraw the SVS to the sellar cavity. Radiotherapy, surgery, medication therapy, infections, post-partum pituitary necrosis, trauma and spontaneous resolution may induce a reduction in the sellar mass and stimulate the emergence of secondary empty sella syndrome associated with the development of scar tissue tissues, which after a few months of retraction can pull the supraselar structures causing visual deficits. The disease is treated appropriately to the disorder-medical therapy of endocrine disorders, surgical excision of intrasellar masses and adhesions and reduction of intracranial pressure.",

The comorbidity of medical conditions and bipolar affective disorders is a topic that warrants systematic research. Rapid cycling has been reported in various other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as head injury, stroke, learning disability, or rarer illnesses, such as cerebral sarcoidosis or tuberous sclerosis. Rapid-cycling bipolar affective disorders may concur with higher rates of substance-abuse disorders, but such an idea is mainly based on clinical observation or preliminary data. There is an overall tendency that mixed states and rapid-cycling forms of bipolar affective disorder constitute more unfavorable forms of the underlying illness. Mixed affective episodes have a link with anxiety disorders and anxious-dependent personality disorders. Rapid cycling may have a link with substance abuse and with certain neuropsychiatric disorders, or, perhaps, these neuropsychiatric disorders may mimic rapid cycling.",

      "title": "Fatigue after Depression Responds to Therapy: What Are the Next Steps? A Sufficient Base of Evidence Is Often Lacking to Guide Pharmacotherapy for Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Fatigue and depression can be viewed as a vicious cycle: Fatigue can be a symptom of major depression, and fatigue can be a risk factor for depression. (1) For example, fatigue associated with a general medical condition or traumatic brain injury can be a risk factor for developing major depressive disorder (MDD). (1-3) It isn't surprising that fatigue has been studied as a predictor of relapse after previous response to treatment in patients with MDD. Despite the observed association between fatigue and depression, their underlying relationship often is unclear. The literature does not differentiate among fatigue associated with depression, fatigue as a treatment-emergent adverse effect, and fatigue as a residual symptom of depression that is partially responsive to treatment. (4,5) To complicate the situation, many medications used to treat MDD can cause fatigue. Patients often describe fatigue as (1) feeling tired, exhausted, or drained and (2) lacking energy and motivation. Fatigue can be related to impaired wakefulness but is believed to be a different entity than sleepiness. (6) Residual fatigue can affect social, cognitive, emotional, and physical health. We reviewed the literature about fatigue as a symptom of MDD by conducting a search of Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar, using keywords depression, fatigue, residual symptoms, and treatment. We chose the papers cited in this article based on our consensus and because these publications represent expert opinion or the highest quality evidence available. Residual fatigue has an effect on prognosis Fatigue is a common symptom of MDD that persists in 20% to 30% of patients whose symptoms of depression otherwise remit. (4,7-9) Several studies have linked residual fatigue with the overall prognosis of MDD. (5) Data from a prospective study demonstrate that depressed patients have a higher risk of relapse when they continue to report symptoms of fatigue after their symptoms of depression have otherwise entered partial remission. (10) Another study demonstrated that the severity of residual symptoms of depression is a strong predictor of another major depressive episode. (11) In a large-scale study the prevalence of residual fatigue after adequate treatment of MDD in both partial responders and remitters was 84.6%. (12) The same study showed that one-third of patients who had been treated for MDD had persistent and clinically significant fatigue, which could suggest a relationship between fatigue and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants. Another study demonstrated that 64.6% of patients who responded to antidepressant treatment and who had baseline fatigue continued to exhibit symptoms of fatigue after an adequate trial of an antidepressant. (13) Neurobiological considerations Studies have shown that the neuronal circuits that malfunction in fatigue are different from those that malfunction in depression. (14) Although the neurobiology of fatigue has not been determined, decreased neuronal activity in the prefrontal circuits has been associated with symptoms of fatigue. (15) In addition, evidence from the literature shows a decrease in hormone secretion (16) and cognitive abilities in patients exhibiting symptoms of fatigue. (17) These findings have led some experts to hypothesize that symptoms of fatigue associated with depression could be the result of (1) immune dysregulation (18) and (2) an inability of available antidepressants to target the underlying biology of the disorder. (2) Despite the hypothesis that fatigue associated with depression might be biologically related to immune dysregulation, some authors continue to point to an imbalance in neurotransmitters--norepinephrine, histamine, dopamine, acetylcholine--as being associated with fatigue. (14) For example, a study demonstrated that drugs targeting noradrenergic reuptake inhibition were more effective at preventing a relapse of fatigue compared with serotonergic drugs. …",

      "abstract": "Sleep Disorders in Old Age Abstract. Sleep disorders increase with age. Older patients rarely complain about sleep disorders, therefore it is important to ask about sleep problems. Insomnias, sleep-disordered breathing and restless legs syndrome tend to increase with older age. It is important to consider that sleep disorders may be the first symptom of a depression, anxiety disorder or neurodegenerative disorders such as dementias. Many factors can influence sleep in old age: it is important to inquire after sleeping habits including naps during the day, medication and comorbidity. Treatment depends on the causes. Insomnias should be treated mainly with non-pharmacological means such as cognitive behaviour therapy.Zusammenfassung. Schlafstörungen im Alter sind häufig und haben unterschiedliche Ursachen. Ältere Leute beklagen sich selten darüber, daher muss immer danach gefragt werden. Insomnien, schlafassoziierte Atemstörungen und das Restless-Legs-Syndrom nehmen im Alter zu. Nicht selten sind Schlafstörungen auch erstes Symptom anderer Erkrankungen. Bei Depressionen oder Angsterkrankungen, aber auch bei neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen wie Demenzen oder dem Parkinsonsyndrom können sich Schlafstörungen vor kognitiven Störungen oder motorischen Beschwerden manifestieren. Schlafstörungen können auch Risikofaktor für andere Erkrankungen sein, wie zerebrale Ischämien und Herzrhythmusstörungen. Vieles muss bei der Diagnostik und Therapie berücksichtigt werden: Schlafgewohnheiten nachts und tagsüber, Medikamente und Begleiterkrankungen. Die Behandlung ist abhängig von der Ursache und sollte vor allem bei den Insomnien nicht-medikamentöse Therapien wie kognitive Verhaltenstherapie beinhalten.",

      "title": "Disability and mental illness are different entities and should be assessed separately",
      "abstract": "The acceptance of the conceptual position presented by Üstün and Kennedy is of great importance for psychiatry and for medicine as a whole. Disability — whether defined as a functional impairment in terms of the DSM-IV or as a limitation of an individual's activities as is done in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 1 — must be assessed separately and not as a part of the individual's mental illness. It would be wrong to make the diagnosis dependent on the presence or absence of disability. Disability is produced by mental disorder, but it also depends on simultaneously present comorbid diseases or impairments. The latter is becoming a consideration of growing importance. A significant proportion of people with mental illness also suffer from physical illnesses and it is therefore difficult if not impossible to assess to what an extent the disability is caused by the mental disorder and to what extent it is produced by the comorbid conditions. Disability must refer to the person who suffers from a disease (or diseases), lives in a particular setting, receives a particular treatment and has personality traits that define the way in which he or she will live with a disease. Assets that a person with a disease might have — be it an artistic gift or access to wealth — will also affect the occurrence and severity of disability. The realization that the disability is linked to the person and not to the disease is of significance in developing rehabilitation services, in assessing the levels of support that society will offer to the disabled person and in determining what treatment can be offered if a disease occurs. Psychopathological findings define diagnosis but must be complemented by other assessments if they are to help in the estimation of \"caseness\" relevant to the provision of services or the estimation of needs for them. \"Caseness\" will be defined taking into account the psycho-pathological findings, the disability and the distress that the individual presents and relates to his or her medical/psychiatric condition. Persons with a particular psychiatric diagnosis can become \"cases\" for the mental health services when their disability is more pronounced (e.g., because of changes of the environment) or when their distress is enhanced (e.g., by learning about the prognosis of their condition). In clinical work and for research purposes, the assessment of the presence of a disorder, of disability and of distress must be accompanied by an estimate of their severity. The severity of the disease is usually assessed with reference to the numbers and the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, the severity of disability by the type and number of activities in which the individual cannot take part, and the severity of distress on the basis of analogy with states that the distressed individual and the diagnostician both know and have experienced. Severity can be measured as a dimension or as a feature that divides into several operationally defined categories. The same is true for disability and for distress, but not for the psychopathological symptoms, which must have features that make them recognizable as being qualitatively different from normal functioning. Severity of distress and severity of disability are usually correlated with the severity of the clinical syndrome, but this is not always the case. Distress might be linked to the vision of the future rather than to the level of disability or the severity of the clinical condition. The possibility that a black wart might be a melanoma will cause great distress although there are no limitations of activity and no certainty that the wart contains cells that are malignant or that it will be growing rapidly. The severity of disability might be linked to the severity of the clinical picture, but this is also not so for most of the time a person has a disease — with the exception of the most severe states of the disorder, for example in profound dementia or in a coma. People with a variety of psychopathological symptoms are often living in their community, with little or no limitation of their activity. The usefulness of the framework presented above for research purposes depends on the possibility of measuring syndromes, disability, distress and their severity in reliable and valid ways. The development of instruments that will help researchers to do this is clearly a major challenge for the ICD and the DSM committees. The usefulness of the same framework for clinical practice will depend on making the need for these measurements explicit and on training practitioners in making the necessary assessments. Practitioners have used the four dimensions mentioned above in dealing with people who came to ask for their help ever since medicine has been invented. A study of the way in which clinicians are operating may give precious information about their methods of assessment, which, when combined with results of research using valid and reliable assessment instruments, might allow the creation of training programmes that will make the classification of diseases accepted and used as a basis for research and for practice.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness, with symptoms beginning in late adolescence/early adulthood and persisting throughout the rest of the patient's life. Positive psychotic symptoms may fluctuate during the course of the illness, but negative symptoms, especially primary negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction are relatively constant. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are both primary (associated with the illness) and secondary (due to depression, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism or acute psychosis). While secondary negative symptoms may be reduced by treating the causative agent, primary negative symptoms are viewed as enduring, persisting between psychotic episodes. Conventional antipsychotics treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but they have little effect on primary negative and cognitive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are often associated with poor premorbid function, the male sex, and low IQ (Intelligence Quotient). In addition, most studies find that negative symptoms are associated with a poor overall outcome. Several studies, including our own, have suggested that primary negative symptoms are functionally localized to the frontal and parietal cortices. These kinds of data raise the possibility that primary negative symptoms may have a pathophysiological basis distinct from positive psychosis. Cognitive impairment also appears to be a relatively independent aspect of schizophrenia. Impairment may be evident in a subtle form from early childhood, and often precedes the development of psychotic symptoms. Additional impairment accrues with the onset of psychotic illness with little evidence, in the vast majority of cases, of progression over the course of the illness. Cognitive impairment is only modestly related to psychotic symptom severity and type. However, the extent, and perhaps specific types of cognitive impairment, appear to be predictive of functional outcome.",

      "title": "Alteraciones cognitivas y lingüísticas en la enfermedad de Parkison",
      "abstract": "La Enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es una enfermedad neurodegenerativa caracterizada principalmente por sintomas motores (rigidez, bradicinesia, temblor en reposo) que aparece por una perdida de dopamina en el circuito que conecta los ganglios basales con la corteza cerebral y por la aparicion de depositos de Lewy en diferentes regiones cerebrales. Aunque el origen de la EP es parcialmente desconocido, han sido descubiertos algunos genes que estan involucrados en su aparicion, pero que explican solamente un pequeno porcentaje de los casos. En las ultimas decadas, el interes por los sintomas no motores (SNM) de la enfermedad ha ido creciendo progresivamente. El deterioro cognitivo leve (DCL) es uno de estos sintomas que puede aparecer incluso desde los inicios de la enfermedad y en algunos casos, evolucionar hasta la demencia. El perfil cognitivo de estos pacientes suele caracterizarse por dificultades ejecutivas, aunque tambien es frecuente encontrar deficits de memoria, de habilidades visuoespaciales, de procesamiento emocional y del lenguaje.En el caso del lenguaje, las alteraciones pueden afectar tanto al procesamiento de mas alto nivel como la pragmatica o la comprension de oraciones, hasta el procesamiento lexico-semantico. Sin embargo, aun hay controversia acerca del origen de estos deficits. Diferentes estudios han tratado de conocer si el deficit es puramente linguistico o si por el contrario es secundario a las alteraciones cognitivas presentes en los pacientes, o incluso si existe relacion con el trastorno motor y/o los niveles de dopamina cerebral.El objetivo principal de esta Tesis es conocer el perfil cognitivo de un grupo de pacientes con EP sin demencia asi como las alteraciones linguisticas que pueden presentar, principalmente de los verbos.La hipotesis de partida es que los pacientes con EP muestran deficits cognitivos y en el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales en ausencia de demencia objetivados con pruebas neuropsicologicas. En cuanto a los trastornos del lenguaje, la hipotesis principal de este trabajo es que los pacientes con EP sin demencia presentan deficits linguisticos en el procesamiento de los verbos que aumentan con la retirada de la medicacion dopaminergica. Para poner a prueba estas hipotesis, llevamos a cabo 5 estudios distintos. En el primer trabajo participaron 50 pacientes con EP y 42 controles sanos. En el segundo, 40 pacientes con EP y 19 controles, en ambos, los pacientes fueron evaluados con una extensa bateria neuropsicologica y en el segundo se incluyeron mas tareas linguisticas y una de reconocimiento de expresiones faciales. En el tercer estudio, una muestra de 49 pacientes con EP y 19 controles realizaron una tarea de denominacion de acciones en la que se controlo el contenido motor de los dibujos que tenian que denominar. En los experimentos cuatro y cinco, 20 pacientes fueron evaluados con la misma tarea de denominacion de acciones (estudio cuatro) y con cuatro tareas de fluidez verbal (estudio cinco), mientras estaban con y sin los efectos de la medicacion dopaminergica.Los resultados encontrados han sido publicados en cinco articulos y pueden resumirse de la siguiente manera:En el primer articulo (Rodriguez-Ferreiro, Cuetos, Herrera, Menendez & Ribacoba, 2010) se encontro que la muestra con EP sin demencia presentaba dificultades en tareas que evaluaban funciones ejecutivas, atencion, orientacion temporal, memoria inmediata, fluidez semantica, denominacion de personajes famosos y denominacion de acciones. En el segundo articulo (Herrera, Cuetos & Rodriguez-Ferreiro, 2011), encontramos diferencias significativas en la fluidez semantica, la fluidez de acciones, la denominacion de acciones, la denominacion de personajes famosos, la atencion y el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales. Los analisis de regresion mostraron que la tarea de reconocimiento de expresiones era la que mejor diferenciaba entre el grupo de EP y el grupo control. Ademas la distribucion de este deficit era similar tanto para los pacientes con DCL como para los pacientes con funciones cognitivas normales. Centrandonos en las alteraciones del lenguaje, en el tercer articulo (Herrera, Rodriguez-Ferreiro & Cuetos, 2012) se observo que los pacientes cometen mas errores a la hora de denominar dibujos que tienen un alto contenido motor en comparacion con aquellos de bajo contenido motor, mientras que los controles tenian un rendimiento similar en ambas categorias. Los resultados del cuarto articulo con pacientes con y sin medicacion (Herrera & Cuetos, 2012), mostraron que mientras en los pacientes con medicacion, los tiempos de reaccion (TR) eran similares para ambos tipos de dibujos, en los EP off, los TR eran significativamente mas lentos para los dibujos con un alto contenido motor. Por ultimo, los resultados obtenidos en el quinto estudio (Herrera, Cuetos & Ribacoba, 2012) muestran que los pacientes off medicacion generan significativamente menos palabras en las tareas que dependen de las zonas frontales (fluidez fonologica y de acciones). Y lo mas interesante es que en el caso de la fluidez de acciones, los pacientes off medicacion generaron verbos significativamente mas frecuentes que en on o que los generados por el grupo control.Los resultados sugieren que es posible encontrar deficits cognitivos en pacientes con EP sin demencia o quejas subjetivas de deterioro en los estadios iniciales de la enfermedad. Ademas estas dificultades no solo se relacionan con las tareas ejecutivas, sino que tambien aparecen problemas semanticos. Aparte de los deficits cognitivos, es posible encontrar problemas relacionados con el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales, independientes a la presencia de DCL.En cuanto a los trastornos linguisticos, los EP muestran un deficit especifico en el procesamiento de los verbos evaluado tanto con tareas de denominacion de acciones como de fluidez verbal. En el caso de la denominacion de acciones, el deficit parece tener un origen semantico, pues las dificultades aumentan al denominar acciones con mayor contenido motor que es mas acusado en los pacientes en los que el trastorno motor es mas severo (cuando estan sin medicacion). Estos datos sugieren que las mismas areas encargadas de planificar y ejecutar los movimientos estan implicadas, al menos en parte, en el procesamiento de los verbos de accion. Ademas la dopamina tambien parece jugar un papel importante en la activacion del sistema lexico-semantico de los verbos, pues cuando los pacientes se encuentran sin los efectos de la medicacion, solo pueden acceder a aquellos verbos que tienen mayor frecuencia lexica y por tanto estan mas accesibles.En definitiva, los resultados presentados muestran que los pacientes con EP sin demencia, presentan deficits cognitivos, de reconocimiento de expresiones faciales y dificultades relacionadas con el procesamiento de los verbos.",

      "abstract": "Sjukfrånvaro i psykiatriska diagnoser ökar. Trots detta är nivåerna låga i jämförelse med hur vanliga psykiska sjukdomar som depressioner, ångestsjukdomar, alkoholmissbruk och psykoser är i befolkningen. Den psykiatriska sjukfrånvaron är en underskattning av det verk­liga sambandet mellan psykisk ohälsa och nedsatt arbetsförmåga. Epidemiologisk forskning av sjukfrånvaro bland kvinnor med psykiska problem visar att de har fler sjukfall och sjuk­ dagar än kvinnor utan psykiska problem. Detta gäller särskilt sjukfrånvaro i rörelseorganens sjukdomar. Det finns också intressanta könsskillnader när det gäller den psykiatriska sjuk­frånvaron. Kvinnor är oftare sjukskrivna, medan männen har längre sjukfall. Får kvinnor sämre behandling, vilket leder till att de på nytt blir sjukskrivna? Eller är det helt enkelt svårare för män att återgå till arbetet efter en sjukskrivningsperiod för psykisk sjukdom på grund av den traditionella mansrollen, där män förväntas vara \"starka\"? Både kvinnor och män som arbetar i extremt mans- respektive kvinnodominerade yrkesgrupper har förhöjd psykiatrisk sjukfrån­varo, vilket kan bero på ökade prestationskrav och svagare socialt stöd för könet i minoritet på arbetsplatsen",

      "title": "Mixed dementia and hyperactive delirium: a diagnostic challenge",
      "abstract": "It is well recognised that acute confusion or delirium complicates up to 10% of acute medical admissions. Disorientation in time and place with an impaired short-term memory and conscious level are the hallmarks of an acute confusion. In delirium, disorders of perception may produce restlessness and agitation. A similar state during the final days of life is termed ‘terminal delirium’. Less than 10% of affected individuals will have a primary neurological disorder, for example, dementia, a neurodegenerative disease with varying aetiologies. Currently there are at least 50 million people globally suffering from dementia rendering it a global healthcare problem. Mixed dementia (MD) can be defined as a cognitive decline sufficient to impair independent functioning in daily life resulting from the coexistence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cerebrovascular pathology. MD occurs in patients with a neurodegenerative disorder, such as AD, Lewy body or Pick’s disease and additionally cerebrovascular disease. The mechanistic synergisms between the coexisting pathologies affecting dementia risk, progression and the ultimate clinical manifestations remain elusive. Although AD can be diagnosed with a considerable degree of accuracy, the distinction between isolated AD, vascular dementia and MD, when both pathologies coexist in the same patient remains one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges because their clinical presentation can overlap. Neuropathological studies indicate that mixed vascular Alzheimer’s dementia (MD) has a prevalence of 22% in the elderly. The authors present the case of a 78-year-old man with a diagnosis of MD presenting to the emergency department with delirium, a common but serious acute neuropsychiatric syndrome with the core features of inattention and global cognitive dysfunction. This case demonstrates the challenges in establishing a diagnosis in patients presenting with MD and shows that a cognitive assessment at presentation in a delirious state offers very little diagnostic information. It is therefore suggested to conduct a routine cognitive function examination on patients with dementia to anticipate new neurological signs and/or symptoms thus allowing earlier diagnosis and treatment. However, a baseline cognitive assessment when the patient was well, duration and nature of deterioration as well as collateral history will help differentiate delirium from an underlying dementia.",

La neurosarcoidose a manifestations psychiatriques est rare et inhabituelle. Les symptomes psychiatriques sont tres heterogenes ; ils peuvent etre sous forme de trouble de l’humeur, syndrome delirant, tableau de psychose ou bien des agitations psychomotrices.Nous rapportons ici le cas d’un patient, âge de 45 ans, chez qui le diagnostic d’un trouble schizo-affectif a ete retenu. La symptomatologie psychiatrique etait dominee par l’hetero-agressivite et les rechutes frequentes malgre un traitement a base d’antipsychotique bien conduit (moins d’effets secondaires par rapport au traitement par neuroleptiques classiques) [1] et une bonne observance therapeutique. Son humeur depressive a ete compliquee de plusieurs tentatives de suicides. Apres 20 ans d’evolution, le patient a presente une sarcoidose multi systemique ; cutanee et pulmonaire. Devant ce tableau clinique, nous avons avance l’hypothese d’une eventuelle liaison entre la symptomatologie psychiatrique et la sarcoidose. Le diagnostic de neurosarcoidose est probable selon la classification de Zajicek.

      "abstract": "Psychological changes or rather the recovery from psycho-somatic diseases at old age can point out a chronic failure of solutions. This means that in the course of their individual life people have not found satisfying solutions for conflicts and identity endangering stress. The result of such a process often means an advancement of diseases in old age. This is the reason why it is very important-especially for aged and/or care-needing people-that concepts are developed in the field of geriatric nursing that provide solutions for life that has been \"misunderstood\". But the old-peoples-care, which is oriented one-sidedly on physical deficiency, prevents the process of reconciling with lived and not lived life. The consequence is that certain forms of diseases in correspondence with changes in behavior leading to aggression, apathy, depression etc. are supposedly (medically) \"cured\" or \"stagnated\" by the use of neuroleptica. The possibility of a self-responsible, positive life-mastering is suppressed. The questions for the causes of psychological changes at old age remain unasked, and they are simply called \"mental and physical stagnation caused by old-age\". In practice, this means that the geriatric system rather supports illness than health and self-determination at old age.",

For the differential diagnosis, history and other symptoms are important such as hemiplegia, signs of brain stem dysfunction, meningism or headache. Metabolic, endocrinologic, toxicologic or electrolytic causes of coma usually can be diagnosed by laboratory examinations. Anamnestic informations, body inspection, clinical neurological examination as well as laboratory and imaging findings have to be added and categorized by a multilevel composition to establish a conclusive diagnosis. Simultaneously therapeutic measures for suspected primary cerebral diseases must be initiated, for example a rapid antibiotic treatment in case of a possible bacterial meningitis. A fast and structured diagnostic approach is crucial for ensuring a good prognosis and helps to miss relevant diagnostic steps. Potential diagnostic and therapeutic pitfalls must be kept in mind.",

Lewy body dementias are most common, encompassing Parkinson disease (PD) with dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, which share the common pathologic substrate of intracellular neuronal inclusion bodies that contain α-synuclein. Multiple system atrophies (MSAs), which are now divided into parkinsonian and cerebellar subtypes, are related disorders with core features that include autonomic and parkinsonian motor signs and α-synuclein-containing glial intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration are parkinsonian dementias that superficially resemble PD and MSA in terms of motor features, but are distinguished pathologically by neurofibrillary tau protein abnormalities. Some other causes of dementia associated with parkinsonism include drug-induced parkinsonism, vascular parkinsonism, normal pressure hydrocephalus, prion diseases including Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (see the chapter \"Rapidly Progressing Dementias\"), Alzheimer disease with extrapyramidal signs (see the chapter \"Alzheimer Disease Update\"), and metabolic derangements that have a predilection for basal ganglia structures.

      "title": "Professional neuroses",
      "abstract": "Neuroses are a group of neuropsychiatric disorders that are based on reversible disorders of the nervous system, which arise as a result of acute or chronic psychological overstrain. Neuroses are one of the most widespread neuropsychiatric diseases in the world. At the present stage, they are also distinguished as an occupational disease in accordance with the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The etiological factor in the development of neuroses is a single or prolonged exposure to mental traumas that carry negative or problematic information. The strength of the impact on the psyche is determined not by the physical intensity of the signal, but by the significance of the information. The main factor contributing to the development of the disease is the individual psychophysical characteristics of a particular person. The symptoms of neuroses are divided into two main groups: somatic and psychopathic. Symptoms of neurosis are always present for a long time. They are often painfully perceived not only by the patient, but also their environment, thereby impairing the quality of life of many people both in everyday life and in production conditions. The main clinical forms of neuroses are neurasthenia, hysterical neurosis and obsessional neurosis. The diagnosis of neuroses is based on data from the clinical picture, occupational history, professional journey and additional examination methods that allow you to exclude somatic pathology. Neuroses are easier to prevent than to treat, so their prevention is of great importance. The main areas of neuroses treatment are psychotherapy and other non-drug and drug therapies. Working capacity in neuroses largely depends on the patient’s interest in continuing their work. Determining the degree of disability also depends on the severity of the pathological process.",

      "abstract": "Global hypoactivity contrasting with apparently unaffected cognitive abilities was initially reported in cases of frontal damage and is now recognized as a leading behavioral feature of many cerebral diseases. Of the various terms used to refer to this behavioral change, \"apathy\" is now the most widely used. Global hypoactivity with apathy is easy to diagnose in patients without other obvious neuropsychiatric impairments. In other clinical contexts, the diagnosis of global hypoactivity with apathy requires the physician to first establish that hypoactivity and loss of motivation cannot be more readily explained by sensorimotor impairments (e.g., as observed in patients with stroke or Parkinson's disease) or cognitive impairments (e.g., as observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease). Many criteria and behavioral scales have been used to diagnose hypoactivity with apathy. The main differential diagnosis is depression and depressive symptoms, and distinguishing between these conditions and apathy may be particularly challenging. The mechanisms of hypoactivity with apathy remain uncertain and probably involve several dysfunctions, including the inability to attach motivational values to stimuli. We reviewed the frequency, characteristics, and determinants of hypoactivity with apathy in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, across the different stages of cognitive compromise. The diagnosis of this condition is an important step in identifying the source of difficulties in patients' activities of daily living.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In accordance with the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Chapter 18, Pain, pain that is attributable to mental illness does not also qualify for an additional pain-related evaluation. Evaluators must discriminate between presentations of pain that represent mental illness vs those that do not and must decide whether to rate using Chapter 18 or 14. Dichotomous thinking often opposes the notion of psychological vs physiological-organic presentations, but all presentations of pain include psychological aspects, and all mental illnesses include physiological aspects. One type of illustrative mental illness involves conditions that are overtly mental but have been found via extensive scientific study to have a physiological basis (eg, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease). Another presentation that is claimed to be of a medical nature actually overlaps with psychological issues (eg, complex regional pain syndrome, type 1 [CRPS-1] and fibromyalgia). Further, the AMA Guides summarizes the lack of a strong correlation between tissue damage or physiology and pain: Pain can exist without tissue damage, and tissue damage can exist without pain. Pain, chronic pain, and impairment from pain are largely, even primarily, psychological phenomena. Accordingly, the determination whether to rely on the pain chapter or the mental/behavioral chapter in the evaluation of a pain presentation cannot be reduced to a misleading dichotomy of psychological vs organic pain.",

These disorders reflect pathological processes in the central nervous system and are an important predictor of the social functioning recovery of patients. The question of the deficit structure remains open. In some cases, cognitive impairments are detected in early school age, in others, they appear only in adolescence. At the disease onset, there is a sharp deterioration in cognitive functioning. Further change is also heterogeneous: the same cognitive functions can either remain stable, or deteriorate or improve. To further study the cognitive deficit, it is necessary to distinguish more homogeneous groups based on both clinical parameters, and on the results of performing cognitive tests. It is important for the future of the concept of cognitive deficit to correlate it with the usual conceptualizations, including pathopsychological symptom groups.",

      "title": "Aspectos neurobiológicos de los síndromes esquizofrénicos",
      "abstract": "Existen diferentes criterios diagnosticos de los sindromes esquizofrenicos. Los mas citados en la literatura psiquiatrica contemporanea son los de investigacion de Feighner, el DSM III, y el criterio de la OMS. En algunos casos, los sindromes esquizofrenicos tienen caracteristicas clinicas parecidas a las de otras patologias organicas cuyas etiologias son diferentes. Contrariamente a lo que se ha pensado, los sindromes esquizofrenicos cursan en algunos casos con patologias estructurales tales como atrofia cortical, dilatacion ventricular o anormalidades del cuerpo calloso y del vermis cerebeloso. Tambien se han reportado anormalidades en los potenciales evocados auditivos y en los electroencefalogramas de algunos casos de esquizofrenia. Las anormalidades reportadas en electronistagmogramas de movimientos oculares de seguimiento suave sugieren que hay alteraciones en las vias inhibitorias de la atencion involuntaria central. Los estudios con tomografia por emision de positrones tambien sugieren que hay alteraciones en el metabolismo de la glucosa en algunos pacientes. La hipotesis de que la esquizofrenia pudiera deberse a la sobreactividad de los circuitos centrales dopaminicos no ha podido demostrarse, pues algunos estudios comprueban que hay un aumento en los receptores de dopamina, mientras que otros lo relacionan con un tratamiento prolongado por neurolepticos. Se han reportado alteraciones hormonales asi como en el mecanismo de otros neurotrasmisores centrales (serotonina, noradrenalina, etc.) Sin embargo, estos hallazgos han sido rebatidos o reportados como negativos por otros investigadores. Lo mismo sucede con los estudios de enzimas involucradas en procesos metabolicos del sistema nervioso central (MAO, beta hidroxilasa de la dopamina, etc.). Hay otros estudios que reportan la existencia de inmunoglobulinas anormales y de linfocitos atipicos (estimulados) en los pacientes esquizofrenicos. Es probable que un subgrupo de esquizofrenicos padezca de alteraciones inmunologicas, y que, incluso, produzcan anticuerpos contra las estructuras neuronales. Tambien las anormalidades inmunologicas puede ser una respuesta a alguna invasion del sistema nervioso central por virus lentos. Es probable que durante el desarrollo infantil los procesos psicologicos interactuen con las predisposiciones biologicas y posiblemente geneticas en ciertos individuos, lo que daria por resultado las manifestaciones clinicas de la esquizofrenia. Seria importante no diagnosticar a los pacientes psiquiatricos antes de explorar y eliminar otras patologias curables que pudieran ser responsables de la sintomatologia. El concepto nosologico de esquizofrenia no esta claramente delimitado, y tampoco hay un acuerdo universal sobre lo que incluiria a un nivel descriptivo. Aspectos Epidemiologicos: Fuera de los Estados Unidos, se reporta una prevalencia del 0.2% a casi el 1%. Algunos reportes americanos informan de una frecuencia entre 0.23% y 0.47%. Las diferencias podrian deberse a las dificultades que se han tenido para diagnosticar o localizar a los pacientes (areas rurales), o a los diferentes criterios que se han utilizado. La expectativa de vida de estos pacientes es inferior a la de la poblacion en general, debido a las altas tasas de suicidio, al bajo nivel socioeconomico y al deterioro psicobiologico causado por la institucionalizacion prolongada. Se reporta una incidencia que va desde 4.3 casos nuevos por cada 10 000 a 6.9 por cada 10 000. En Estados Unidos, una de cada dos camas de los hospitales psiquiatricos esta ocupada por esquizofrenicos, y estos comprenden aproximadamente el 32% de las admisiones nuevas. La prevalencia en la poblacion hospitalaria de Mexico es superior al 50%. Segun el experto en esquizofrenia, Mosher, el costo aproximado por incapacidad laboral y cuidados medicos y psiquiatricos se elevo a 15 000 millones de dolares a principios de la decada de los setenta solo en Estados Unidos.",

      "abstract": "More than 20 studies of schizophrenia have found a three-factor model of symptom complexes or syndromes consisting of hallucinations/delusions, disorganization of thought and behavior, and negative symptoms. Several lines of evidence suggest that these syndromes relate to neurobiological differences. We examined the relationship of these three syndromes to neurological signs.The relationships among the subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale and hallucinations/delusions, disorganization, and the deficit syndrome were examined in 83 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients with the deficit syndrome have enduring, idiopathic (or primary) negative symptoms.Each of the three syndromes had a distinctive pattern of relationships to neurological signs. Disorganization was significantly related to the total score on the Neurological Evaluation Scale, to sensory integration, and to the sequencing of complex motor acts. The deficit syndrome was significantly related to sensory integration only. Neither hallucinations/delusions nor a continuous measure of negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (that measured both primary and secondary negative symptoms, as well as enduring and transient symptoms) was related to any of the Neurological Evaluation Scale subscales or total score. Drug treatment was not related to neurological impairment.The results further support the neurobiological significance of the three clinical syndromes of schizophrenia. Ratings on a scale measuring negative symptoms appear to be less sensitive to neurobiological correlates than is the categorization of the presence or absence of the deficit syndrome.",

      "abstract": "The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) is a nosology; this means that it is a system of classification of diseases and disorders which primarily present mental and behavioral symptoms, although not exclusively (see, for instance, somatoform disorders), with independence of their etiology, most of them unknown. The DSM has, aside from other characteristics, a double sense; it is at the same time “the classification”, that is, the list of accepted diseases included under certain categories and “the system” for diagnosing them, or what is the same, the diagnostic mechanics of such disorders, which in this case is done through diagnostic criteria and a multiaxial system. The diagnostic criteria are basically the confirmation of the presence of behaviors and mental produce such as thoughts (deliria), personality traits (impulsivity), etc. It is based on the clinical detection of these phenomena in a descriptive manner and does not include etiological or etiopathogenic criteria simply because, beyond theories and models with more or less empirical or experimental basis, for most of the disorders included in the DSM, these are unknown. Furthermore, in some of those where a clear cerebral etiology is recognized, such as Alzheimer s type dementias, the complete etiopathogenic processes are unknown. The inclusion or not of a possible disorder and/or disease into the system, or its removal is carried out by a committee of experts who periodically makes revisions but not at fixed dates. This means that when a revision of the system or new edition is decided, committees of experts for the different categories are created who, after revising the scientific literature available in the period of time between two revisions, the different proposals made by institutions, and with the collaboration of the experts deemed necessary, make proposals which will or will not be accepted by the revision committee. The organization, on which the DSM depends and, therefore becomes its endorser, is the APA (American Psychiatric Association), and hence, the DSM reflects, to a great extent, the thought and dominant positions in the APA at any given moment. This organization is not the only source of influence on the manual. Since its third version in the nineteen-eighties, increasingly more efforts are being made to coordinate with the ICD system, which is the diagnostic coding system of diseases proposed, endorsed and used by the WHO (World Health Organization) and whose Chapter V is dedicated to mental and behavioral disorders. As a result, there is a more or less explicit aim that sooner or later a sole nosology in mental disorders with unique codes for each DSM, MENTAL HEALTH AND PARENTAL ALIENATION SYNDROME",

      "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading genetic cause of infantile death. SMA is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, leading to weakness and muscle atrophy. SMA occurs as a result of homozygous deletion or mutations in Survival Motor Neuron-1 (SMN1). Loss of SMN1 leads to a dramatic reduction in SMN protein, which is essential for motor neuron survival. SMA disease severity ranges from extremely severe to a relatively mild adult onset form of proximal muscle atrophy. Severe SMA patients typically die mostly within months or a few years as a consequence of respiratory insufficiency and bulbar paralysis. SMA is widely known as a motor neuron disease; however, there are numerous clinical reports indicating the involvement of additional peripheral organs contributing to the complete picture of the disease in severe cases. In this review, we have compiled clinical and experimental reports that demonstrate the association between the loss of SMN and peripheral organ deficiency and malfunction. Whether defective peripheral organs are a consequence of neuronal damage/muscle atrophy or a direct result of SMN loss will be discussed.",

The disorder is characterized by a pronounced memory loss, due to neuropathological changes in the mesial temporal lobes; as the pathology spreads throughout the cerebral cortex. However, it is still unknown why some areas are more affected than others, with the subsequent clinical heterogeneity (or phenotypes), and variability in the clinical course. The most salient neurobehavioral syndromes that can affect the clinical course are extrapyramidal signs, as well as a wide variety of psychiatric syndromes (e.g., psychotic symptoms, depression, aggression). Similarly, medication use (e.g., antipsychotics, sedatives) have shown to have a detrimental effect in the course of the disease. Current palliative treatments for AD may alter the natural history of the disease by extending the time that affected patients may live at home.",

Therefore, treatment for sleep disorders offers the chance to improve geriatric syndromes.When treating, it is important to identify the individual sleep disorders. Coincidences of different sleep disorders are common in the elderly. The history of a patient in connection with a sleeping diary is the basic diagnostic procedure. Sleep medicine provides further technical methods for further examination. Older people should also be examined in a sleep laboratory if the results have consequences that will be accepted by the patient. However, this should be clarified in advance.",

In addition to cognitive symptoms such as memory loss and language impairment, patients with AD often develop behavioral symptoms. While cognitive symptoms are required for the diagnosis of AD and are relentlessly progressive, behavioral symptoms are not inevitable, usually fluctuate in severity, and may be intermittent or transient. Before initiating treatment, the physician must determine whether physical illness, medications, or environmental or interpersonal factors are contributing to the behavioral symptoms. Elderly patients are more sensitive than younger adults to medication effects and side effects. The combination of aging and AD produces marked deficits of brain neurotransmitter systems, particularly acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Delusions and hallucinations occur most often in patients with AD who have mild to moderately severe dementia. Anxiety is relatively uncommon in patients with AD. Several classes of medications may be used, most of which can produce tolerance with long-term use.",

Some patients are responsive but have cognitive or other neurologic deficits; others are less responsive or even comatose. Increasingly, the diagnosis of NCSE is considered in intensive care unit patients. Here, without clinical signs of seizures such as convulsions, EEG is critical in diagnosis, but there is uncertainty about which EEG patterns represent seizures and which clinical situations and EEG patterns warrant aggressive treatment. Antiseizure medications are tailored to the NCSE type and the clinical condition. Treatment is often easier for NCSE, and the outcome better, than for convulsive SE, but this is not always true for critically ill patients with NCSE in the ICU, for whom continuous EEG monitoring is often crucial for diagnosis and management.",

Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

In a significant proportion of individuals, however, recovery may be impaired, leading to long-term pathological disturbances. The most common of these is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A range of other disorders may also be seen after trauma, and there is considerable overlap between PTSD symptoms and several other psychiatric conditions. Risk factors for PTSD include severe exposure to the trauma, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and a history of psychiatric illness. Although PTSD may resolve in the majority of cases, in some cases risk factors outweigh protective factors, and symptoms may persist for many years. PTSD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse, and with physical (somatization) symptoms. There is growing evidence that PTSD does not merely represent a normal response to stress, but rather is mediated by specific neurobiological dysfunctions.",

Easy life style, including physical activity, healthy dietary habits as well as good mental health are characterized by an efficient immune response. Life style is related to the type of occupational activity since work has a central part in life either as source of income or contributing to represent the social identity. Not only occupational stress, but also job loss or insecurity are thus considered serious stressful situations, inducing emotional disorders which may affect both neuroendocrine and immune systems; reduced reactivity to mitogens and/or decreased blood NK cytotoxic activity was reported in unemployed workers or in those with a high perception of job insecurity and/or job stress. Although genetic factors have a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, occupational stress (as in night shifts) was reported associated to an increased incidence of autoimmune disorders. Monitoring blood NK response may thus be included in the health programs as an indirect index of stressful job and/or poor lifestyle.",

It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

PD is associated with progressive loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, including various motor symptoms (e.g., bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor), as well as non-motor symptoms (e.g., cognitive impairment, constipation, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression). PD involves multiple biological processes, including mitochondrial or lysosomal dysfunction, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and neuroinflammation. Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a collection of numerous connected cerebral cardiovascular conditions, is a common and growing public health problem associated with many chronic diseases worldwide. MetS components include central/abdominal obesity, systemic hypertension, diabetes, and atherogenic dyslipidemia. MetS and PD share multiple pathophysiological processes, including insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. In recent years, MetS has been linked to an increased risk of PD, according to studies; however, the specific mechanism remains unclear. Researchers also found that some related metabolic therapies are potential therapeutic strategies to prevent and improve PD. This article reviews the epidemiological relationship between components of MetS and the risk of PD and discusses the potentially relevant mechanisms and recent progress of MetS as a risk factor for PD. Furthermore, we conclude that MetS-related therapies are beneficial for the prevention and treatment of PD.",

Este deterioro está presente en un 40 a 65% de los pacientes y afecta la velocidad de procesamiento de información, atención compleja, memoria de trabajo, memoria visual y verbal, fluencia verbal y funciones ejecutivas. Se puede presentar en el síndrome radiológico aislado, en el síndrome clínico aislado y en las diferentes fases de la enfermedad; además, es el responsable de la dependencia de algunos pacientes y de las dificultades para mantener o conseguir empleo. Este déficit cognitivo se asocia a atrofia del tálamo y se ha observado una correlación con las medidas de atrofia y con el volumen lesional cerebral. Existen diferentes herramientas para su evaluación; hay pruebas de cribado breves de 5 minutos de duración, hasta baterías extensas de 90 minutos. Respecto al tratamiento de las alteraciones cognitivas, no existe un tratamiento farmacológico específico; sin embargo, se considera que los fármacos modificadores de la enfermedad podrían tener una influencia favorable en la función cognitiva por sus efectos en la reducción de la actividad inflamatoria y la atrofia cerebral.

An organic background at the basal ganglia level has been suspected in the disease on the basis of anatomical, clinical and pharmacological findings. Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder have been studied from widely differing perspectives, one perspective has been that the syndrome reflects a dysfunction of the brain. Reports of obsessive-compulsive disorder in other brain diseases can be divided into three main categories: Basal ganglia disorders, Lesions of the posterior pituitary, producing diabetes insipidus, and Physical injuries to the brain. The clinical categories of brain disease which may give rise to obsessive-compulsive phenomena are various; there is no one clinical neurological condition which invariably gives rise to the pattern of psychiatric disorder.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Background : Miller Fisher Syndrome usually presents with complete ophthalmoplegia, areflexia and ataxia. We present an unusual case which presented with unilateral abducens nerve palsy. Case presentation : A 51 year old female patient presented with a history of difficulty in walking and double vision for 1 week which started 2 weeks following an episode of acute gastroenteritis. She didn’t have any bladder bowel incontinence or difficulty in breathing. On examination there was left side abducens nerve palsy and bilateral significant dysmetria. Upper limb and lower limb power was 4/5 with global areflexia. There was no fatigability or sensory deficit. Higher cortical functions were intact with Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15. Brain stem cerebro vascular accident, alcohol, toxin or drug mediated disease, myasthenia gravis, Bickerstaff encephalitis and Miller-Fisher syndrome were considered as possible differential diagnosis. There was no history of alcohol consumption or any exposure to drugs or toxins. Her Non contrast brain and MRI brain were normal. Nerve conduction study showed asymmetrical sensory motor and F wave abnormalities consistent with a Guillen-Barre Sydrome variant. Cerebro Spinal Fluid analysis showed albumino-cytological dissociation. These findings suggested the diagnosis of Miller-Fisher Syndrome. She was started on plasmaphareis. Her vital parameters, vital capacity and neurological deficit were closely monitored. With 5 cycles of plasmapharesis she made a complete neurological recovery and she was discharged on 16th day of admission. Conclusion: Miller Fisher Syndrome can present as unilateral abducens nerve palsy and early diagnosis and treatment leads to excellent functional outcome.",

Im klinischen Alltag treten häufig Mischformen mit begleitender Alzheimer-Erkrankung oder vaskulärer Enzephalopathie auf. Klinisch bedeutsam ist die Vorsicht bei der Anwendung neuroleptischer Substanzen bei älteren Personen mit demenzieller Symptomatik. Symptome, die im Erwachsenenalter gut auf eine neuroleptische Behandlung ansprechen, z. B. Wahn oder Halluzinationen, sind bei Patienten mit kognitiven Einschränkungen nur mit Vorsicht anzuwenden, da zumindest begleitend eine Neuroleptika-Empfindlichkeit in Assoziation zum Vorliegen von Lewy-Körpern bestehen kann.

      "abstract": "A person's well-being and health are greatly affected by disorders of sleep and wakefulness. It is of the utmost importance to diagnose and treat such conditions, since the associated daytime sleepiness is a major risk factor for accidents. Early establishment of the correct diagnosis paves the way to achieving an excellent therapeutic outcome. Health-economic requirements of appropriateness and necessity mandate the specific use of cost- and time-intensive examinations in the sleep laboratory. In accordance with the guidelines for \"non-restorative sleep\", severe and chronic sleep disorders can be diagnosed outside the sleep lab if the underlying cause can already be identified on the basis of the patient's history. Such is usually the case in sleep disorders caused by external influences, disturbed circadian rhythm or pre-existing neurological, psychiatric or internal disorders. Standardized questionnaires are used to record and evaluate the patient's complaints, and vigilance testing to assess impaired sustained attention during the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness is quantified by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In the case of some disorders such as apnoea, or periodic leg movements, simplified ambulatory methods have been developed to enable their detection at an early stage. The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep disorders in the sleep lab is cardiorespiratory polysomnography. The relevant biosignals for the assessment of sleep, respiration, heart function, the cardiovascular system and movement are well established. Some of the sensors employed need further improvement. Numerous methods for signal analysis are still undergoing development, and currently available automatic evaluation systems are not yet reliable enough to obviate the need for manual interpretation.",

      "abstract": "The neurologic dysfunction underlying epilepsy can predispose patients to psychiatric disorders, and the incidence of both depression and psychosis is increased in people with epilepsy. Depressive disorders are the most frequently recognized psychiatric comorbidities in people with epilepsy, but depression in children can be particularly difficult to recognize. Clinicians need to inquire about not only classic symptoms of depression such as anhedonia but also less obvious symptoms such as unprovoked irritability, unsubstantiated complaints of lack of love from family members, somatic complaints, and problems with concentration and poor school performance. The diagnosis of depressive disorders in children with epilepsy and mental retardation is even more difficult. Physicians need to be alert for the presence of iatrogenic depression, which may result from antiepileptic drugs or epilepsy surgery. People with epilepsy are also at increased risk for psychosis, which can be interictal, postictal, or (rarely) an expression of ictal activity. This psychosis can be related to seizure remission (ie, alternative psychosis) or iatrogenic (eg, related to antiepileptic drugs or following temporal lobectomy). Although both antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs have the potential to lower the seizure threshold and increase seizures, careful drug selection, dosing, and slow titration can minimize this risk, allowing treatment to proceed.

      "title": "El ejercicio físico voluntario como terapia para la enfermedad de Alzheimer: Estudio en ratones tripletransgénicos 3xTg-AD",
      "abstract": "La enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) es una patologia neurodegenerativa, progresiva y compleja que fue descrita por primera vez hace mas de 100 anos. Esta considerada dentro del grupo de las demencias, siendo de estas la mas frecuente (Lopez-Pousa et al., 1999). Clinicamente la enfermedad se presenta con la perdida progresiva de la memoria de corto alcance y a medida que avanza se produce la perdida de la memoria de larga duracion y el pensamiento abstracto. En la etapa mas tardia de la enfermedad los pacientes se vuelven confusos y pierden la orientacion del lugar y del tiempo. Estas manifestaciones clinicas son el resultado de una serie de cambios moleculares que se producen en el cerebro del paciente, relacionados con varias alteraciones histopatologicas que incluyen dos lesiones principales, las placas seniles extraneuronales y los ovillos neurofibrilares (ONF) (Selkoe, 2001). Se produce una degeneracion de las neuronas involucradas en los procesos de la memoria, que incluye la muerte selectiva de algunas celulas nerviosas, la perdida de sinapsis y la disminucion en los niveles de determinados neurotransmisores (DeKosky and Scheff, 1990; Scheff et al., 1991; Masliah et al., 2001).En el estudio patologico de los cerebros de los pacientes de la EA podemos observar un tamano medio mas pequeno que el de las personas sanas, atrofia cortical simetrica con afectacion de todos los lobulos, atrofia del lobulo temporal medio y afectacion de las areas de asociacion con respecto a las areas motoras y sensoriales (Hof et al., 1990). Las estructuras subcorticales se hallan normalmente conservadas, excepto la amigdala que se encuentra gravemente afectada.Desde el descubrimiento de la EA y hasta nuestros dias muchos han sido las investigaciones realizadas con el objetivo de comprender el proceso de esta enfermedad; asi como en la busqueda de un tratamiento efectivo para cortar el curso de la misma. Si bien es cierto que mucho se ha avanzado en la comprension bioquimica, molecular y clinica de la EA, mejorando en un alto grado la calidad de vida de los pacientes, no se ha podido encontrar un tratamiento que sea lo suficientemente efectivo para parar el avance progresivo de esta patologia.En los ultimos anos ha tomado fuerza el tratamiento de la enfermedad mediante tecnicas de intervencion conductual que pueden afectar beneficiosamente la salud cerebral y general del organismo, como el ejercicio fisico (EF) y el enriquecimiento ambiental. Para empezar, diversos estudios en modelos animales revelan las ventajas del EF sobre la salud y la funcion cerebral, muestran los efectos beneficiosos del inicio temprano de acceso a corto o largo plazo a una rueda de actividad, reduciendo el desarrollo de deficit cognoscitivos. Ademas, el EF tambien puede actuar sobre las afectaciones conductuales que afectan al enfermo de Alzheimer, como la ansiedad, la emotividad y los aspectos motoresPor lo que respecta al enriquecimiento ambiental, se trata en incrementar la estimulacion y proporcionar oportunidades mas ricas y variadas de interaccion con el entorno social y fisico del paciente.

DSM-5에서는 DSM-IV와 동일한 10가지 성격장애의 범주적 접근을 유지하고 있다. 한편DSM-5의 Section III에는 차원-범주 혼합모형(hybrid dimensional-categorical model)이 제안되었다. 이로써 임상가는 개인의 성격기능에서의 어려움과 성격의 병리적 특질패턴에 근거하여 성격장애의 진단과 성격을 평가할 수 있다.",

Even expressions of a more conservative attitude concede, with some consistency, a connection between cerebral function and certain visceral ailments, prominent among which are peptic ulcer, hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. Speculation concerning possible relationship between cause and effect in such instances has resulted principally from clinical analysis of these disorders, particularly from the results of therapeutic attack on the autonomic nervous system in patients suffering from them. For obvious reasons, examination of psychosomatic disorders in experimental animals is extremely difficult.

Sometimes somnolence is one of the manifestations of a pathological process, and in others it is the major and dominant symptom bringing the patient to the doctor. Our experience in the study of hypersomnia (we have observed 120 patients in recent years) demonstrates that physicians have inadequate familiarity with this problem. Sometimes somnolence is regarded not as the result of pathology, but as a manifestation of excessive fatigue. There is inadequate differentiation of the forms of hypersomnic disorders. One of the causes of these errors is the absence of a logical classification. The most thorough classification is that of A. Epshtein, (1) etiological in nature: 1) random sleep disorders; 2) secondary sleep disorders; 3) constitutional neuropathic; 4) reactive; 5) symptomatic; 6) essential disorders; and 7) sleep disorders associated with psychosis.

Abstract The purpose of this project is to present the Escala Crespo-Bujosa de Sintomas Neurologicos Discretos (Crespo-Bujosa Neurological Soft Sign Scale). It has the purpose of carrying out a quick screening of the symptoms experimented by individuals with real neurologic indicators. Neurological Soft Signs (NSS) are defined as mild neurological irregularities, however, unequivocal, of primary sensory-motor functions. This behavioral and motor indicators do not necessarily have a systematic relation with a neuropathology. However, they may indicate neurological deterioration, developmental immaturity or an intermediate in the continuum in a lesion process. A transversal study was carried out with sample of 411 participants per disponibility with a majority of them being females (77.7%). The ages of the participants ranged from 18 to 94 years. 43% of the participants had received a neurological diagnosis (e.g. Epilepsy or Migraine, etc.) or neuropsychological (e.g. ADHD). Through structural equations it was found that the model has a good adjustment to evaluate the construct of NSS. The instrument shower a good adjustment and reliability. Each sub-scale measures a different dimension of NSS without redundancy between them. The item discrimination analysis ranged between .55 - .78 with a explained variance R 2 in the items per factor between .46 and .74. The discrimination indexes were at the minimum recommended of .30. The final scale groups the symptoms in three dimensions: a) neurocognitive symptoms, b) somatic symptoms and c) psychological symptoms.

      "abstract": "Medications with cognitive effects and/or side effects also affect sleep and dreaming. The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "title": "Aging, Disability and Frailty",
      "abstract": "Despite multiple and often overlapping definitions of disability and frailty, both are common clinical characteristics of aged individuals though not identical. The geriatric syndrome of frailty is described as status of global impairment of physiological reserves involving multiple organ systems. The clinical correlate of frailty manifests as increased vulnerability, impaired capability to withstand intrinsic and environmental stressors, and limited capacity to maintain physiological and psychosocial homeostasis. Geriatric frailty is found in 20–30% of the elderly population over 75 years and increases with advancing age. It was reported to be associated with long-term adverse health-related outcomes – increased risk of geriatric syndromes, dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional placement, and mortality. The clinical phenotype of frailty manifests as multi-system pathologies characterized by low physical activity, global weakness with low muscle strength, fatigability/exhaustion, overall slowness particularly of gait, loss of weight among others. These above-mentioned clinical symptoms could be explained by (or related to) some ‘preclinical’ diagnoses such as sarcopenia, osteopenia, nonspecific balance disorders, nutritional problems, and overall deconditioning. More recent studies found the frailty clinical phenotype to be associated with pathologic laboratory markers (IL-6, CRP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, IGF-1, D-dimers), which suggest possible pathogenesis involving hormonal dysregulation, immuno-aging, pro-coagulation and pro-inflammatory status. In the article, current recommendations for future research strategies of frailty syndrome will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "The authors reviewed available evidence regarding the status of dysphoric or mixed mania as a distinct clinical state and formulated operational criteria for its diagnosis.Studies of dysphoric mania or hypomania in patients with bipolar disorder were analyzed with regard to clinical characteristics, prevalence, demographic features, course of illness, outcome, family history, associated conditions, biological tests, and response to biological treatment.Although some studies suggest that dysphoric and nondysphoric mania are similar conditions, others suggest that, compared with nondysphoric mania, dysphoric mania may be more severe; more likely to occur in women; more likely to be associated with suicidality, a younger age at onset, a longer duration of illness, higher rates of personal and familial depression, concomitant alcohol or sedative-hypnotic abuse, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and poorer outcome; more frequently associated with cortisol nonsuppression; and less likely to respond adequately to lithium but perhaps more likely to respond to ECT or anticonvulsants.Substantial evidence suggests that dysphoric mania may be a distinct affective state. Contrary evidence, however, suggests that dysphoric mania may be a form of typical mania, a stage-related or severe form of mania, or a transitional state between mania and depression. Because the evidence may be inconsistent because of varying definitions of dysphoric mania among studies, the authors propose preliminary operational diagnostic criteria for the future study of dysphoric mania.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and progressive neurological disease, with an important socio-economic burden. Over time, an increased incidence of headaches like migraines and tension headaches has been observed among these patients. Headaches have not been considered as multiple sclerosis-related symptoms, even representing a red flag for multiple sclerosis diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the headache–multiple sclerosis association could be explained by the presence of common triggers or a common physiopathological mechanism (involvement of tertiary B-cell follicles). An important differential diagnosis is between multiple sclerosis attacks and migraines with aura, which can also be associated with neurological deficits. Another important aspect is the occurrence or exacerbation of the cephalalgic syndrome after the initiation of therapy for multiple sclerosis (DMTs), or the improvement of headache after the initiation of certain DMT drugs. In addition to headaches, individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis often report experiencing diverse pain syndromes, contributing to an additional decline in their overall quality of life. These syndromes are frequently neglected, the focus being on slowing down the progression of neurological deficits. This review aims to evaluate the characteristics of multiple-sclerosis-related headaches (frequency, possible correlation with attacks, and disease-modifying therapies) and the key distinctions in imaging characteristics between demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis and those observed in cases of primary headaches.",

      "abstract": "SummaryThe amount of tension in the muscular skeleton system is dependent on personality, physical constitution, longlasting recurrent or actual psychosomatic problems and learned behavior. Muscular tension becomes a coping mechanism to deal with somato-psychical and social difficulties. The literature shows possible biochemical correlations with states of depression, and also an impaired serotonin metabolism. However, not all patients suffer from depression. Further, a depressive, depressive-hypochondric state, and/or state of anxiety can be a consequence of fibromyalgia pain. Impaired non-REM sleep and a disturbed system of pain-modulation in the middle brain and brain stem, and a decreased tolerance of frustration, as well as frustrated aggression are assumed to be responsible for muscle contraction.In about 90% of the patients with fibromyalgia, psychoneuroses of different kinds have been found in which an impaired self- as well as an insufficient body awareness (partly as a consequence of the lasting pain) nearly always play a role. There are also significantly more life events and more problems compared to patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Four different strategies exist for therapy: 1) administration of antidepressive drugs; 2) relaxation: a) using drug therapy with benzodiazepines or meprobamate; b) with passive or, preferably, active physical therapy, resulting in physical strengthening, and leading also to an improved self-confidence c) autogenic training. 3) antirheumatic drug (for pain relief); 4) cognitive psychotherapy, individual and/or group, with the aim of cognitive reorientation, and fostering adequate strategies to cope with pain and problems.",

      "abstract": "The dissociative disorders, including \"psychogenic\" or \"functional\" amnesia, fugue, dissociative identity disorder (DID, also known as multiple personality disorder), and depersonalization disorder, were once classified, along with conversion disorder, as forms of hysteria. The 1970s witnessed an \"epidemic\" of dissociative disorder, particularly DID, which may have reflected enthusiasm for the diagnosis more than its actual prevalence. Traditionally, the dissociative disorders have been attributed to trauma and other psychological stress, but the existing evidence favoring this hypothesis is plagued by poor methodology. Prospective studies of traumatized individuals reveal no convincing cases of amnesia not attributable to brain insult, injury, or disease. Treatment generally involves recovering and working through ostensibly repressed or dissociated memories of trauma; at present, there are few quantitative or controlled outcome studies. Experimental studies are few in number and have focused largely on state-dependent and implicit memory. Depersonalization disorder may be in line for the next \"epidemic\" of dissociation.",

      "title": "Understanding Visual Disorders through Correlation of Clinical and Radiologic Findings",
      "abstract": "Patients presenting with visual disturbances often require a neuroimaging approach. The spectrum of visual disturbances includes three main categories: vision impairment, ocular motility dysfunction, and abnormal pupillary response. Decreased vision is usually due to an eye abnormality. However, it can also be related to other disorders affecting the visual pathway, from the retina to the occipital lobe. Ocular motility dysfunction may follow disorders of the cranial nerves responsible for eye movements (ie, oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves); may be due to any abnormality that directly affects the extraocular muscles, such as tumor or inflammation; or may result from any orbital disease that can alter the anatomy or function of these muscles, leading to diplopia and strabismus. Given that pupillary response depends on the normal function of the sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, an abnormality affecting these neuronal systems manifests, respectively, as pupillary miosis or mydriasis, with other related symptoms. In some cases, neuroimaging studies must complement the clinical ophthalmologic examination to better assess the anatomic and pathologic conditions that could explain the symptoms. US has a major role in the assessment of diseases of the eye and anterior orbit. CT is usually the first-line imaging modality because of its attainability, especially in trauma settings. MRI offers further information for inflammatory and tumoral cases. ©RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.",

      "abstract": "The recent discovery of autoimmune antibodies to the neuronal cell surface membrane and extra- or intra-cellular proteins, such as NMDAR and LGI1, shed light on a proposed new etiology of epilepsy, namely, \"autoimmune epilepsy\". A large part of this entity most likely belongs to a forme fruste of autoimmune (limbic) encephalitis. Seizures are usually subacute in onset and refractory to antiepileptic medications. Patients occasionally manifest multiple seizure semiologies, such as autonomic or faciobrachial dystonic seizures. They may develop other symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis to variable degrees. Clinical diagnosis of autoimmune epilepsy should be considered even before the results of antibody testing, when objective evidence of CNS inflammation, such as abnormal MRI (amygdala/hippocampal enlargement), FDG-PET (hypermetabolism), EEG (bitemporal spikes or subclinical seizure patterns) and/or CSF findings, are present. Early intensive immunotherapy could cure seizures and prevent the full-blown clinical manifestation of encephalitis. Some patients present with relatively mild clinical symptoms and/or MRI findings, and can have a smoldering course lasting years. Establishment of the biomarkers of the ongoing CNS inflammation, especially for the smoldering and the suspected autoantibody-negative cases, is warranted for tailored immunotherapy for both the subacute and chronic phases of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction or Ogilvie's syndrome is a disorder causing massive colonic dilation with no evidence of mechanical obstruction. The actual incidence of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is unclear; However, electrolyte imbalance, psychiatric disorders, the use of medications such as anticholinergics or antipsychotics, and recent abdominal surgery are the most common predisposing factors associated with this syndrome. Ogilvie's syndrome is most likely caused due to impairment of the gut's motor system and an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system including a reduction in the activity of stimulatory neurotransmitters. The predisposition to psychotic disorders could be, in some instances, due to neurodevelopmental abnormalities of the brain and the gut’s autonomic nervous system. The symptoms of Ogilvie's syndrome are similar to mechanical obstruction of the colon but no physical cause of obstruction is usually present. Ogilvie's syndrome can be managed conservatively; however, if left untreated, Ogilvie's syndrome can lead to bowel perforation, which is associated with a high mortality risk. Antipsychotics have been considered the cornerstone treatment for psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. Even though they are highly effective in treating psychiatric illnesses, their usage carries multiple risks. Overall, constipation is a common side effect of antipsychotic medications with some classes posing more risk than others. Constipation can be severe and may lead to serious complications such as paralytic ileus, bowel ischemia, and death. We present here a case of delusional disorder managed with risperidone and complicated by intestinal pseudo-obstruction. This case reiterates the need to consider all complications of antipsychotic medications, even rare ones, and include them in the discussion with patients and their caregivers before commencement.",

The main clinical features are new weakness, muscular fatigability, general fatigue, and pain. The primary criteria necessary for the diagnosis of PPS are a history of paralytic poliomyelitis, partial or complete recovery of neurological function followed by a period of stability (usually several decades), persistent new muscle weakness or abnormal muscle fatigability, and the exclusion of other causes of new symptoms. The cause of PPS remains unclear, but is likely due to a distal degeneration of enlarged post-poliomyelitis motor units. Contributing factors to PPS may be aging (with motor neuron loss), overuse, and disuse. PPS is usually a slowly progressive neuromuscular disease. Although there is no specific treatment for PPS, an interdisciplinary management program can be useful in controlling symptoms. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Muscle Nerve 2005",

The canonical phenotypeof the Parkinson's disease Dementia (PD-D) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) includes deficit of attention, executiveand visuospatial functions, and presents often with apathy, hallucinations, delusions, excessive daytime sleepiness,or sleep disorders. However, the clinical expression may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases associatedwith cognitive disorders. Thus, while clinicians rely on phenomenological patterns to infer the disease causing thecognitive impairment, the inference is weakened by the heterogeneous clinical expression of the disease. In addition,recent post-mortem studies seem to undermine the supposed pathology-phenotype coherence, making it moreand more unreliable the diagnosis based on symptoms. The lack of coherence between phenotype and pathologymay support the speculation about a common mechanism underlying the progression of the disease. While it is verylikely that a distinct, specific causal event determines the disease itself, the progression might well follow commonpatterns. A number of observations suggest that progressive diseases, which cause cognitive impairment, share aprion-like mechanism. A seeding process is supposed to account for the spreading of the lesion.",

Dieser Nachweis kann nur in Einzelfällen erfolgen. Größere systematische Untersuchungen fehlen. Die International Classification of Headache Disorders der International Headache Society erkennt auch in ihrer dritten Auflage (Beta-Version) nur die Somatisierungsstörung und die psychotische Störung als mögliche psychische Erkrankungen für die Auslösung sekundärer Kopfschmerzen an.

Other neurodevelopmental disorders may appear as a comorbidity or mimicking ADHD itself.This study reviews the high prevalence of other neurodevelopmental disorders (specific learning difficulties, communication disorders, etc.) in patients with ADHD. Moreover, the possible differential diagnoses include the same neurodevelopmental disorders that can occur as a comorbidity. Based on the literature, the study evaluates the role of clinical evaluation and neuropsychology in distinguishing between comorbidity and mimicry.The clinical evaluation could be insufficient for the comorbid diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders. In these cases, a neuropsychological evaluation is generally required, since it can also offer alternative diagnostic hypotheses about the symptoms observed and may therefore be a valuable aid for the differential diagnosis.Neurodesarrollo y fenocopias del trastorno por deficit de atencion/hiperactividad: diagnostico diferencial.Introduccion.

Se revisa la elevada prevalencia de otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo (trastornos especificos del aprendizaje, trastornos de la comunicacion...) en los pacientes con TDAH.

      "abstract": "Placebo effect is an example of ‘contextual’ effect and is the symptomatic improvement experienced by patients who have unknowingly received a placebo (inactive treatment) instead of an active drug. It occurs due to patient-specific factors such as expectation of improvement and is influenced by the context in which the treatment is delivered. Nocebo effect is the opposite of placebo effect and includes worsening of symptoms or incident adverse effects due to expectancy or negative contextual or practitioner influence. Placebo effect has been demonstrated in a range of musculoskeletal conditions, including osteoarthritis (OA), as well as other conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and asthma. In OA, the placebo effect is strongest for subjective outcomes like pain. In fact, the effect size (ES) of placebo analgesia in OA clinical trials (0.51) is clinically significant and higher than the ES (defined by the additional improvement above placebo) obtained from non-pharmacological (0.25) and pharmacological (0.39) treatments. A number of patient- and intervention-specific and contextual factors influence the magnitude of placebo-induced improvements. Placebo analgesia is real, not a ‘trick of the mind’, and results from central mechanisms that increase descending inhibition of pain. Contextual effects are an integral part of everyday clinical practice. While patient- and intervention-specific determinants cannot be changed easily, healthcare practitioners should optimize the physician-specific factors that enhance positive contextual response and minimize nocebo response. Such a strategy that will increase the overall improvement is particularly relevant for OA where there is no ‘cure’ and a predominance of negative beliefs.",

At times it is the first symptom of an organic neurological disease. It is often masked as a psychiatric disorder or is associated with a mental illness without clinically detectable seizures. These psychic manifestations simulate all of the neuroses and major psychiatric states. Excitement states with amnesia may lead to violent antisocial behavior. All these manifestations may be aggravated by alcohol. Thalamic epilepsy shows itself in similar psychiatric manifestations and accounts for behavior disorder in children more than temporal lobe epilepsy. Atypical seizures with vegetative or emotional aura and a characteristic electroencephalogram differentiate it from temporal lobe epilepsy. Proper understanding of the varied manifestations, with positive electroencephalographic findings, leads to the correct diagnosis in most cases. All patients with unusual or atypical personality or psychiatric-like states should have careful electroencephalographic examination. Anticonvulsant therapy and other psychiatric treatment procedures can relieve most cases. Surgical therapy sometimes is necessary.",

Time spent on it is well worth while. The poor witness can be helped by leading questions. After taking the detailed history it should be possible to list the probable site or sites of the nervous system affected, from muscle to cerebral cortex. Also, from the course of development of the symptoms (for example, whether episodic or progressive), it should be possible to suggest the likely pathological diagnosis.

Raziskave na živalih nakazujejo, da so nevroni v fazi celičnega razvoja bolj občutljivi na škodljive učinke splošnih anestetikov v primerjavi z zrelimi nevroni.

Večina ugotovljenih primanjkljajev je subkliničnih, kažejo pa se na širokem področju kognitivnih sposobnosti, pri splošnih intelektualnih sposobnostih pa primanjkljajev niso dokazali. Kognitivne posledice splošne anestezije pri otrocih so lahko raznolike in se prepletajo s samim vzrokom za uporabo splošne anestezije.

Splošni konsenz je, da bi kljub morebitnemu tveganju za kognitivno oškodovanost, izostanek od potrebnih zdravstvenih posegov prinesel več negativnih posledic kot splošna anestezija, zaradi česar pa je iz psihološkega vidika smiselno, da smo pri obravnavi pozorni tudi na morebitne težave otrok, ki so bili izpostavljeni medicinskim posegom pod splošno anestezijo.",

      "abstract": "O meu interesse por este estudo surgiu na pratica da psicologia clinica em contexto escolar. De um modo geral, na escola, o grande motivo das consultas de psicologia e o insucesso escolar, traduzido pela dificuldade e mesmo incapacidade de adquirir, reter ou usar conhecimentos. A observacao psicologica permite verificar que, na sua maioria, estes alunos apresentam um potencial intelectual normal e, por vezes, superior, evidenciando, no entanto, afectos depressivos ou dificuldades na elaboracao das angustias depressivas. Sao adolescentes carentes de um ‘apport’ narcisico suficiente e que, face a estas circunstâncias, apresentam, entre outras, dificuldades escolares. O que, de facto, se tem verificado e que o insucesso escolar e as dificuldades escolares que chegam ate nos estao relacionados com uma imaturidade, implicando uma importante depressao ou organizacao depressiva base. Na maioria das vezes, porem, este quadro depressivo aparece mais ou menos disfarcado por sintomas comportamentais diversos, como defice de atencao/concentracao, instabilidade psicomotora, hiperactividade, entre outros. Com efeito, o insucesso escolar e, seguramente, um sinal de que algo nao vai bem com aquele adolescente. Estes dados sugerem que, na realidade, o processo de aprendizagem tem ritmos diferentes, que dependem nao so de factores cognitivos como tambem afectivos, relacionais e emocionais. Por outro lado, tambem se tem verificado que alunos apresentando sucesso escolar manifestam sinais de caracter mais depressivo, como: instabilidade, inseguranca – por exemplo, em situacao de avaliacao mostram falta de seguranca, sao os ultimos a entregar as suas respostas e consideram sempre que ainda nao deve estar bem; comprometimento das relacoes sociais - o fins-de-semana sao, frequentemente, passados a estudar, havendo pouco tempo para os amigos; alteracoes alimentares e de sono – nomeadamente, a perda de apetite e a insonia. Algumas vezes, estes alunos, face a resultados escolares que consideram pouco satisfatorios (‘Bom’ em vez de ‘Muito Bom’; ‘Satisfaz’ em vez de ‘Bom’) expressam afectos de tonalidade depressiva como ‘nao presto para nada’, choro e agressividade dirigida ao proprio. A proposito da agressividade, recentemente, um adolescente em situacao de consulta referiu: ‘quando nao consigo resolver um problema, tenho vontade de me bater, fico mesmo zangado comigo’. Nestes casos, o sucesso escolar e uma ‘mascara’ que esconde dificuldades ou ate mesmo perturbacoes afectivas. Tambem nestes casos de elevado sucesso escolar convem parar e reflectir. Nesta etapa de desenvolvimento, o estudo e importante, mas nao e tudo; e necessario realizar com sucesso as tarefas da adolescencia. Uma outra motivacao para a realizacao deste trabalho foi tambem o facto de que, nos dias de hoje, e fundamental alertar para o facto de que o Sistema Educativo compa",

Every strongly relevant individual concern, like fears, can yield cognitive bias or \"cognitive-emotional sensitization\". It might also be present for bodily and environmental information related to illness, and could be an etiological factor in medically unexplained complaints. Physiological and cognitive sensitization are theoretically compared. There is evidence for cognitive-emotional sensitization in some medically unexplained somatic complaints, and negative affect is suggested as a catalyst. Prolonged cognitive-emotional sensitization (\"perseverative negative cognition\" or worry, rumination) might even have demonstrable somatic pathological effects. It is concluded that sensitization may be organized at different levels, both in the organism and in the larger living system within which the organism is subsumed. This view might not only help to clarify medically unexplained pain syndromes, but virtually every subjective complaint, both with and without recognized physiopathology.",

In many neurological disease states associated with subcortical pathology a similar pattern of dementia exists. The neurobehavioural changes of progressive supranuclear palsy thus typify a clinical pattern which may be referred to as subcortical dementia. The subcortical dementias have a striking clinical resemblance to the dementia which occurs after bifrontal lobe disease. However, the subcortical dementias can be clearly distinguished clinically from cortical dementias, other than frontal dementias. We propose as a tentative hypothesis that there may be common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the subcortical dementias—in particular, disturbances of timing and activation. There are immediate practical implications of this hypothesis: drugs which have an effect on subcortical timing and activating mechanisms may be useful in the treatment of subcortical dementias.",

Although there is growing evidence that neuropsychiatric symptoms may precede the prodromal stages of dementia, these manifestations have received less attention than traditional clinical hallmarks such as cognitive and functional deterioration. Depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, agitation, sleep disorders, among other symptoms, have been hypothesized to represent a prodromal stage of dementia or, at least, they increase the risk for conversion from minor neurocognitive disorder to major neurocognitive disorder. Longitudinal investigations have provided increased evidence of progression to dementia in individuals with minor neurocognitive disorder when neuropsychiatric symptoms also were present.Although neuropsychiatric symptoms are strongly associated with a higher risk of cognitive and functional deterioration, frequently the clinician does not acknowledge these conditions as increasing the risk of dementia. When the clinician accurately diagnoses neuropsychiatric symptoms in the prodromal stage of dementia, he could early establish appropriate treatment and, may be, delay the beginning of clinical and functional deterioration.",

Her postconcussive symptoms are affecting her school performance and social and family life. Clinical Outcomes Assessment: Concussion is typically evaluated via symptoms, cognition, and balance. There is no specific patient-oriented outcomes measure for concussion. Clinicians can choose from a variety of generic and specific outcomes instruments aimed at assessing general health-related quality of life or various concussion symptoms and comorbidities such as headache, migraine, fatigue, mood disturbances, depression, anxiety, and concussion-related symptoms. Clinical Decision Making: The data obtained from patient self-report instruments may not actively help clinicians make return-to-play decisions; however, these scales may be useful in providing information that may help the athlete return to school, work, and social activities. The instruments may also serve to identify issues that may lead to problems down the road, including depression or anxiety, or serve to further explore the nature of an athlete’s symptoms. Clinical Bottom Line: Concussion results in numerous symptoms that have the potential to linger and has been associated with depression and anxiety. The use of outcomes scales to assess health-related quality of life and the effect of other symptoms that present with a concussion may allow clinicians to better evaluate the effects of concussion on physical, cognitive, emotional, social, school, and family issues, leading to better and more complete management.",

      "title": "MILD BEHAVIORAL IMPAIRMENT: A PRODROMAL STAGE OF FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the third most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies. FTLD is a disorder of behavior, social conduct, and executive function and starts between the ages of 40 and 60. The Neary research criteria define three clinical FTLD syndromes.1 The hypothesis that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional state between normal cognitive aging and dementia is widely accepted. Three types are defined (Table 1): MCI-amnestic; MCI-multiple domains, slightly impaired (for example, vascular cognitive impairment); and MCI-single nonmemory domain.2 The last presents as impairment in a single cognitive domain other than memory, such as a dysexecutive syndrome. This condition was described as mild behavioral impairment (MBI) and as MCI of the frontotemporal type.3,4 Three patients referred to the memory clinic are described. A 56-year-old man had conflicts at work due to poor judgment. He became gradually more aggressive and showed signs of hyperorality and disinhibition. His score was 36 of 72 (cutoff=27) on the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI)5 and 24 of 42 (cutoff=14) on the Apathy Scale of Starkstein.6 Cerebral single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning revealed left frontotemporal hypoperfusion. Neuropsychological testing showed impairment on frontal executive tests, but he did not meet the criteria for FTLD, and his wife reported normal activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and general functioning. A diagnosis of MBI was made. He was treated with citalopram, a serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and became less disinhibited. A year later, his memory had deteriorated. A 62-year-old male teacher presented with changes in behavior. He had always been aggressive, but during the previous 2 years showed loss of empathy, impulsivity, hyperorality, inflexibility, and repetitive behavior. He had a high score on the FBI (54). SPECT scanning showed left temporal hypoperfusion. Neuropsychological evaluation revealed some repetitive behavior, loss of insight, and mildly decreased verbal fluency, but he did not meet the criteria for FTLD, and his wife reported normal IADLs/ADLs and general functioning. Because of persistent behavioral changes, mild psychiatric symptoms, no memory complaints, and normal functioning, he was diagnosed with MBI. Citalopram improved his aggression slightly. A 57-year-old man developed apathy, aspontaneity, and behavioral changes with emotional unconcern and inflexibility. He made repetitive noises, lacked initiative, and showed inappropriate behavior and disinhibition in eating. His FBI score was 43. SPECT scanning demonstrated bilateral frontal hypoperfusion. Neuropsychological examination revealed general slowing, intact memory and orientation, diminished flexibility and self-inhibition, decreased verbal fluency, and mild executive problems, but he did not meet the criteria for FTLD, and his wife reported normal IADLs/ADLs. A diagnosis of MBI was made. A year later, he had developed FTLD. By separating clinical and preclinical stages, the importance of disease course is emphasized, which makes it possible to describe various stages of the same disease or, alternatively, to describe one disease-related syndrome that changes its features over time as the disease process continues. Dementia presents with psychiatric symptoms in about 50% of cases. Diagnosis is difficult when symptoms are still mild and atypical. A prospective cohort study of nondemented patients at risk of FTLD was performed;3 after 3 years 77% had developed into dementia: 7% dementia with Lewy bodies, 25% AD, and 45% FTLD; six of seven patients diagnosed with MCI of the frontotemporal type developed FTLD within a mean±standard deviation of 1.8±1.0 years.4 In the case with disinhibition as an early symptom, the risk of dementia was more than two and a half times as high. In the case with a frontotemporal SPECT pattern, the risk of FTLD was three and a half times as high. A normal SPECT decreased the risk of dementia 93%, so functional imaging is a valuable tool.3 If a normally functioning person presents with persistent mild psychiatric symptoms, especially disinhibition, MBI should be considered. SPECT scanning is recommended. In populations without dementia, behavioral symptoms often improve with medications that increase serotonin activity. Low serotonin-receptor binding has been reported in FTLD. Treatment with SSRIs improved behavioral symptoms in at least half of FTLD patients.7 It has been reported that paroxetine addressed anxiety and repetitive, ritualistic behaviors.8 In FTLD, treatment with SSRIs is considered of interest when the target symptoms are disinhibition, compulsion, and hyperphagia. Citalopram had a positive effect in two patients. If treatment is necessary, a tentative course of SSRIs is recommended. In a recent open-label study, rivastigmine improved behavioral symptoms in patients with FTLD and reduced caregiver burden.9 If SSRIs are ineffective in controlling the core features of MBI, rivastigmine may provide a therapeutic option. Awareness of the concept of MBI prevents stigmatization of a patient with a probable organic brain disease as a psychiatric patient. Proper diagnosis in an early stage may reduce patient and caregiver stress. Financial Disclosure(s): Schölzel-Dorenbos had no financial support for this manuscript.

      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

Увеличилось распространение опухолей, сердечно-сосудистых, нейро-дегенеративных болезней, стрессовых состояний и других нарушений регуляции. Совокупная неврологическая патология стала самой распространенной причиной инвалидности и одной из частых причин смерти. Эту неблагоприятную тенденцию удается в значительной степени преодолеть своеобразной гимнастикой для мозга, усложнением его работы, необходимостью одновременно выполнять две задачи. Обе задачи могут быть двигательные или когнитивные, или одна двигательная, другая - когнитивная. Синхронное выполнение двух задач совершенствует функцию мозга, улучшает состояние человека в старости и при многих болезнях. The increased life expectancy, the aging of the Earth’s population, and the reduced physical activity in work and everyday life have changed the nosological profile of mankind. The prevalence of tumors, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative diseases, stress conditions, and other dysregulations has increased. Cumulative neurological pathology has become the most common cause of disability and one of the most common causes of death. This unfavorable trend can be largely overcome by a kind of exercise for the brain that complicates its work by the requirement to perform two tasks simultaneously. Both tasks can be either motor or cognitive, or one task can be motor and the other cognitive. The synchronous performance of two tasks improves the brain function in old age and in many diseases.",

      "abstract": "Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the prevalent and disabling psychiatric disorders. MDD is a complex disorder with marked heterogeneity in pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Currently, neuroimaging has given new insights into the structure and function of the brain in individuals with major depression. Methods: We did a Medline search with key words ”major depressive disorder” combined with ”neuroimaging” or ”brain imaging” up to May 15, 2008. We reviewed all identified published articles. Results: The most consistent findings in the pathophysiology studies of MDD with neuroimaging are abnormalities in the anterior regions of the brain, especially frontal, limbic, and cingulate regions, which presenting with increased rate of white matter hyperintensities, defect of white matter integrity, reduced glial cell density, reductions in cerebral flow or glucose metabolism. Thus, MDD is a brain disorder proved by neuroimaging and other biological findings. Findings of the regional abnormalities by neuroimaging may have clinical utility in both diagnosis and treatment of depression. Neuroimaging in geriatric depression found more subcortical ischemic vascular lesion, which is called vascular depression. It is noteworthy that the involved regions of brain and the neural processing of facial expressions may differ between MDD and bipolar disorder. Interestingly, there are clear regional change pattern differences across unique treatments, including medication and cognitive behavior therapy, affecting similar region but in different ways. Conclusion: We conclude that the findings of neuroimaging in individuals with MDD can help clinicians to get comprehensive understanding of depression in pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment, and to ensure the quality of care in depression.",

      "title": "Practical approach to the patient with acute neuromuscular weakness",
      "abstract": "Acute neuromuscular paralysis (ANMP) is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapid onset muscle weakness progressing to maximum severity within several days to weeks (less than 4 wk). Bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness may or may not be present. It is a common neurological emergency which requires immediate and careful investigations to determine the etiology because accurate diagnosis has significant impact on therapy and prognosis. Respiratory failure caused by neuromuscular weakness is considered as more critical than lung disease because its development may be insidious or subtle until sudden decompensation leads to life threatening hypoxia. Also, the arterial blood gas finding of severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis may not be apparent until respiratory failure is profound. Hence, the requirement for respiratory assistance should also be intensively and promptly investigated in all patients with neuromuscular disease. The disorder is classified based on the site of defect in motor unit pathway, i.e., anterior horn cells, nerve root, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction or muscle. Identification of the cause is primarily based on a good medical history and detailed clinical examination supplemented with neurophysiologic investigations and sometimes few specific laboratory tests. Medical history and neurological examination should be focused on the onset, progression, pattern and severity of muscle weakness as well as cranial nerves testing and tests for autonomic dysfunction. Associated non neurological features like fever, rash or other skin lesions etc. should also be noted. Globally, Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most frequent cause of ANMP and accounts for the majority of cases of respiratory muscles weakness associated with neuromuscular disorders. Newly acquired neuromuscular weakness in intensive care unit patients consist of critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy and drug induced neuromuscular weakness which may arise as a consequence of sepsis, multi-organ failure, and exposure to certain medications like intravenous corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The terms organic brain syndrome and dementia are applied to those acquired disorders of thinking and cognitive functions where altered structure or function of the brain can be identified. Generally, neurologists care for patients with these disorders. When no lesion or physiologic change is apparent, cognitive dysfunctions are often labeled functional or psychological disorders. Psychiatrists care for these patients. The inadequacy of this distinction is immediately apparent: any change in behavior must be the result of altered brain activity. In 1994 DSM-IV recognized this arbitrary distinction and did away with the division of behavior disorders into organic and nonorganic conditions. The section called “Organic Disorders” in previous DSM editions is called “Delirium, Dementia, and Amnestic and Other Cognitive Disorders” in DSM-IV; this category now stands alongside Affective, Anxiety, Schizophrenic Disorders, etc., removing any implication that there is one group of disorders related to the brain and another group that is just psychological (Tucker et al., 1994). To some degree, cognitive, affective, and behavioral symptoms characterize all disorders of the brain. There are cognitive disturbances in most of the major psychiatric disorders (see Chapters 3 and 5). However, the primary symptoms of delirium, dementia, and amnestic disorders are disturbances of cognition. Cognition comes from the Latin cognitio, which means to think.",

      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable.

      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

While the prevalence of sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome has a pronounced increase across the lifespan (1-3), the prevalence of psychiatric conditions such as mood and anxiety disorders remains somewhat constant frommiddle to old age (4). Sleep disturbance is a symptom criterion across a number of psychiatric illnesses, including many of the mood and anxiety disorders as delineated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th revision (DSM) (5). Most commonly, the sleep disturbance is in the form of an insomnia complaint and to a lesser extent it relates to hypersomnia and other common disorders of sleep such as sleep apnea. Alterations in sleep architecture are evidenced across a variety of mood and anxiety disorders when sleep is subjected to polysomnographic evaluation. It is also the case that a host of psychotropic medications either alter sleep architecture and/or contribute to subjective sleep complaints.",

Pronoran (piribedil) combines the dopaminergic and noradrenergic properties; its effectiveness has been studied and has been proven in more than  15 clinical studies, which were attended by a total of more than  7 thousand patients from around the world.",

      "abstract": "Inflammation is a key element in the pathophysiology of Central Nervous System (CNS) diseases, irrespective of the etiology of such diseases. From inflammatory or infectious diseases to neurodegenerative, ischemic or traumatic diseases, inflammation plays a fundamental role both in controlling the ongoing pathological processes and in promoting neuroprotection or regeneration. Indeed, due to the complex architecture and activities in the brain, the side effects of brain inflammation are fundamental to the outcome of neurological diseases (for example bystander neuronal damage). The CNS differs from the other organs as it is partially isolated from the immune system by the restrictive blood-brain barrier and the presence of an immunosuppressive environment (brain immune privilege). Inappropriate immune responses are responsible for diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or for the increased disability after brain trauma or stroke. Inflammation also plays an important role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer (AD) or Parkinson diseases (PD). However, in certain circumstances immune responses in the brain might have a neuroprotective effect, possibly mediating the release of trophic factors by inflammatory or glial cells. Neurotrophic factors protect axons and myelin from inflammatory damage, and they have immunosuppressive properties that contribute to the maintenance of brain immune privilege. Thus, in addition to their neuroprotective activities, neurotrophic factors may offer new therapeutic perspectives by targeting inflammatory processes in brain disorders.

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequently a symptom of depression. Patients with mood disorders were found to have more robust changes across more sleep parameters than did patients with other disorders or healthy controls. The association between depression and disturbed sleep has been well documented in both clinical and epidemiologic studies. Adequately addressing sleep disturbance is particular relevant for these patients, as there is some evidence that the presence of sleep complaint is associated with greater severity of patient's primary condition. There is both objective and subjective evidence that sleep is disturbed in depressed patients. Subjective assessments of sleep in patients with depression tend to confirm objective measures (polysomnographic recordings). Interesting findings derive from the study of sleep microstructure and in particular cyclic alternating pattern. It's also important to consider that many medications used to treat depression may disturb sleep. Given a clear association between sleep disturbances and depression, a number of important clinical issues remain to be elucidated in order to improve diagnosis, allow for better treatment decisions and aid in the development of new therapies.",

In addition, modifying psychological and social factors are discussed.Older adults appear to be at greater risk for major depression biologically, such as depression resulting from vascular changes, yet the frequency of depression is lower compared to younger adults. Older adults may be protected psychologically due to factors such as socio-emotional selectivity and wisdom, compared to younger adults, and perhaps relatively protected from social risks.A biopsychosocial approach to evaluating the origins of late-life depression is heuristically valuable, a continual reminder of the many factors that contribute to the onset and persistence of clinically significant symptoms in late life.",

      "title": "[Unawareness of deficits in Alzheimer's disease: a multidimentional approach].",
      "abstract": "Partial or complete unawareness of deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may result in delaying diagnosis and difficulties for caring. Many theories have been proposed to explain unawareness of neurological or cognitive deficits. Neurological theories use the term of anosognosia to describe unawareness as a consequence of the severity and location of brain lesions. They predict an association between the unawareness of deficits in AD and the severity of dementia or location of the lesions in the right cerebral hemisphere or in the frontal regions. More recent theories have been based on models derived from cognitive neuropsychology. Some models have been designed to explain unawareness of specific deficits such as the memory disorders, others are more extensive based on models of consciousness of the Self. Psychopathological theories postulate that unawareness of deficits is the consequence of a psychological defense mechanism, termed denial. Therefore, unawareness of deficits in AD should be linked to the premorbid personality, abilities to cope with the disease and its consequences more than to the severity and location of brain lesions. The validity of each theory is discussed according to the data from the literature. However, the analysis of the literature is clouded by many methodological difficulties due to the variability of terminology and tools used to assess the unawareness. Moreover, most studies were too narrowly focused on specific points, not taking into account a global model of insight. Nevertheless, some conclusions can be drawn from the available data: 1) the nature of the unawareness of deficits in AD is multidimensional. Terms such anosognosia or denial do not describe single phenomena but correspond to disturbances of various neurological, neuropsychological and psychopathological mechanisms, which can not be explained by a single theory; 2) unawareness should no more be considered as a category but according to a dimensional approach. There is a wide range of levels of unawareness, which can vary from one moment to an other and during the progression of the disease; 3) neurological, neuropsychological and psychopathological mechanisms implicated in unawareness probably coexist in various degrees depending, on one hand, on the disease severity and type of deficits and, on the other hand, on the history and personality of the patient, his(her) familial support, but also on the social perception of the disease. To improve our understanding of the unawareness of deficits in AD, we propose to come back to a detailed clinical description investigating extensively the various aspects of insight.",

In most cases, neuropathic pain is associated with poor general health and has a problem of suboptimal response to medical treatment. This review will discuss the neurologic and non-neurologic conditions that cause neuropathic pain and the results of epidemiologic studies on neuropathic pain.Current Concepts: Epidemiology would be a useful clinical tool for designing management and prevention strategies for various neuropathic pain syndromes. Validated neuropathic pain screening questionnaires are widely used as useful tools for the epidemiologic study of neuropathic pain. There are also validated Korean versions of these questionnaires. The overall prevalence of neuropathic pain was estimated at 6.9-10%. Common neuropathic pain syndromes include diabetic neuropathy, herpes zoster, and trigeminal neuralgia. In addition, neuropathic pain can also occur in central nervous system disorders such as spinal cord injury or stroke, and other conditions like cancerous diseases, intervertebral disc disease, and joint diseases.Discussion and Conclusion: Neuropathic pain does not respond well to medical treatment, which leaves both patients and physicians are less satisfied with such treatments. Therefore, physicians must identify the causes of the pain, explain them to the patient, and proceed with the treatment together with patients.",

      "abstract": "The authors explore the possibility that psychiatrists inappropriately extend their views on suicide by the medically well to refusal of lifesaving treatment by the seriously medically ill.The legal and bioethics literature on competence to refuse lifesaving treatment and the possible impact of depression on this refusal is reviewed.Over the past 20 years, the burden of proof concerning the mental competence of seriously medically ill patients who refuse lifesaving treatment has shifted to the persons who seek to override these refusals. However, in psychiatry a patient's desire to die is generally considered to be evidence of an impaired capacity to make decisions about lifesaving treatment. This contrast between ethical traditions is brought into clinical focus during the evaluation and treatment of medically ill patients with depression who refuse lifesaving treatment. The clinical evaluation of the effect of depression on a patient's capacity to make medical decisions is difficult for several reasons: 1) depression is easily seen as a \"reasonable\" response to serious medical illness, 2) depression produces more subtle distortions of decision making than delirium or psychosis (i.e., preserving the understanding of medical facts while impairing the appreciation of their personal importance), and 3) a diagnosis of major depression is neither necessary nor sufficient for determining that the patient's medical decision making is impaired.Depression can be diagnosed and treated in patients with serious medical illness. But after optimizing medical and psychiatric treatment and determining that the patient is competent to make medical decisions, it may be appropriate to honor the patient's desire to die.",

Less attention is paid to autonomic dysfunctions, although they produce a serious impact on the quality of life. In addition to motor disabilities, patients also have non‑motor dysfunctions. Regardless of its clinical forms, patients with multiple sclerosis may have autonomous disturbances such as bladder, sexual, cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, gastrointestinal dysfunction and fatigue. These must be identified based on medical history, clinical symptoms, and specific paraclinical tests. In addition to the multitude of immunomodulatory therapeutic agents that influence the progression of the disease, the therapy of autonomic dysfunctions remains difficult to address.

This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

Abstract:Cotard’s syndrome is a rare neuropsychiatric condition characterised by extreme delusion of nihilism or negation towards self. It is mostly associated with psychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder, schizophrenia as well as some organic brain conditions like brain injury, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis etc. Of the innumerable types of presentations of this condition, food refusal is a rare type and hence we report this case as such.

The clinical relevance and public health impact of poor insight is reflected by its close association with important clinical outcome measures, such as treatment non-adherence, lower psychosocial functioning, poor prognosis, involuntary hospitalization, and higher utilization of emergency services. Although the neurobiology of insight has not been determined, data from neurocognitive and a few structural imaging studies provide some understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of insight function in schizophrenia. Using published and preliminary data, we propose a hypothetical model of insight that may help initiate neurobiological investigations in this complex area.",

      "title": "Public health and insomnia: economic impact.",
      "abstract": "There seems to be a lack of understanding between practitioners and patients on the topic of insomnia. One adult out of four complains of insomnia; however only one insomniac out of four has ever complained about it to their practitioner during a visit made for another problem and only one out of twenty has come to discuss specifically the problem of his or her insomnia. Only a few patients with insomnia take a treatment for it. This gap between the patient's feeling and the practitioner's answer has to be better understood if we want to know why insomnia seems to be so prevalent and what impact it has on society. One aspect may be a question of definition. Insomnia may be considered an ordinary complaint (after one poor night) or as a chronic disease. Practitioners have poor knowledge about sleep disorders and may be embarrassed about coping with an impairment they never specifically learned to manage. The second aspect concerns the impact of insomnia on daytime alertness and performance. While patients usually complain of an impaired daytime functioning with a feeling of fatigue, sleepiness, and risk of mistakes, many studies of insomniacs do not reveal any increased sleepiness or decrease of performance (measured by objective tests) the day following a poor night. Practitioners may therefore find it difficult to understand the real impact of insomnia on daytime functioning. The third aspect is related to the large co-morbidity between insomnia and psychiatric diseases, especially depression and anxiety. It does make it harder for practitioners to define whether the sleep impairment suffered by their patient is the cause for other symptoms or the consequence of an underlying disease. Thus, it makes it all the more difficult for the practitioner to determine which treatment is the most appropriate. These aspects have to be clarified if one wants to estimate the real impact of insomnia on society. It could be useful to both practitioners and patients to have a better understanding on the relationship between poor sleep and daily lives.",

This report presents neuropsychological test findings of 35 Cushing's syndrome patients before initiation of medical therapy, and documents the frequency, nature, and severity of deficits. Performances on the Michigan Neuropsychological Test Battery revealed equivocal or no signs of neuropsychological deficits in 13 patients. Ten other patients had few and mild deficits, eight had moderate and more frequent signs of impairment, and four had frequent and marked deficits in language and nonlanguage tests of higher (cognitive) and/or lower (sensory and/or motor) level cerebral functions. The findings thus indicate varying degrees of diffuse bilateral cerebral dysfunction in two thirds of this population. Impairment was more frequent and severe in non verbal visual-ideational and visual memory functions. This pattern of deficits is similar to that in patients with other types of diffuse bilateral neuropathological processes such as toxicity, anoxia, and infectious cerebral disorders.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Parasomnias are disorders that may appear during sleep with and/or without dreams. To describe them we must take in account a subjective description by the patient and his relatives. Objective measurement of this phenomenology is made with Polysomnography, Electromyography and Holter EKG. Material and Methods: We searched the recent data about parasomnia in the Medline, Pubmed, Google academic databases as also in classic books and reviews. Results: The clinical picture is various from motor and neurological signs to autonomic signs as also sleep related hallucinations. There are more rare presentations with associated disorders due to excretion and involuntary urinary emission during sleep disorders. Parasomnias are often preceded by a traumatic event for the patient and his family members which can be a head trauma or an infection or an intoxication which can be accompanied by psycho vulnerable events. On the other part parasomnias can be themselves a preamble announcing neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson disease, Lewy Body Dementia or some synucleopathies. Conclusions: The fluctuations of neurotransmitters (Dopamine, Serotonine or Acetylcholine) due to specific neurologic pathology can lead to particular parasomnias, their evolution corresponding to each impairment. The knowledge of accompanying parasomnias of neurologic disorders like those from Parkinson disease helps manage diseases of neurological patients already known with Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases, leading to increased quality of life for these patients as a result of specialized intervention.",

      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State",
      "abstract": "Consciousness is a multifaceted concept that has two dimensions: arousal, or wakefulness (i.e., level of consciousness), and awareness (i.e., content of consciousness) (Laureys et al., 2004).An accurate and reliable assessment of the arousal and awareness of consciousness in patients with severe brain damage is of greatest importance for the differential diagnosis of low levels consciousness patients and for outcome evaluation.Following coma, some patients permanently lose all brainstem function (brain death), some progress to \"wakeful unawareness\" (vegetative state -VS), whereas others recover typically and progress through different stages before fully or partly recovering consciousness (minimally conscious state -MCS).Patients in VS can open their eyes and exhibit basic orienting responses, but show no conscious, purposeful activity.Reflex and other movements are seen, mediated by brainstem, spinal cord, and brainstem-diencephalic arousal systems (Laureys et al., 2004).VS can occur after patients emerge from an acute catastrophic brain insult causing coma, or can also be seen in degenerative or congenital nervous system disorders.The two common findings are necrosis of the cerebral cortex, thalamus and brainstem (usually after anoxic injury) and diffuse axonal injury (usually after trauma), although other pathological findings can be seen in degenerative and other disorders (Laureys, 2008).The MCS patients do not meet diagnostic criteria for coma or VS because they demonstrate some inconsistent but clear evidence of consciousness (Laureys et al., 2008;Giacino et al., 2002).In the MCS, there is variable impaired function of the cerebral cortex, diencephalons and upper brainstem.This allows occasional conscious behaviours to occur, unlike in VS or coma.Patients may enter the MCS as they emerge from coma or VS, or they can become minimally conscious as a result of acute injury or chronic degenerative diseases.Recent studies suggest a number of potential clinical and rehabilitative applications of magnetic resonance (MR) techniques.Although bedside clinical examination remains the criterion standard for establishing diagnosis, MR may provide an adjunctive diagnostic role when behavioural findings are very limited or ambiguous.The future of diagnostic and prognostic assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) envisions a battery of neurobehavioral and neuroimaging techniques (such as structural and functional MR imaging (MRI and www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging -Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience 182 fMRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), fiber tracking, positron emission tomography (PET)) that serve as complementary clinical tools that may help differentiate the effects of underarousal, sensory impairment, motor dysfunction, and cognitive disturbance in the search for potential causes of behavioural unresponsiveness. Magnetic Resonance and Magnetization Transfer ImagingThe morphological MRI acquisitions usually include non-contrast-enhanced sagittal T1, axial diffusion, axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial T2-SE, coronal T2 sequences and a 3D T1-weighted volume acquisition.FLAIR and T2-SE sequences permit to detect brain edema, contusion, hematoma, herniation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus.T2 sequences are useful in detecting hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injuries (DAI).The total number of lesions detected by FLAIR and T2 are shown to be inversely correlated with Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of traumatic coma patients; while the 3D T1 sequence provides an opportunity to evaluate the brain atrophy during the follow up of these patients.A lot of studies performed on traumatic coma patients with conventional MRI showed that lesions of the pons, midbrain, and basal ganglia were predictive of poor outcome especially when they are bilateral.Despite their encouraging results, these studies fail to explain why some patients in VS or with long-term marked cognitive impairments have no or minimal lesions on conventional MRI examination.This raises the question of the lack of specificity and insufficient sensitivity of conventional MR sequences which fail to reveal lesions such as ischemic axonal injuries.Therefore, it is clear that morphological and conventional MRI alone cannot be considered as a reliable tool to assess consciousness disorders severity or to predict their evolution and outcome (Tshibanda et al., 2009).Several studies investigated patients in VS and in MCS using non-conventional, quantitative and volumetric MR techniques, useful to provide information about the anatomical patterns, the prognosis and the outcome of these patients.Ammermann et al. (2007) have used volumetric analysis of MRI to determine the pattern of lesions in 12 patients with a severe neurological impairment after acute ischemic injury.At the time of scanning, the patients were either in VS or in an early remising state, that is MCS.Lesions were classified as having been present in the gray and/or white matter in four different brain regions (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital).An additional separate evaluation was performed for the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem.The total clinical follow-up period of all patients from the time of the causative event lasted for at least 5 months.The clinical outcomes were reported according to the Rancho Los Amigos Cognitive Scale (RLACS) as a universal guide to assess a patient's level of functioning.The final RLACS levels were correlated to the MRI lesion size with a Spearman correlation.All patients demonstrated extensive white matter lesions, with the largest lesions observed in the frontal and occipital lobe.A preferential involvement of the white matter located in the periventricular area and in the subcortical regions below the motor and internal temporal cortices was found, in addition to the classifically described lesions of the striatum, motor and occipital cortices.Lesion magnitude showed an association with the severity of the outcome as quantitatively assessed by RLACS.With respect to gray matter lesions, the vulnerability pattern observed included frontal and occipital and in some cases parietal cortical areas, moreover in most cases the thalamus.Additionally, almost all of patients showed lesions of the hippocampus or lesions to the basal ganglia.An association between the extent of the MRI defined lesions located within the white matter and the clinical www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State 183 outcomes of the patients was found.All patients in the most unfavorable class III clinical outcome group (i.e.persistent VS) exhibited white matter lesions exceeding 2/3 of the volume of at least one lobe, most frequently the occipital lobe.Moreover, Juengling et al. ( 2005) investigated 5 patients in persistent VS due to prolonged cerebral hypoxia of non-traumatic origin, using combined Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) of 3D MRI and FDG-PET analysis.In the analysis of the regional distribution of gray matter atrophy, VBM revealed multiple areas of significantly decreased gray matter density at p<.001, corrected for multiple comparisons.Those were localized in multiple cortical areas, in particular including inferior parietal lobe, superior and medial frontal lobe, paracentral lobule, superior and medial temporal lobe, the cingulum, and the fusiform gyrus.Thalamic changes were limited to small voxel clusters in dorso-medial areas.These structural atrophic changes were compared with the local distribution of functional loss as assessed by regional hypometabolism in the FDG-PET group analysis.At the threshold pb0.001 (corrected for multiple comparisons), PET showed a widespread pattern of hypometabolic areas.In particular, the parietal and frontotemporal cortices, the cuneus/precuneus, the cingulum, the frontal medial and precentral gyrus, and the transverse temporal gyrus were involved, additionally the bilateral thalamus (mainly dorsomedial subnucleus).All changes were, similar to the VBM results, nearly symmetrical.Improved understanding of this complex lesion pattern gained by in vivo group analyses like here might help to provide deeper insights into the general pathoanatomy of patients in the persistent VS.Using high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and a novel approach to shape analysis applied SIENAX software, Fernandez-Espejo et al. ( 2010) investigated thalamic global and regional changes in a sample of patients in a VS or an MCS.They found that total thalamic volume was significantly lower in patients than in healthy volunteers.Shape analysis revealed significant bilateral regional atrophy in the dorso-medial body in patients compared to controls; this atrophy was more widespread in VS than in MCS patients.Lower thalamic volume was significantly correlated with worsening of Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores.Shape analysis suggested that the dorso-medial nucleus and the internal medullar lamina were the main regions responsible for this correlation.These findings suggest that MCS and VS patients present different patterns of regional thalamic abnormalities.In particular, VS patients showed a more widespread pattern of atrophy than controls, producing differences in global thalamic volume.MCS patients did not show volumetric differences compared to controls, and regionally they showed a less pronounced inward collapse in both the dorsal and ventral areas, with the anterior-ventral body significantly spared.Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that thalamic damage is less common in MCS than in VS patients (Jennett et al., 2001).Another quantitative RM technique is the Magnetization Transfer Imaging (MTI).The MTI relies on the principle that protons bound in structures exhibit T1 relaxation coupling with protons in the aqueous phase.When an off-resonance saturation pulse is applied, it selectively saturates those protons that are bound in macromolecules.These protons subsequently exchange longitudinal magnetization with free water protons, leading to a reduction in the detected signal intensity (Sinson et al., 2001).The MTI may provide a quantitative index of the structural integrity of tissue and might be useful to study the outcome of patients with low levels of consciousness.However, further studies, on larger groups of patients, need to be performed to confirm the usefulness of quantitative MRI in the assessment of the eventual neurological prognosis and outcome of these challenging patients.",

Within little more than a decade, the subject which was thought to be associated with relatively few conditions, such as mongolism, cretinism, microcephaly and the like, has been shown by medical, genetical and psychiatric research to be significantly related to about 70 conditions. It is possible to arrange a list of these conditions, not necessarily complete, under three basic headings for the purpose of description: subcultural defects, instability defects and somatic defects. Subcultural defectives are characterized by intellectual inadequacy paralleled by a lower level of social development; unstable defectives are characterized by abnormal rather than subnormal conduct and may be of the psychopathic, the epileptic or the exogenous type. Somatic defects are distinguished ordinarily",

Puede generar déficit notables en funciones psicológicas importantes como la ejecutiva, la atención o la memoria y evolucionar hasta un cuadro de pseudodemencia susceptible de mejorar con tratamiento antidepresivo.Objetivo: describir el funcionamiento de la memoria explícita en el trastorno depresivo mayor. Materiales y métodos: se hizo una búsqueda en la base de datos PUBMED con las palabras clave “major depression” (depresión mayor), “explicit memory” (memoria explícita) y “recollection memory” (memoria de recolección); se tomaron los artículos publicados después del año 2000; adicionalmente se incluyó bibliografía científica relevante para el cumplimiento del objetivo. Desarrollo: en la neuroanatomía del trastorno depresivo mayor se encuentran implicadas redes fronto-subcorticales (como las áreas prefrontales, tálamo, ganglios basales, hipocampo, entre otras). Estas estructuras pueden presentar atrofias que explicarían la persistencia o cronicidad de algunos de los síntomas cognitivos de la depresión. Las alteraciones en la memoria explícita, declarativa o de recolección, son de particular importancia por ser las más frecuentemente encontradas en sujetos con uno o más episodios depresivos mayores, y la estructura cerebral que se ha correlacionado más directamente con alteraciones en el almacenamiento de la memoria explícita es el hipocampo. Se ha observado actividad continua de neurogénesis en el hipocampo de animales adultos, la cual es especialmente susceptible cuando hay exposición prolongada a situaciones de estrés grave. Esto se evidencia en estudios que han encontrado reducido su volumen en sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor, en comparación con individuos sanos. De todas maneras, aunque no se encuentre una reducción marcada del volumen, se sugiere que hay una alteración de su funcionamiento.Conclusiones: la memoria explícita es un proceso psicológico con base biológica precisa, cuya estructura y funcionamiento se alteran en presencia de una condición menos precisa como la depresión mayor.",

The symptoms in melancholia being of a negative character due to a lowering or suspension of brain activity, we do not look for all those diversities, endless varieties and aspects which we may find in mania, be it simple, acute, or chronic. Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view. If this increased activity does not rapidly terminate in resolution, one of two things must occur—either exhaustion or atrophy, resulting in death or dementia, will supervene, or abnormal tissue will invade or replace healthy nerve paths or areas, and chronic aberration of mind ensue.",

Multiple studies have reported drug-induced RLS caused by antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiepileptic medications. Risk factors for drug-induced RLS include older age, gastrointestinal diseases, high medication dose, simultaneous use of ≥2 drugs. The mechanism of drug-induced RLS is most often associated with the effect of medications on various receptors and neurotransmitter systems, in particular, the dopamine system. Drug-induced RLS treatment includes identification and withdrawal of a drug that caused RLS or a decrease in its dosage. Prevention of drug-induced RLS is based on compliance with the principles of rational pharmacotherapy.Синдром беспокойных ног (СБН) — сенсомоторное расстройство, которое характеризуется движением ног во время периодов отдыха или бездействия, облегчается при движении и наиболее ярко проявляется вечером или ночью.

К факторам риска развития ЛИСБН относят пожилой возраст, курение, злоупотребление кофеином и алкоголем, заболевания желудочно-кишечного тракта, высокие дозы препаратов, одновременное применение двух препаратов и более. Механизм развития ЛИСБН связывается с действием лекарственных средств на различные рецепторы и нейромедиаторные системы, особенно дофаминергические.

Autonomic outflow is organized neuroanatomically and functionally.

Knowledge of autonomic physiology is key to the recognition and diagnosis of autonomic failure, orthostatic hypotension, autonomic neuropathies, localizable regional autonomic disorders, neurodegenerative and general medical disorders that affect autonomic function. An important example is neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, which can result from impaired sympathetic vasoconstriction of peripheral vascular beds, impaired carotid baroreflex responses, or impaired autonomic influence on cardiac output. Another example is thermoregulatory failure from ineffective cutaneous sudomotor or vasomotor responses. Accurate measurement and valid interpretation of autonomic responses in the clinical laboratory rest on an understanding of autonomic physiology.",

      "abstract": "Ocular neuropathic pain is a diagnosis of exclusion which refers to the heightened perception of pain in response to normally non-painful stimuli. It usually presents without any visible objective exam findings, making it extremely difficult to identify. For this reason, it often gets misdiagnosed as dry eye disease.Ocular neuropathic pain may present with accompanying visible damage to tissue; however, it can also occur as a result of a physiological dysfunction of the nervous system. With other corneal pathologies, the intensity of corneal pain often correlates with vital dye staining. However, in patients with ocular neuropathic pain, symptoms are severe and unaccompanied by equivalent signs, which is why ocular neuropathic pain is sometimes referred to as “corneal pain without stain” or “phantom cornea.” This is the ocular analog of complex regional pain syndrome, systemic neuropathic pain, or reflex sympathetic dystrophy.Other names for this condition include, but are not limited to corneal neuropathic pain, corneal neuralgia, ocular pain syndrome, keratoneuralgia, corneal neuropathic disease, and corneal allodynia.Ocular neuropathic pain is an important differential to consider because many patients get misdiagnosed due to its significant overlap with dry eye disease. The disparity between signs and symptoms often results in patients being dismissed or considered malingering, hysterical, or psychosomatic. As demonstrated by case reports, patients with extreme cases of this condition have even committed to suicide due to the severity of chronic pain. An important first step in treating ocular neuropathic pain is to communicate the belief that the condition and the symptoms are real.The objective of this article is to provide a summary of the condition and review approaches for its treatment and management, as well as increase awareness of this underrecognized disease.",

      "title": "[Occupational toxic neuropathies: morphology in peripheral nerve biopsies].",
      "abstract": "Many peripheral neuropathies are caused by the (acute or chronic) toxic action of metals, solvents, pesticides, and other occupational and environmental contaminants. These agents often reproduce the anatomoclinical pictures of hereditary (e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), autoimmune (Guillain-Barrè syndrome), or dysmetabolic (thiamine deficiency, diabetic neuropathy) forms. Toxic peripheral neuropathies can be classified on the basis of etiology, clinical features (sensitive, motor, sensitive-motor), or histopathology: neuronopathies (uncommon, mostly secondary to retrograde axonal degeneration; e.g., arsenic, thallium), axonopathies (acrylamide, esacarbons, CS2, organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy), myelinopathies (trichloroethylene), mixed forms (axonal and demyelinating: lead). For many substances, experimental research has led to the identification of the molecular and cellular targets of neurotoxicity. Several compounds are active by biotransformation (e.g., the esacarbons n-hexane and MnBK are neurotoxic since they are metabolized to 2,5-hexanedione), Genetic, physiological and environmental factors determine the individual metabolic set-up, and they may give origin to differences in the workers' sensitivity. Cessation of exposure is often followed by (microscopically observable) regenerative phenomena and clinical improvement. The morphology of neuropathies can be studied through peripheral nerve biopsy. Samples of sural nerve (or other nervous trunks of the limbs), adequately fixed, sectioned, and stained, allow the observation of alterations in axonal fibres (e.g., giant-axonal neuropathy, dying back neuropathy), myelin (demyelination), Schwann cells, interstitium, and blood vessels; possible inflammatory infiltrates; fibre density; regenerative phenomena (growth cone, remyelination). In occupational medicine, biopsy is indicated when the anamnestic-clinical picture, laboratory tests, and instrumental exams leave doubts about the nature, type, and entity of the neurological damage. In such cases, current optical and electron microscopy techniques can be very useful for injury evaluation, prognosis, and follow-up.",

Neuropathic pain, or pain associated with disease or injury to the peripheral or central nervous system, is a common symptom of a heterogeneous group of conditions, including diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, postherpetic neuralgia and spinal cord injury. Chronic neuropathic pain should not be thought of as a symptom. It should truly be thought of as a disease with a very complicated pathophysiology. Pathophysiology. The mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain are complex and involve both peripheral and central pathophysiologic phenomenon. The underlying dysfunction may involve deafferentation within the peripheral nervous system (e.g. neuropathy), deafferentation within the central nervous system (e.g. post-thalamic stroke) or an imbalance between the two (e.g. phantom limb pain). Clinical characteristics. Neuropathic pain is non-nociceptive, in contrast to acute nociceptive pain, and it can be described as ?burning?, ?electric?, ?tingling?, and ?shooting? in nature. Treatment. Rational polypharmacy is often necessary and actually it is almost always the rule. It would be an exception if a patient was completely satisfied with his treatment. Treatment goals should include understanding that our patients may need to be titrated and managed with more than one agent and one type of treatment. There should be the balance of safety, efficacy, and tolerability. Conclusion. There are many new agents and new applications of the existing agents being currently studied which will most certainly lead to even more improved ways of managing this very complicated set of disorders.",

      "abstract": "Article Abstract A diagnosis of bipolar disorder is difficult to make when a depressed patient can provide no evidence of having experienced mania or hypomania, either because the elevated mood states are not recognized as periods of illness or because depression is the initial episode and the patient has yet to experience the other polarity of the disorder. In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

      "abstract": "Reasons: Schizophrenia is typically an adult neurodevelopmental disorder that has its antecedents in childhood and adolescence. Little is known about disorders “usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood and adolescence” (e.g., childhood-onset disorders) in “prodromal” teens at heightened clinical risk for psychotic disorder. Main Findings: Childhood-onset disorders were prevalent in putatively prodromal teens, including anxiety and disruptive disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and, surprisingly, elimination disorders. These may reflect developmental antecedents in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Key Data and Statistics: A case series of 9 teens (ages 13–17) identified as prodromal to psychosis were evaluated with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia–Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL). Childhood-onset diagnoses commonly endorsed (threshold or subthreshold) included ADHD (5/9), oppositional defiant disorder (5/9), enuresis or encopresis (4/9), conduct disorder (2/9), separation anxiety (3/9), and transient tic disorder (2/9). Enuresis was identified in 3 of the 4 older teens (ages 15–17). Major Conclusions: An understanding of the childhood-onset disorders that occur in teens at risk for psychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia, can shed light on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and potentially inform early identification and intervention.",

Chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia have been more extensively researched than most other FSS which has led to specific pathophysiological mechanisms being advanced for each. There is limited data on the predisposing and precipitating factors in FSS. A history of childhood abuse is more common in those who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia. Cognitive behavioural therapy and exercise therapy appear to lead to therapeutic change by tackling biological and psychosocial factors, whilst centrally acting drugs such as antidepressants can sometimes be helpful. For many of the less well recognized FSS, operationalized diagnostic criteria are lacking, as are high quality treatment trials.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological, clinical and neurobiological studies of the last 30 years suggest that traumatic attachments during the early years of life (developmental trauma) cause a specific vulnerability to psychopathological developments based on dissociative pathogenic processes that interferes … Dissociative processes are manifested in various symptoms: arousal dysregulation, dissociative detachment (dissociation of consciousness: e.g. depersonalization), dissociative compartmentalization (dissociation among ego states), somatoform symptoms (somatoform dissociation), emotional and behavioral regulation difficulties and severe interpersonal problems. In adult clinical populations dissociative processes and the related symptoms may either contribute to the genesis of well-defined disorders such as dissociative, borderline and complex post-traumatic, or variably occur in many other DSM or ICD diagnostic categories complicating their clinical pictures and worsening the prognosis. The clinical complexity of developmental trauma requires specific training to enable mental health professionals to recognize the signs of traumatic developments and to implement specific treatment strategies. Besides an introductory overview of the literature on clinical problems and treatment strategies for the sequels in adulthood of developmental trauma, this paper offers an outline on three issues on the adult outcome of developmental trauma and its therapy: the role of disorganized attachment, the need to distinguish disintegrative and dissociative pathogenic processes and the usefulness of traumatic-dissociative psychopathological dimension for clinical reasoning of the contributions of attachment theory and research to the developmental psychopathology of adult disorders related to cumulative traumas in childhood.",

This dysfunction relates to various aspects of perception of emotional states in oneself and in others, but also applies to complex situations such as social communication. The majority of evidence supports a theory that patients with MDD show a negative bias towards ambiguous emotional information in all domains of social perception. It appears that social cognitive function varies in the course of MDD due to treatment and symptom severity. Therefore, social cognitive dysfunction often presents as a subtle phenomenon vulnerable to further disturbing influences by confounding variables. Analyses often do not consider important confounders such as symptom severity and type of treatment. Social cognitive research uses a broad spectrum of measurements with varying quality of standard psychometric criteria. Future investigations should use standardized measures with large normative samples to avoid distortions of results.",

      "abstract": "The concept of hysteria or conversion disorder, firmly anchored in psychoanalytic theory, postulates the emergence of physical symptoms as an unconscious attempt to resolve a painful psychic conflict. The advantages accruing from the adoption of the sick role contribute to perpetuate the disability. Two major problems with this concept have detracted from its clinical value. The first is the difficulty in establishing the occurrence, relevance and timing of a \\`sufficient' psychological stressor. The second is to distinguish \\`unconscious' motivation from feigning. Faced with these difficulties and threatened by the fear of missing treatable neurological conditions, clinicians have opted for a diagnosis by exclusion, invoking conversion disorder only after detailed investigations have failed to find an alternative explanation for the symptoms. The advent of telemetry and non-invasive imaging and the better characterization of some neurological disorders (e.g. the dystonias) have made it possible to diagnose as neurological hitherto `unexplained' symptoms. Future advances will, no doubt, help to explain others, but there is strong evidence to suggest that for a core of symptoms the diagnosis of hysteria or conversion disorder will remain valid. The strongest evidence comes from follow-up studies of carefully investigated patients (Binzer and Kullgren, 1998; Crimlisk et al ., 1998) for whom conversion disorder is a stable diagnosis and not the harbinger of unsuspected neurological disease. …",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

      "title": "Chronic Fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis: Are both conditions on the same continuum?",
      "abstract": "Overlap exists between several functional somatic illnesses like chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), multiple chemical sensitivity and myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Recently, researchers suggested that these entities are due to similar mechanisms with possible differences in symptom clusters. For instance, post-exertional malaise and impairment of memory and attention are essential for the ME but are not required in the CFS although symptom clusters only differ in severity. This study compares 26 ME patients and 41 CFS patients regarding cognitive problems and functionality using standardized objective test batteries instead of self-reported measures. Should no distinct features emerge, then ME could merge in the continuum CFS. No differences were found regarding functional status although ME patients reported more general fatigue. ME patients have more attention problems whereas CFS patients show more memory difficulties and a slower reaction time. Our results do not fully support the research for ME. These differences could be more helpful in delineating a continuum instead of supporting distinct conditions. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) still evokes controversy in the medical literature. There may be several reasons for this. First, many different case definitions create heterogeneity not amenable to meta-analysis (Van Hoof et al., 2003). Second, clinicians become entangled because of the different possible ways to define its context. For instance, in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), CFS is classified as a neurological condition (G93.3) but when using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), CFS is called undifferentiated somatoform disorder or neurasthenia (F48.0). Finally, overlapping diagnoses occur among many conditions including CFS, Fibromyalgia, multiple chemical sensitivity, myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), rheumatoid arthritis, and irritable bowel syndrome. This overlap suggest that these 'functional somatic illnesses' may be variants of one another. Several researchers have already suggested that these entities are due to similar if not identical mechanisms (Bruno et al., 1998; Buchwald et al., 1994; Donnay & Ziem, 1999; Hudson et al., 1992; Miller, 1999). The different conditions are thought to vary in the severity and the chronicity of complaints, producing distinct entities. According to the 1994 CFS criteria, a patient is required to experience chronic fatigue of a new or definite onset (for 6 or more months) that is not substantially alleviated by rest, is not the result of ongoing exertion, and produces significant reductions in occupational, social or personal activities. The Fukuda et al. (Fukuda et al., 1994) also require the concurrent presence of at least 4 of 8 other symptoms: Self-reported persistent or recurrent impairment in short-term memory or concentration resulting in previous levels of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities; sore throat; tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes; muscle pain; multiple joint pain; headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity; unrefreshing sleep; and post exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours. Conversely, many patients, especially in Britain, prefer the term myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) rather than the term CFS. The term ME refers to an underlying medical cause. Subsequently, the stigma associated with CFS is not present. The include (a) fatigue after minimal exertion (not daily fatigue) and delay of recovery of muscle power after exertion and, (b) 1 or more symptoms that indicate circulatory impairment, (c) 1 or more symptoms that indicate central nervous system involvement (cerebral problems), and (d) fluctuating symptoms (Ramsay, 1981; Ramsay, 1988). In 1992, Goudsmit and colleagues developed the criteria for research on ME. The London include (a) exercise-induced fatigue caused by small amounts of exertion (physical or mental) compared to previously tolerated levels, (b) neurological disturbances, especially impaired memory and concentration, (c) fluctuation of symptoms, and (d) the requirement for the ongoing presence of these symptoms for at least 6 months (National Task Force, 1994). …",

      "title": "Meniere Disease-diagnosis and Management",
      "abstract": "Meniere disease (MD) is characterized by the classic triad of symptoms (episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss) is likely caused by endolymphatic hydrops of the labyrinthine system of the inner ear.The course of MD is variable.Some patients experience progressive hearing loss with infrequent vestibular symptoms; some have severe and frequent vertigo with only mild auditory symptoms; and some manifest both auditory and vestibular symptoms in equal measure. Most patients tend to cycle from active symptoms to prolonged remissions. A clinical diagnosis of MD is made based upon the following criteria: Two or more spontaneous episodes of vertigo, each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours Audiometrically documented low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear Fluctuating aural symptoms (reduced or distorted hearing, tinnitus, or fullness) in the affected ear Symptoms not better accounted for by another vestibular diagnosis Although audiometric testing is a required part of the diagnostic evaluation, there is no specific diagnostic test for MD. A variety of other conditions can present with symptoms similar to MD and are often considered in the differential diagnosis.The conditions include vestibular migraine, vestibular schwannoma, multiple sclerosis (MS), transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and Cogan syndrome. Dietary and lifestyle modifications for all patients – As initial therapy for all patients with MD, (Grade 2C).If other triggers are identified (eg, nicotine, stress, monosodium glutamate [MSG]), these should also be avoided. Dietary and lifestyle modifications should be continued indefinitely Vestibular rehabilitation for persistent disequilibrium – For patients with MD and persistent disequilibrium symptoms between attacks, we suggest referral for vestibular rehabilitation therapy (Grade 2C).Although vestibular rehabilitation does not reduce the frequency of vertigo attacks, the exercise activities maximize balance and central nervous system (CNS) compensation for disequilibrium symptoms.Vestibular rehabilitation has no role in the treatment of acute vertigo due to MD. Pharmacotherapy for refractory symptoms – For all patients with MD with refractory symptoms and poor quality of life despite dietary and lifestyle interventions,we suggest the use of pharmacotherapy rather than no pharmacotherapy (Grade 2C). Betahistine and diuretics are the two options for pharmacologic therapy to reduce the severity and intensity of MD attacks. We suggest treatment with betahistine rather than diuretics, when available (Grade 2C). Acute episodes of vertigo should be managed with vestibular suppressants and antiemetics if necessary. Glucocorticoid therapy (systemic or intratympanic) for persistent symptoms – Among all patients with refractory symptoms severe enough to require further treatment beyond dietary changes, lifestyle adjustment, and first-line pharmacotherapy, there is no widely accepted agreement upon which treatment is preferred. However, we suggest treatment with glucocorticoids rather than other therapies for these patients (Grade 2C). For the majority of patients with MD and refractory, disabling vertigo symptoms despite first-line treatments, we treat with a limited course of oral glucocorticoids. For patients with MD with disabling vertigo symptoms despite first-line treatments, and in whom oral glucocorticoid therapy is contraindicated, or who through shared decision-making prefer intratympanic therapy with intratympanic glucocorticoids. Additional treatment options for patients refractory to glucocorticoid therapy – For patients with refractory MD symptoms and continued poor quality of life despite treatment with glucocorticoids (systemic or intratympanic),additional treatments are offered depending on the degree of labyrinthine function (severity of vertigo attacks and the degree of disequilibrium between attacks) and the level of hearing loss to determine the most appropriate management for an individual patient. For MD patients with preserved hearing,treatment with endolymphatic sac procedures (including decompression and/or shunting) or sacculotomy is offered; if this is unsuccessful,we typically then offer treatment with intratympanic gentamycin. For patients with MD with complete hearing loss in the affected ear, we suggest treatment with IT gentamycin rather than labyrinthectomy (Grade 2C). Labyrinthectomy is generally reserved for those patients who have disabling symptoms that persist despite treatment with intratytmpanic gentamicin.",

For the neurologist, specific questions about a prior neurologic history such as Parkinson’s disease, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, epilepsy, or the possibility of narcolepsy should be asked. Syncope and seizures are not always clearly distinguished, and guidance is provided.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, and verbal and nonverbal communication as well as limited and repetitive behaviours. Although symptomatology of autism may be noticed around early months, diagnosis generally occurs around 24-36 months, however in some cases diagnosis may be delayed to adulthood [1]. Since behavioural symptoms and the degree of functional impairment are variable, the au‐ tistic disorder is described as a heterogenous symptom cluster of varying etiological and pathological basis [2]. Described as a multifactorial disorder created by interaction of neuro‐ logic, immunologic, environmental, and genetic factors, autistic disorder has no definite cause [3, 4]. In many cases in whom the etiology remains unclear are diagnosed as idiopath‐ ic autism or non-syndromic autism [5, 6]. Seventy percent of cases with idiopathic autism have basic symptoms without physical abnormalities whereas 30% have complex autism in which dysmorphic features are detected such as microcephaly and/or structural brain mal‐ formations [7]. Autism is associated with other syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome, Down Syndrome, and tuberosclerosis in 5-25% of the cases ([8, 9]. Although phenotypic het‐ erogeneity is the biggest challenge for research efforts directed to identify autism etiology [10], currently it is widely accepted that environmental and genetic factors play essential role in genesis of autistic disorder thanks to a recent advance in research techniques related to biological factors and widespread studies in this field [11, 12].",

In other instances, especially when the discharges are more atypical, the psychic disturbances may take on the character of either a simple worsening of behavior or of a confusional state with agitation and delirium, or of a stuporous state. The temporal lobe statuses, which are much more rare, manifest themselves either as a succession of psychomotor attacks, or as protracted confusional or confusooneiric episodes. An EEG makes it possible, at any rate, to differentiate between the petit mal statuses and the temporal lobe statuses.

      "abstract": "Contemporary neuroscience and psychiatry are currently experiencing a rapid evolution. The foundations of these relatively new sciences are still largely theoretical and speculative. There are many competing hypotheses regarding the etiology and pathogenesis of mental illness. Unlike most somatic pathology, there is not a single laboratory test or objective disease marker for any psychiatric disorders. One of the dominant etiological paradigms in psychiatry involves the functional levels of neurotransmitters. Even this assumption is mootable, untestable, and widely disputed.\r\nSeveral psychiatric disorders - Depression, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, Traumatic Brian Injury, Autism, Parkinson’s disease, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder are associated with a dysregulation of immune responses and measurably increased inflammatory markers.\r\nThere is an empirical correlation of an over-activated immune system with the development of psychiatric symptomatology. By experimentally inducing systemic inflammation, cognition and behavior are adversely affected. By experimentally suppressing inflammation, sensorium and mood can be dramatically improved.\r\nAnti-inflammatory agents such as NSAIDS (COX-2 inhibitors), low-dose Aspirin (COX-1 inhibitors), and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (Omega-3 Fatty Acids) have demonstrated effectiveness – sometimes surpassing first-line psychotropic medications – in reducing psychiatric symptomatology.\r\nIt has also been demonstrated that some antidepressant and antipsychotic medications exert measurable immune modulation and anti-inflammatory effects. This may in part explain some of their therapeutic actions further challenging the theoretical foundation of the neurotransmitter hypothesis.\r\nThe notion of neuroinflammation is opening the door to a groundbreaking scientific endeavor. There is even a debate among these trailblazing scientists about what to call this promising and emerging field; Immunopsychiatry or Psychoneuroimmunology.\r\nA conspicuous question is then raised as to whether inflammation causes mental impairment or does psychiatric pathology induce inflammation? Is inflammation the chicken or the egg? This is an exciting new frontier in psychiatry. It will offer promising novel targets for treatment and new avenues for therapeutic innovation.",

      "title": "Overview: Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "Summary An disorder is marked by extremes. It is present when a person experiences severe disturbances in behavior, such as extreme reduction of food intake or extreme overeating, or feelings of extreme distress or concern about body weight or shape. A person with an disorder may have started out just smaller or larger amounts of food than usual, but at some point, the urge to eat less or more spirals out of control. Eating disorders are very complex, and despite scientific research to understand them, the biological, behavioral and social underpinnings of these illnesses remain elusive. The two main types of disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. A third category is eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS), which includes several variations of disorders. Eating disorders frequently appear during adolescence or young adulthood, but some reports indicate that they can develop during childhood or later in adulthood. Women and girls are much more likely than males to develop an disorder. Men and boys account for an estimated 5 to 15 percent of patients with anorexia or bulimia and an estimated 35 percent of those with binge-eating disorder. Eating disorders are real, treatable medical illnesses with complex underlying psychological and biological causes. They frequently co-exit with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety disorders. People with disorders also can suffer from numerous other physical health complications, such as heart conditions or kidney failure, which can lead to death.",

      "abstract": "[ES]Las enfermedades neurologicas son trastornos del cerebro, la medula espinal y nervios del cuerpo, en conjunto conocidos como sistema nervioso. Todas las funciones motoras, cognitivas y sensitivas estan controladas por estos organos, cuando alguno de estos componentes del sistema nervioso falla aparecen alteraciones en el habla y la actividad: motora, respiratoria, cognitiva, etc. Existen mas de 600 tipos de enfermedades neurologicas descritas, las mas comunes son debidas a anomalias geneticas, alteraciones en el desarrollo del sistema nervioso, enfermedades degenerativas, ictus cerebrales, lesiones medulares, etc. Una de las actividades motoras que se ve mayormente afectada en estas patologias es la marcha. La marcha se produce como resultado de la coordinacion de diversos sistemas musculares. Numerosos estudios han demostrado que los pacientes con determinados trastornos neurologicos tienen modificados los patrones normales de la marcha como consecuencia de la alteracion de la actividad contractil, de la fuerza de los musculos que intervienen, o de la coordinacion que debe existir entre ellos. El interes de estudiar los mecanismos de la marcha y las alteraciones de los mismos, reside en la utilidad como herramienta para el diagnostico del retraso motor y neurologico de los pacientes. En este trabajo pretendemos valorar la eficacia de la terapia de la Locomocion Refleja de Vojta como un novedoso metodo rehabilitador de los patrones anormales de la marcha en pacientes con patologias neurologicas de diversa indole. A traves de la aplicacion de la terapia Vojta, activamos en el paciente determinadas funciones musculares de forma inconsciente, necesarias para la motricidad espontanea. Segun la literatura la activacion repetida de dichos movimientos reflejos en el paciente conduce a la liberacion o generacion de circuitos nerviosos bloqueados funcionalmente entre el cerebro y la medula espinal, activando mecanismos de plasticidad neuronal. Hemos observado que con la aplicacion de la terapia Vojta se han conseguido grandes cambios funcionales en cortos periodos de tiempo. Con este trabajo queremos corroborar la importancia de la aplicacion clinica de este metodo rehabilitador. Esta linea de investigacion puede tener un valor teorico anadido creando nuevas ideas o expectativas en el campo de la investigacion basica para responder cuestiones como, ?que mecanismos medulares se reactivan con esta terapia? ?Que circuitos superiores estan implicados? ?Esta la terapia modulando la neurogenesis?",

There are, however, no actually observed cases recorded in the medical literature which clearly indicate that extended vigils produce either mental disease or death. Normal sleep is disturbed in various organic conditions of the central nervous system, such as encephalitis, meningitis, concussion and dementia paralytica, as well as in the functional psychoses, in manic-depressive psychosis and in schizophrenia. This demonstrates clearly that an intact nervous system does",

Complex consciousness, including cognition, perception, and memory, under conditions such as cardiac arrest and general anesthesia, when it cannot be associated with normal brain function, requires a revised cosmology anchored not in 19th-century classical physics but rather in 21st-century quantum physics that includes consciousness in its conceptual formulation. Classical physics, anchored in materialist reductionism, offered adequate descriptions of everyday mechanics but ultimately proved insufficient for describing the mechanics of extremely high speeds or small sizes, and was supplemented a century ago by quantum physics. Materialist psychology, modeled on the reductionism of classical physics, likewise offered adequate descriptions of everyday mental functioning but ultimately proved insufficient for describing mentation under extreme conditions, such as the continuation of mental function when the brain is inactive or impaired, such as occurs near death.",

Mild neurocognitive disorder is evidence of one or more cognitive deficits without loss of independent functioning. Cognitive impairment in chronic kidney disease is related to vascular and nonvascular mechanisms leading to microvascular injury, and white matter loss and microinfarction. Neurocognitive impairment is multifactorial in chronic kidney disease. End-stage kidney disease and the actual process of dialysis can potentiate cerebral vascular changes including volume and electrolyte shifts and related dialysis disequilibrium. Cognitive testing is an important component of the clinical assessment to corroborate the history. There is little or no randomized controlled trial evidence for cognitive rehabilitation or remediation among children or adults with chronic kidney disease. Neurocognitive disorders in adults with chronic kidney disease alter decision-making about dialysis treatment and reduce self-care dialysis.",

      "title": "The clinical characteristics of dementia with Lewy bodies and a consideration of prodromal diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common type of degenerative dementia following Alzheimer’s disease (AD). DLB is clinically and pathologically related to Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD dementia, and the three disorders can be viewed as existing on a spectrum of Lewy body disease. In recent years there has been a concerted effort to establish the phenotypes of AD and PD in the prodromal phase (before the respective syndromes of cognitive and motor impairment are expressed). Evidence for the prodromal presentation of DLB is also emerging. This paper briefly reviews what is known about the clinical presentation of prodromal DLB before discussing the pathology of Lewy body disease and how this relates to potential biomarkers of prodromal DLB. The presenting features of DLB can be broadly placed in three categories: cognitive impairment (particularly nonamnestic cognitive impairments), behavioural/psychiatric phenomena (for example, hallucinations, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD)) and physical symptoms (for example, parkinsonism, decreased sense of smell, autonomic dysfunction). Some noncognitive symptoms such as constipation, RBD, hyposmia and postural dizziness can predate the onset of memory impairment by several years in DLB. Pathological studies of Lewy body disease have found that the earliest sites of involvement are the olfactory bulb, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve, the peripheral autonomic nervous system, including the enteric nervous system, and the brainstem. Some of the most promising early markers for DLB include the presence of RBD, autonomic dysfunction or hyposmia, 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine cardiac scintigraphy, measures of substantia nigra pathology and skin biopsy for α-synuclein in peripheral autonomic nerves. In the absence of disease-modifying therapies, the diagnosis of prodromal DLB is of limited use in the clinic. That said, knowledge of the prodromal development of DLB could help clinicians identify cases of DLB where the diagnosis is uncertain. Prodromal diagnosis is of great importance in research, where identifying Lewy body disease at an earlier stage may allow researchers to investigate the initial phases of dementia pathophysiology, develop treatments designed to interrupt the development of the dementia syndrome and accurately identify the patients most likely to benefit from these treatments.",

Mada / Madonmada is caused by various traumatic events or extreme stressors, and it is characterized by various features such as pradhyayati (immersed in thoughts/flashbacks/recurrent or persistent distressing thoughts), praswapati (excessive sleep), animittitam rodati (crying without any reason/pervasive negative emotions/depressed mood), akasmaat hasati (laughing inappropriately or without any reason/disorganized behavior), nidraalu (hypersomnia/excessive sleep), alpa vaak (diminished speech or poverty of speech/social withdrawal), nityam utsuka (hypervigilant/restlessness), trasta shareeri (tiredness/weakness), deenaaksha (depression/pervasive negative emotions), krodhana (angry outbursts/irritable behavior), nirapatrapa (self-destructive behavior/recklessness), purastaat avalokee (exaggerated startle response), na yathavritta eva (disorganized or abnormal behavior), parushatva of roma (roughness or dryness of skin and hair), and aavilam chakshusha (confused/teary eyes). Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

Desarrollo y conclusiones. El SLK es un sindrome epileptico raro con fenotipo clinico-EEG bien establecido -agnosia auditiva con crisis epilepticas, en un alto porcentaje, de buen pronostico, otros trastornos neuropsicologicos, y EEG con punta onda continua en sueno lento (POCSL)- y una etiopatogenia no bien delimitada. La mayoria de los casos son criptogenicos y en pocos casos se han encontrado agentes causales diversos, destacando entre ellos microdisgenesias corticales. La afasia de recepcion esta originada por las POCSL que ocurren en periodos criticos de la maduracion cerebral, durante la sinaptogenesis cortical bitemporal, cuando se establecen los circuitos funcionales elementales linguisticos. Es probable que haya un factor genetico implicado que, activado por factores medioambientales, desencadene el sindrome. El SLK se relaciona por la edad de comienzo, anomalias del EEG intercritico y activacion por el sueno con otros sindromes que, a veces, se solapan entre ellos, como la epilepsia rolandica y la EPOCSL, con los cuales constituyen un continuo neurobiologico cuya expresion clinica neuropsicologica se relaciona con el punto de partida de las descargas, y la gravedad, con la activacion en sueno. En el diagnostico diferencial con otras afasias adquiridas y TEA, aparte de matices clinicos, a veces claros, los hallazgos del EEG en sueno son definitivos.

Most studies of dementia deal with light to moderate stages of the condition, while relatively little attention has been paid to its most severe stages. This review presents a clinical description of patients with severe dementia and of the tests currently available to evaluate their cognitive, behavioural, and functional status. Available instruments such as the Hierarchic Dementia Scale or the Severe Impairment Battery now allow quantification of the cognitive and behavioural status of patients with severe dementia. Experience with severe dementia shows that, far from being in a `vegetative state', as is commonly thought, late‐stage patients are in fact quite different from one another and in most cases continue to have an interaction with their environment. This ability to better define the characteristics of patients with severe dementia provides the basis for correlations between clinical data and data derived from neuroimaging, neurochemistry, or neuropathology. It also sets the stage for possible therapeutic trials involving these patients.",

We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting.

      "abstract": "Advancing age is often accompanied by complaints of impaired memory and reduced performance on a variety of cognitive tasks, particularly tasks that measure memory. Careful cross-sectional examination of cognitive function among community-dwelling elderly, however, reveals a spectrum of cognitive performance from normal to dementia, including impairments in a variety of cognitive domains in the absence of a clinically defined dementia. Gradual decline in cognitive ability is a characteristic of longitudinal studies of the elderly, consistent with the aging and mental decline hypothesis, but with substantial individual heterogeneity that suggests much of the age-related differences in memory performance may reflect an admixture of incipient dementia within older populations. The possibility that incipient dementia is prevalent amongst the elderly is further supported by neuropathological studies that reveal evidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) years before clinical symptoms are evident. Although less common, AD pathology can also be found in individuals with no detectable symptoms. Finally, AD pathology is often present in individuals with memory impairment who are not demented. Clinical studies of elderly individuals with memory impairment also reveal a rapid rate of conversion to AD, reaching as high as 15% per year. This evidence suggests that significant memory impairment, short of dementia and often denoted as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the elderly may be a transition phase between the normal aging process and AD.",

      "abstract": "Relationships between measures of executive skills and neuropsychiatric and functional status were examined in a group of 31 patients with Alzheimer's disease. Deficits in four executive skills tests were significantly associated with the Agitation/Disinhibition factor score and Total Neuropsychiatric score on the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale, as well as the Activities subscore on the Blessed Dementia Scale. The majority of these associations remained significant after covariance for Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Executive dysfunction is associated with clinically relevant neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional impairment in Alzheimer's disease. These associations may be independent of other cognitive deficits such as memory, language, and visuospatial skills, and may not be appreciated on routine clinical evaluations. Executive skills deficits, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and functional disability may emerge from shared neurobiological mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "SummaryAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of late-life dementia. Significant sleep disturbance is an extremely common complaint in AD, affecting as much as half of clinic-based or community AD cases. Typically sleep disturbance in AD is multi-factorial. The major causes of sleep disruption in dementia include: (1) age-dependent physiological changes that arise as part of normal, 'non-pathological' aging; (2) sleep problems due to medical and psychiatric disorders, and their treatments; (3) primary sleep disorders; (4) poor sleep-related habits and behaviors, often collectively referred to as poor 'sleep hygiene'; or (5) some combination of these factors. The various causes of sleep disturbance in AD are reviewed and 'state-of-the-art' treatments for sleep disturbance in AD are described. Finally, a research agenda is proposed, describing the major research gaps that will need to be filled before a definitive guide to effectively treating sleep disturbances in AD can truly be developed.",

A neuropsychiatric event may precede an SLE diagnosis; therefore, physicians must screen for SLE in patients presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms, if they are not already diagnosed with this condition. For assessing patients with SLE who present with neuropsychiatric symptoms, it is important to first determine whether the symptoms are caused by SLE (primary NPSLE), whether they are a complication of a therapy, or whether they are caused by other comorbidities. Accurate attribution of neuropsychiatric symptoms is vital for selecting therapeutic interventions.",

This chapter discusses key neurological symptoms, including headache, altered mental status, seizures, weakness, sensory symptoms, tremor, visual disturbance, gait abnormality, and speech abnormality. Primary headaches have no identifiable underlying cause whilst secondary headaches have an underlying pathology. Delirium is a more specific term for an acute episode of fluctuating altered mental status. Altered mental status may herald the onset of a life-threatening or of a reversible condition. Symptoms of weakness include difficulty with activity of daily livings or problems with gait and loss of balance. Tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic and oscillatory movement involving one or more body parts. Abnormal gait is when a person is unable to walk in their usual way.",

However, the disease also encompasses many nonmotor issues that can impact a myriad of processes such as cardiovascular status, gastrointestinal function, autonomic function, mood and sleep. These issues can be more debilitating and impactful on health status in part because of a lack of effective treatments. The pathophysiology of the disease process is under active investigation with postulated mechanisms involving both the central nervous system and the periphery. More in depth examination of the many nonmotor symptoms may aid in the discovery of the overarching pathological origin and progression of Parkinson’s disease. Examining the disease process from the perspective of nonmotor symptoms may also provide additional target pathways and potential drug development options not considered previously.

The younger the subjects, however, the wider are the variations. In the first stage of life only massive cerebral lesions afford unquestionable EEG evidence: in evaluating dysrhythmias it is necessary to bear in mind their high incidence in normal subjects. Hence their meaning is to be understood only by prolonged longitudinal studies. The reference here is not only to diffuse or focal slow anomalies, but also to specific pathologic rhythms. The difficulty of interpreting such anomalies is particularly evident when epileptogenic potentials are found, since they may be signs of a lesion but their clinical correlations are uncertain. The concept of \"masked epilepsy\" must be rejected. Only the diagnoses of latent or proven epilepsy are admissible, and these epilepsies may be without direct relationship to the clinical, psychiatric or central nervous findings in the affected subject. Numerous genetic, afferential, emotional or biologic factors are involved in the development of non-lesional disorders. Accordingly, the EEG has only a minor contribution to make in the definition of mild focal or diffuse pathologic anatomy of the brain in the very young subject.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

Muskelkater entsteht durch Mikrotraumata des Sarkolemms und der Sarkomere, und Myalgien u. a. durch Ischämie, lokale Protonenkonzentrations-, Sympathikustonusänderungen oder spezifische metabolische Änderungen der musklären Homöostase. Krampi wiederum werden zumeist neurogen proximal in den Motorneuronanteilen oder in den terminalen intramuskulären Anteilen der efferenten Axone ausgelöst. Oft bleibt die Pathogenese bei diesen neuromuskulären Störungen unentdeckt. Im Kontrast dazu steht die sog. Dekontraktionshemmung oder Relaxationsstörung des myotonen Syndroms. Alle klassischen myotonen Syndrome konnten in den letzten 2 Dekaden molekulargenetisch den Ionenkanalerkrankungen zugeordnet werden.

Nichtsdestotrotz gibt es bis dato keine spezifische medikamentöse Behandlung dieser genannten Störungen und Erkrankungen.

We have found that in some cases it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether neuroleptics have contributed to the cause of an acute medical illness, or if the occurrence of acute medical problems precipitated the signs of neuroleptic toxicity by altering the disposition or the pharmacologic effects of the drugs.",

      "title": "Assessment of nocturia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Patients suffering from nocturia need a thorough medical and surgical history and a focused clinical examination. Baseline investigations required for patients suffering with nocturia include: height and weight to calculate the body mass index; bladder diary, e.g. the ICIQ-Bladder Diary; quality of life questionnaire, e.g. ICIQ-N and ICIQ-NQoL; urinalysis, e.g. ‘dipstick’; flow rate and post-void residual measurement; and biochemical tests, e.g. renal electrolytes. Further urological investigations, such as urodynamics, cystoscopy, or imaging, are not indicated, unless an abnormality is suspected on baseline investigations and after failure of conservative and medical therapy. Patients are usually referred to the urologist for nocturia. However, following a thorough investigation, patients may need to be referred to another specialty. For example, if there is 24-hour polyuria, then the patient should be referred to an endocrinologist; if they have sleep disorders, such sleep apnoea (snoring, respiratory arrests), nocturnal seizures, parasomnias (nocturnal motor and behavioural phenomena), or excessive daytime sleepiness (sleep episodes, imperative sleepiness), then they should be referred for sleep evaluation studies. Similarly, if there are psychological problems, then the patient will need to be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist.",

      "abstract": "Syphilitic Ceremal Tuwuvor.-Among the most interesting examples of syphilitic disease of the brain, are those in which the morbid deposit takes the form of a distinct tumour.The symptoms common to nearly all cerebral tumours, when any symptoms at all are present, are, severe pain in the head, vomiting, and double optic neuritis, the pain being fixed in seat or radiating from one point, but variable in intensity at different times.Cases, however, are on record in which tumours have attained a large size without giving rise to abnormal phenomena of any kind; and, although the concurrence, for any long time, of the three symptoms men- tioned would be almost conclusive of the existence of tumour, the absence of one or other would not necessarily be conclusive to the con- trary.Superadded to these general symptoms may be hemiplegia, motor or sensory, if the central ganglia be involved, or paralysis of indi- vidual nerves if' the tumour be situate at the base of the brain, or con- vulsions if the grey matter of the surface of the hemispheres be affected.The symptom of greatest importance is unquestionably the double optic neuritis; and, as Dr. HughlingsJackson, in particular, has pointed out, it may for some time be the only symptom; or, if not quite alone, it may be associated with symptoms so slight as to have no significance independently of it.We must not wait till vision begins to suffer before examining the eyes.It is with constantly renewed astonishment, notwithstanding the frequent illustrations brought forward by Dr. Jackson, and exhibited to this Society and elsewhere, and my own experience, that I see the ex- tensive changes in the disc compatible with good vision.We are as yet in uncertainty as to the immediate mode of production of optic changes, and of the chain of causation by which they are connected with tumours.It may, perhaps, be taken as certain that one way in which changes in the optic disc are produced is by increased intracranial pressure; and it appears probable, moreover, that this intracranial pressure operates through fluid being forced along the sheath of the optic nerve between its two layers, which bulges out the sheath near the eye, and compresses the nerve and its vessels.But the optic changes may be entirely absent, or having appeared may subside, when we have every reason to suppose, from examination after death, that intracranial pressure must have ex- isted; and they may be present when we can see no cause of intracranial pressure.If the existence of fluid in a position to be carried into the optic sheath be a condition required for the production of strangulation of the nerve, the absence of effusion in the membranes at the base of the brain may explain some cases in which optic changes have not appeared.But it is riot even a settled point whether there is, or is not, a distinction between ischremia of the disc, a vascular strangulation or obstruction due to intracranial pressure, and neuritis descendens, an inflammation propagated to the disc by the continuity of the neurilemma with the pia mater; or, admitting the distinction, whether the difference can be made out by ophthalmoscopic characters.Till this is decided, we can- not so much as pass the threshold of the inquiry as to the mode of pro- duction of optic changes in diseases of the brain.If I were not held back by the doubts of men such as Dr. Hughlings Jackson and Mr. Hutchinson, whose opinion in this matter I hold to be far higher than my own, I should consider my own experience warranted me in ollowing Dr. Clifford Allbutt in recognising a difference between optic isclhamia",

      "title": "Delirium in Elderly People: A Review",
      "abstract": "The present review aims to highlight this intricate syndrome, regarding diagnosis, pathophysiology, etiology, prevention and management in elderly people. The diagnosis of delirium is based on clinical observations, cognitive assessment, detailed family history, physical and neurological examination. Clinically, delirium occurs in hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed forms, based on psychomotor behaviour. As an acute confusional state, it is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms, fluctuating course and an altered level of consciousness, global disturbance of cognition or perceptual abnormalities and evidence of a physical cause. In spite of pathophysiological mechanisms of delirium remaining unclear, current evidence suggests that disruption of neurotransmission, inflammation or acute stress responses might all contribute to the development of this ailment. It usually occurs as a result of a complex interaction of multiple risk factors, such as cognitive impairment/dementia, current hip fracture and presence of severe illness. Despite all of the above, delirium is frequently under-recognized and often misdiagnosed by health professionals. In particular, this happens due to its fluctuating nature, its overlap with dementia and the scarcity of routine formal cognitive assessment in general hospitals. It is also associated with multiple adverse outcomes that have been well documented, such as increased hospital stay, function/cognitive decline, institutionalization and mortality. In this context, early identification of delirium will be essential. Timely and optimal management of people with delirium, should be performed with identification of possible underlying causes, dealing with a suitable care environment and improving education of health professionals. All these can be important factors, which contribute to a decrease in adverse outcomes associated with delirium.",

      "title": "Old age depression and its treatment.",
      "abstract": "The Numbers of elderly people are gradually increasing in our society, and mood disorders are progressively increasing among older people. Old age depression may also occur after life events: the death of the significant other, economical reasons, health problems (neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, nutritional deficiency) and can develop into a depressive state. Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life in older people. Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young/adults and in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality. The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities: - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do not complain about their low mood; - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including hallucinatory symptoms are often present; - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with neuro-sensory symptoms; - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask and overlap the depressive state; - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from \"pseudodementia\" and \"dementia\". In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial disease.",

      "abstract": "The human disease caused by niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency is pellagra, a disease that at one time filled insane asylums all over the world before the function of niacin was discovered. The recognition of pellagra as an endemic disease in the US dates from Searcy’s report in 1907 (Strandell et al., 1989) describing 88 cases of dementia in the Mount Vernon, Alabama Insane Asylum. Extensive knowledge about the course of pellagra has since been obtained and this disease has been eradicated as a public health problem; however, exact relationships between niacin deficiency and specific lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) remain poorly defined. Other nutritional deficiencies, common among patients in mental hospitals and in those with senility (Gregory, 1955; Hersov, 1955; McIlwain, 1966), undoubtedly contribute to neuronal dysfunction and exacerbate neurological problems associated with niacin deficiency. Mental symptoms associated with niacin deficiency often precede the dermatitis and other effects of this nutritional deficiency, suggesting a special sensitivity of the nervous system. If initial mental disturbances are not remedied by administration of nicotinic acid or tryptophan, from which nicotinic acid is synthesized in vivo, permanent structural changes occur in cerebral tissue.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when the pancreas does not produce\r\nenough insulin or the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produced by hyperglycemia\r\nand other related disorders in the body’s metabolism can lead to serious damage to many of\r\nthe body systems especially of nerves and blood vessels. Diabetic complications are\r\nclassified in to two major categories like acute and chronic. The acute complications of\r\ndiabetes include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome,\r\nhypoglycemia. The chronic complications of diabetes again classified in to micro vascular\r\nand macro vascular complications. The micro vascular complications include diabetic\r\nretinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy. Macro vascular complications are\r\nstroke, hypertension, insulin resistance syndrome. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is nerve\r\ndamage that occurs because of the metabolic degenerations associated with diabetes\r\nmellitus. The most common symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy include pain,\r\nburning, tingling, or numbness in the toes or feet, and extreme sensitivity to light touch. The\r\npain may be worst at rest and improve with activity, such as walking. Some people initially\r\nhave intensely painful feet while others have few or no symptoms. Diabetic peripheral\r\nneuropathy usually affects both sides of the body. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy treated\r\nwith main three components that is , tight control of blood sugar levels , care for the feet to\r\nprevent complications and Control of pain caused by neuropathy. Diabetic patients are\r\nencouraged to follow a daily leg exercises , foot care regimens like washing , and inspecting\r\nthe foot proper fitting shoes can prevent major complications.\r\nA study was done to evaluate the effectiveness of exercises on pain and sleep among\r\npatients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in selected hospitals, Erode.\r\nAn Evaluative approach was used for this study. The research design used was Quasi\r\nexperimental non equivalent pre test and post test control group design. The conceptual\r\nframework of the study was based on the “Modified Ludwig Von Bertlanffy System theory\r\n(1968). Non probability purposive sampling method was used to select 60 samples for the\r\nstudy. 30 samples were in experimental group was selected from S.R.C diabetes care centre\r\nErode and 30 samples were in control group was selected from Monika diabetes care centre\r\nErode. The tool used for this study was Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Signs and\r\nSymptoms Scale to assess the level of pain and Sleep Scale from medical outcome of study\r\nto assess the level of sleep, exercises was given to the patients with diabetic peripheral\r\nneuropathy for 30 minutes once in a day for a period of 15 days in experimental group.\r\nThe data gathered were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics. The\r\nmean post test level of pain in experimental group 9.6(SD±3.15) was significantly lower\r\nthan the mean posttest level of pain in control group 15.9(SD±2.99) The mean difference\r\nwas 6.3.The Independent‘t’ value was 8.51which was significant at p<0.05 level. The mean\r\npost test scores of sleep in experimental group 47.7 (SD±5.56) was significantly higher than\r\nthe mean post test scores of sleep in control group 34.2(SD±7.03). The mean difference was\r\n13.5.The independent‘t’ value was 8.88which was significant at p<0.05 level. The mean\r\npost test scores of pain and sleep among patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in\r\nexperimental group were 9.6(SD±3.15) and 47.7 (SD±5.56) respectively. The mean\r\ndifference was 38.1. The ‘r’ value was -0.9 which showed that negative relationship\r\nbetween pain and sleep scores among patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in\r\nexperimental group. It reveals that as the pain level decreases sleep pattern was improved.\r\nThe study findings revealed that there was a significant association between post test\r\nlevel of pain among patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy with demographic\r\nvariables of marital status(χ2=7.74), family monthly income(χ2=9.65), and duration of\r\ntreatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy(χ2=7.66) at p<0.05 level of significance and no\r\nsignificant association between post test level of sleep score in experimental group. There is\r\na decreased level of pain and improvement in the level of sleep pattern among patients with\r\ndiabetic peripheral neuropathy after exercises.

Clinical examination apart from sensory testing serves to rule out other facial pain conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging is essential as an aetiological investigation but requires use of specific imaging paradigms that allow visualization of the affected cranial nerve, surrounding blood vessels, and respective root entry zones to detect neurovascular compression. Only magnetic resonance imaging is capable of showing strategically placed brain lesions, such as multiple sclerosis plaques or solitary pontine lesions. Neurophysiological testing employing trigeminal reflexes reveals response abnormalities in practically all cases of secondary trigeminal neuralgia. As important as searching for a clinical diagnosis is assessment of the impact of the pain on the patient’s mood, functionality, and quality of life requires dedicated attention. Use of validated psychometric questionnaires will greatly facilitate this.",

      "title": "Stress and immunity: minireview.",
      "abstract": "Stress, a state of threatened homeostasis, may be induced by various physical or psychological factors (stressors), including antigenic stimulation. Stressful experiences may affect both physical/psychological well being and immune functioning of humans and animals; the ongoing immune reaction may affect other physiological functions and psychological comfort. The molecular basis of these effects involves a network of multidirectional signalling and feedback regulations of neuroendocrine- and immunocyte-derived mediators. The consecutive stages of the multistep immune reactions might be either inhibited or enhanced owing to the previous and/or parallel stress experiences, depending on the kind of stressor and the animal species, strain, gender, or age. Therefore, the final results of stress-induced alteration of immune reactions are difficult to predict. The effect of a particular stressor on immune functions varies according to the previous stress experience of the individual (e.g. social confrontation, sterile saline injection) while various stressors may act in the same or in opposite ways on the same immune parameter. In general, the efficacy of immune response depends on the neuroendocrine environment on which it is superimposed. Conversely, neural and endocrine responses depend on the concurrent immune events upon which they are superimposed. It seems that the consequences of stress on the immune functioning are generally adaptive in the short run but can be damaging when stress is chronic.",

      "title": "Esclerosis lateral amiotrófica, revisión epidemiológica, clínica y terapéutica de una catastrófica enfermedad neurológica en términos pronósticos",
      "abstract": "La esclerosis lateral amiotrófica (ELA) es un trastorno neurodegenerativo que afecta principalmente al sistema motor, pero en el que se reconocen cada vez más las manifestaciones extramotoras. La pérdida de neuronas motoras superiores e inferiores en la corteza motora, los núcleos del tronco encefálico y el asta anterior de la médula espinal da lugar a una debilidad muscular progresiva y atrofia. ALS a menudo tiene un inicio focal, pero posteriormente se propaga a diferentes regiones del cuerpo, donde la falla de los músculos respiratorios generalmente limita la supervivencia de 2 a 5 años después del inicio de la enfermedad. Hasta en el 50% de los casos existen manifestaciones extramotoras como cambios en el comportamiento, disfunción ejecutiva y problemas del lenguaje. En el 10%-15% de los pacientes, estos problemas son lo suficientemente graves como para cumplir los criterios clínicos de demencia frontotemporal (DFT). En el 10% de los pacientes con ELA, los antecedentes familiares sugieren un patrón de herencia autosómico dominante. El 90% restante no tiene familiares afectados y se clasifican como ELA esporádica. Las causas de la ELA parecen ser heterogéneas y solo se comprenden parcialmente. Hasta la fecha, se han asociado más de 20 genes con la ELA. La causa genética más común es una expansión repetida de hexanucleótidos en el Gen C9orf72 , responsable del 30-50% de la ELA familiar y del 7% de la ELA esporádica. Estas expansiones también son una causa frecuente de demencia frontotemporal, lo que enfatiza la superposición molecular entre ALS y DFT. Hasta el día de hoy, no existe una cura o un tratamiento eficaz para la ELA y la piedra angular del tratamiento sigue siendo la atención multidisciplinaria, que incluye el apoyo nutricional y respiratorio y el control de los síntomas. En esta revisión, se discuten diferentes aspectos de la ELA, incluida la epidemiología, la etiología, la patogenia, las características clínicas, el diagnóstico diferencial, las investigaciones, el tratamiento y las perspectivas futuras.",

Poor metacognition prevents correct appraisal of a range of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms and facilitates anosognosia, which has important clinical implications for individuals (e.g., diminished treatment adherence, increased engagement in high-risk situations) and caregivers (e.g., higher burden). However, the neural correlates of metacognitive disturbance are still debated in the literature, partly because of the subjective nature of traditional awareness measures.",

      "title": "Movement disorders: a brief practical approach to diagnosis and management",
      "abstract": "The characteristic feature of all movement disorders is an abnormality of the form and velocity of movements of the body. The term ‘movement disorder’ has become synonymous with basal ganglia disease and extrapyramidal features. Although many movement disorders do arise from pathology within the basal ganglia, disorders such as myoclonus may also arise from other structures. Abnormality of movement may be the only manifestation of a disease process, or may be part of a more widespread neurological disorder. It is important not to divorce the disorder of movement from general medical problems, since these may be directly or indirectly related (for example, chorea in systemic lupus erythematosus; DIP caused by amiodarone). Basal ganglia disease is commonly associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms and these may have a greater impact upon the patient and their family than the movement disorder itself. An essential first step in the approach to the patient with a movement disorder is to correctly determine the phenomenology of the problem (for example, is the dominant problem chorea or dystonia?). Once this first step has been made, appropriately targeted investigations may then be required to determine the diagnosis. Thereafter, consideration is given to treatment, based upon clinical and social factors, as well as patient preference. This overview will describe a practical approach to the patient with a movement disorder. It will also briefly consider some broad principles in the investigation and management of such cases.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Multiple Disorders of Sleep and Wakefulness with excessive movement, sleepiness or insomnia are common, affecting most children at some period of life. Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

      "abstract": "Psychische Schaeden als Unfallfolgen fuehren oft zum Rechtsstreit. Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis. Unerlaesslich ist eine Pruefung der zeitlichen Abfolge (Folge nach der Ursache), also ob aehnliche Befunde bereits vor dem Unfall bestanden haben.

      "abstract": "Functional loss of vision or visual fields can present some of the most difficult diagnostic challenges, but even more difficult to diagnose are patients who have, in addition to functional visual loss, an organic disease. No matter how functional the symptoms appear, the clinician has to go that extra step to find any true pathology. This is why different field techniques may be more appropriate than the more sophisticated techniques. A tangent screen, for instance, may be better to control the patient’s response than a Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer. Remember the functional patients get sick, too. Patients with functional field loss can be placed into one of three general groups: neurasthenics, hysterics, or malingerers. The neurasthenic patient usually has many complaints, not limited to the visual system or to one set of visual symptoms such as field loss. The complaints, as well as the degree of field or visual defect, frequently vary from one examination to another, as well as during an examination as fatigue increases. The spiral field is often found in neurasthenic patients. The patient with hysteria, on the other hand, usually has a single ocular complaint. This chapter discusses the hysterical loss of acuity or fields. The usual field defect is a severe tubular type of contraction. The spiral field is sometimes seen in these patients. The malingerer may be the most difficult patient with functional loss, particularly if he has previously been examined by another physician and has acquired more experience with field testing than he had when first examined. The spiral field is not limited to functional loss; it can also be seen as a fatigue phenomenon in sick patients when the field testing is unduly prolonged. Its essential feature is that the field becomes progressively smaller as a specific isopter is tested for a second and third time with the same size of test object. shows all the points that were tested with a 3-mm white test object.",

Neurological patients should be evaluated for risk factors for perinatal depression before delivery. These include previous psychiatric disease, sexual or psychical abuse, sleep problems, high neurological disease activity, and low social support. Pregnant women with previous psychotic episodes or bipolar disease should be referred for psychiatric evaluation before delivery.

      "title": "Diagnostic Yield of REM Sleep Muscle Activity for Presumed Synucleinopathy Neurodegeneration (N7.001)",
      "abstract": "Objective: To determine whether polysomnographic REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) distinguishes between clinically diagnosed synucleinopathy (SYN) and non-synucleinopathy (NSYN) etiologies of cognitive impairment and/or parkinsonism. Background: Neurodegenerative disease arises more commonly secondary to two proteinopathies; alpha-synuclein [(Parkinson disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)] and tau [(Alzheimer’s dementia (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal syndrome (CBS)], although other proteinopathies frequently co-exist. Symptom overlap complicates accurate antemortem diagnosis and additional diagnostic tools to distinguish between clinically diagnosed SYN and NSYN etiologies are needed. Design/Methods: We analyzed quantitative RSWA in 138 patients; 73 SYN (33 PD, 20 MSA, 20 DLB), 50 NSYN (15 AD, 11 FTD, 17 PSP, 7 CBS), and 15 primary snoring controls. Phasic, tonic, and “any” muscle activity percentages and phasic burst durations were calculated in the submentalis (SM) and anterior tibialis (AT) muscles. The automated REM atonia index was also determined in SM. Statistical group comparisons and regression were performed, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves used to determine RSWA cutoffs that distinguished SYN from NSYN. Results: All RSWA measures were significantly greater in SYN patients. SM cutoffs with AUC >0.9 (sensitivity, specificity) were: “any” 11.5% (75%, 96%); phasic 10.8% (75%, 98%); phasic burst duration 0.61 seconds (74%, 94%). In contrast, AT SYN discrimination was poor. Cutoffs were similar irrespective of clinical dream enactment behavior. Subgroup analysis showed greatest SM RSWA in patients with MSA, similar RSWA elevations in PD and DLB patients, and control level RSWA in AD, FTD, PSP and CBS patients. Conclusions: Quantitative submentalis REM sleep muscle activity accurately distinguished clinically diagnosed SYN from NSYN etiologies, even without clinical dream enactment. Polysomnographic RSWA appears to be a useful diagnostic tool for probable alpha-synucleinopathy in patients with parkinsonism and/or cognitive impairment.

In studies evaluating the possible role of depression in these associations, depression among sexually assaulted persons did not account for their poorer health. Although there are unanswered questions in the literature on the associations between sexual assault and health, existing findings are consistent with standard criteria for inferring causal relationships from observational data. For example, many assault-health associations are supported by multiple, independent studies, and many demonstrate dose-response relationships (i.e., more incidents of sexual assault, or more severe assaults, are associated with more adverse health outcomes).",

EOD has a severe impact on the everyday life of both the patient involved and his caregivers. This situation is challenging for the clinician, taking into consideration the fact that differential diagnosis is broader as compared to late onset dementia. Infrequent degenerative causes or rare diseases including inherited metabolic disorders need to be excluded. Moreover, even common degenerative dementias like Alzheimer disease have an unusual clinical pattern in younger patients and are therefore more difficult to diagnose. A thorough evaluation of symptoms, family history and neuropsychological deficits along with a targeted laboratory testing would unveil the underlying disorder in most cases. This is of great clinical significance since a great proportion of EOD causes are putatively treatable when diagnosed during an early stage of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Psychosocial factors play an undoubtedly important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases and can also highly affect efficacy and outcome of cardiac treatment or the success of rehabilitation.These factors are proven to have a major role in patient evaluation in two ways: (1) risk factors are important in establishing prognosis and/or as (2) indicators of need for further specific psychological interventions.According to the literature available: depression, severe anxiety and other psychosocial characteristics are considered to be risk factors.These factors include low socio-economic status, chronic family or work related stress, social isolation or lack of support, negative emotions, affective dysregulation and also negative personality patterns or hostility.Identifying and examining these factors have great importance in multidisciplinary patient care.It is important to highlight the chances of adverse outcome and provide clinical solutions since many of the risk factors are treatable psychological conditions.",

      "title": "What is comorbidity and why does it occur?",
      "abstract": "Introduction:Comorbidity can be defined most generally as the co-occurrence of two or moremental health problems. It has emerged as a major clinical, public health andresearch issue over the past few decades. This is due in part to changes in psychiatricnomenclature, in which there is a greater focus upon elucidating any number ofmental health problems with which an individual might present, rather thandiagnosing one problem to the exclusion of others.Currently, mental health problems are conceptualised as patterns of behaviour orthought that are associated with significant disability, distress, loss of individualfreedom, or adverse events such as death; and which arise from dysfunction withinthe individual (Neugebauer, 1999). These problems can encompass a wide range ofbehaviours including substance use, mood disturbances, anxiety, and disturbances inthought and perception.According to current classification systems in psychology and psychiatry, mentaldisorders are diagnosed according to operationalised diagnostic criteria, and thediagnosis of one disorder does not necessarily preclude the diagnosis of another(American Psychiatric Association, 1994;World Health Organisation, 1993). Insome cases, more than one mental disorder is diagnosed — such comorbidity isexamined in this chapter. Specifically, this chapter will define the concept ofcomorbidity; discuss the implications of comorbidity for theories of mental health,treatment and prevention; give a brief overview of epidemiological research intocomorbidity; and examine the reasons why comorbidity might occur.",

Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status. Failure to distinguish act from status accounts for the wide disparities in definitions of malingering.",

Alcohol may have significance as a risk factor for the perpetrator (culprit, car driver, etc.), as well as for the victim. This is especially clear in cases of violence and assault. Younger males are overrepresented in much of the data that shows causal relationships. A clear dose‐response association can be seen in many accident cases concerning both accident risk and severity. The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate. Factors such as the abuse of other drugs, unemployment, and other sociodemo‐graphic factors must be taken into account. The populations studied are often selected, e.g., from emergency departments, pathology units (postmortem data), or related to those epidemiological studies based on interviews.

      "abstract": "The majority of children with autism show deviance and socially or psychiatrically handicapping conditions throughout life. Only a small proportion of those with classical childhood autism lead independent adult lives. Others, particularly those with ‘high‐functioning’ autism and so‐called Asperger syndrome will improve enough to live an independent adult life. The level of mental retardation and other comorbid conditions (such as medical syndromes and other neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy) is important in predicting outcome. An IQ below 50 around school age predicts severe restriction of social and adaptive functioning in adult life. The absence of communicative speech at 5–6 years of age is indicative of a poorer long‐term overall outcome. There is a clear co‐variation between IQ and level of communication, but probably there is some prognostic factor in language development apart from this. Measures of flexibility and cognitive shifting abilities tend to be good predictors of social outcome in a few studies. There is a continued need for prospective, longitudinal studies of children with autism spectrum disorders, particularly in Asperger syndrome. The role of interventions of various kinds needs to be addressed in such studies.",

      "title": "Insight in bipolar disorder",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Insight in bipolar disorder While the relationship between lack of insight in psychiatric disorders and anosognosia in neurological disorders has not been extensively studied, interest in examining psychiatric lack of insight has roots in advances in the understanding of the anosognosia. It is possible that both conditions share a common etiology in parietal and/or frontal lobe dysfunction, or they may represent two distinct entities with different etiologies, i.e., with predominance of brain dysfunction in anosognosia as opposed to the possible prominence of psychosocial factors in psychiatric lack of insight. While it has long been recognized that insight is impaired in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, the topic of insight in bipolar disorder has been relatively neglected. In mania, impairment of insight is about as severe as in schizophrenia and probably is associated with poor prognosis. The neuropsychological and/or psychosocial roots of lack of insight in mania remain unclear even if we recently reported that lack of insight might predict impaired decision-making in manic patients. In bipolar depression, impairment of insight is less severe than in mania; however, psychotic depression is associated with less insight than non-psychotic depression. There is some evidence that insight in depression may be less impaired when depressive symptoms are more severe, possibly supporting the depressive realism hypothesis. In remission, bipolar patients seem to recover insight. Thus, lack of insight in bipolar disorder appears to be a state-related phenomenon, unlike schizophrenia. Interest in studying clinical, neuropsychological and biological roots of insight in bipolar disorder, and their changes across different phases of illness, may improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying awareness of well-being in human.

Electrophysiological studies, laboratory screening for circulating autoantibodies, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and muscle or sensory nerve biopsies in selected cases aid the clinician in making the neurological diagnosis. Discrete components of the nervous system such as the neuromuscular junction's calcium channels (Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) or acetylcholine receptors (myasthenia gravis) are the targets of immunoaggression. Treatment directed at the tumor and the demonstrable or presumed immunological pathophysiology, assisted by supportive medical care and symptomatic drug therapies, offers the best chance for clinical improvement.",

      "abstract": "The neuromatrix theory of pain proposes that pain is a multidimensional experience produced by characteristic “neurosignature” patterns of nerve impulses generated by a widely distributed neural network – the “body‐self neuromatrix”– in the brain. These neurosignature patterns may be triggered by sensory inputs, but they may also be generated independently of them. Pains that are evoked by noxious sensory inputs have been meticulously investigated by neuroscientists, and their sensory transmission mechanisms are generally well understood. In contrast, chronic pain syndromes, which are often characterized by severe pain associated with little or no discernible injury or pathology, remain a mystery. The neuromatrix theory of pain, however, provides a new conceptual framework that is consistent with recent clinical evidence. It proposes that the output patterns of the neuromatrix activate perceptual, homeostatic and behavioral programs after injury or pathology, or as a result of multiple other inputs that act on the neuromatrix. Pain, then, is produced by the output of a widely distributed neural network in the brain rather than directly by sensory input evoked by injury, inflammation or other pathology. The neuromatrix, which is genetically determined and modified by sensory experience, is the primary mechanism that generates the neural pattern that produces pain. Its output pattern is determined by multiple influences, of which the somatic sensory input is only a part, that converge on the neuromatrix.",

Third, sleepiness in children is often obscured by irritability. paradoxical hyperactivity, or behavioral disturbances. Anseguently, careful clinical evaluation is needed for the sleepy children. Usual causes of sleepiness in children are the disorders that induce insufficient sleep such as sleep apnea syndrome, schedule disorder, underlying medical and psychiatric disorder, and so forth. After excluding such factors, we can diagnose the hypersomnic disorders such as narcolepsy, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and idiopathic central nervous system hypersomnia. Among the variety of those causes of sleepiness, I reviewed the clinical difference of narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in childhood compared with in adulthood. Recognition of the childhood narcolepsy is difficult because even severely sleepy children often do not develop pathognomic cataplexy and associated REM phenomena until much later. Since childhood narcolepsy give srise to many psychological, academical problem. Practicers should be concerned about these aspects. Childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is different from adult obstructive sleep apnea syndrome too. Several aspects such as pathophysiology. clinical feature, diagnostic criteria, complication, management, and prognosis differ from those in the adult syndrome. An important feature of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is the variety of severe complications such as behavioral disorders, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular symptoms, developmental delay, and ever death. Fortunately, surgical interventions like adenotosillectomy or UPPP are more effective for Childhood OSA than adult form. CPAP is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated treatment modality too. So if early detection and proper management of childhood OSA were done, the severe complication would be prevented or ever cured.",

The status of senile dementia of the Binswanger's type as a distinct entity is a matter of some controversy. The array of neuroimaging abnormalities and clinical findings attributed to this condition overlap with a number of other neuropathologies. Leukoaraiosis, or attenuation of subcortical white matter, seen on computed tomographic scans or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, is a hallmark of senile dementia of the Binswanger's type. The clinical findings associated with Binswanger's disease are varied but typically include a progressive dementia, depression and \"subcortical\" dysfunction such as gait abnormalities, rigidity and neurogenic bladder. Treatment is largely supportive and includes a discussion about advanced directives, social support and antidepressant therapy. Control of hypertension and aspirin prophylaxis may help prevent further progression of white matter disease.",

      "title": "Long-term Cognitive and Functional Impairments After Critical Illness",
      "abstract": "As critical illness survivorship increases, patients and health care providers are faced with management of long-term sequelae including cognitive and functional impairment. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated impairments persisting at least 1–5 years after hospitalization for critical illness. Cognitive domains impacted include memory, attention, and processing speed. Functional impairments include physical weakness, reduced endurance, and dependence on others for basic tasks of daily living such as bathing or feeding. In characterizing the trajectory of long-term recovery, multiple risk factors have been identified for subsequent impairment, including increased severity of illness and severe sepsis, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and delirium. Preadmission status including frailty, high level of preexisting comorbidities, and baseline cognitive dysfunction are also associated with impairment after critical illness. Development of cognitive and functional impairment is likely multifactorial, and multiple mechanistic theories have been proposed. Neuroinflammation, disruption of the blood–brain barrier, and structural alterations in the brain have all been observed in patients with long-term cognitive dysfunction. Systemic inflammation has also been associated with alterations in muscle integrity and function, which is associated with intensive care unit–acquired weakness and prolonged functional impairment. Efforts to ease the burden of long-term impairments include prevention strategies and rehabilitation interventions after discharge. Delirium is a well-established risk factor for long-term cognitive dysfunction, and using delirium-prevention strategies may be important for cognitive protection. Current evidence favors minimizing overall sedation exposure, careful selection of sedation agents including avoidance of benzodiazepines, and targeted sedation goals to avoid oversedation. Daily awakening and spontaneous breathing trials and early mobilization have shown benefit in both cognitive and functional outcomes. Multifactorial prevention bundles are useful tools in improving care provided to patients in the intensive care unit. Data regarding cognitive rehabilitation are limited, while studies on functional rehabilitation have conflicting results. Continued investigation and implementation of prevention strategies and rehabilitation interventions will hopefully improve the quality of life for the ever-increasing population of critical illness survivors.",

      "title": "Syncope And Related Paroxysmal Spells",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal spells are non-epileptic, paroxysmal events that may mimic epileptic seizures but are not associated with rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons typical of seizures. They clinically manifest as a transient loss of consciousness, often occurring suddenly, with or without a prodrome. Paroxysmal spells can be caused by psychological disorders such as substance abuse and psychiatric disease or physiological events such as hypoglycemia, traumatic brain injury, and syncope. Psychological Conditions Data suggest that men with psychiatric disease have an increased incidence of syncope or paroxysmal events of unknown etiology. This data should lead clinicians to consider screening for psychiatric disorders in patients with transient loss of consciousness they cannot identify with a clear etiology.Among patients with a history of substance use disorder, 45% have been found to have unexplained syncope. This suggests that prior and current substance use is also associated with increased incidence of transient loss of consciousness of unknown etiology. Patients evaluated in the emergency department or even hospitalized with syncope of unknown etiology may benefit from toxicology screening and possible detoxification referral. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is defined as low blood sugar with associated symptoms. In patients without diabetes mellitus, this is usually manifested at glucose levels below 50 mg/dl. To diagnose hypoglycemia, symptoms and blood sugar must improve with exogenous glucose. Hypoglycemia can affect the central nervous system, leading to lightheadedness, nausea, flashes of light, focal neurological deficits, transient loss of consciousness, and seizure. It is, therefore, paramount that patients with any paroxysmal spell or syncope receive a fingerstick glucose. Traumatic Brain Injury Traumatic brain injury is an intracranial impairment, often due to external forces. These forces may include blunt or penetrating trauma to the head, causing acceleration/deceleration injury to the cerebral cortex. Intracerebral bleeding, lacerations, and diffuse axonal injuries may result. Injuries, such as an epidural hematoma, may cause a brief state of loss of consciousness, with rapid return of, usually, altered consciousness. Other injuries, such as large subdural hematoma or diffuse axonal injury may cause worsening mentation and coma over hours to days. This is a result of increased intracranial pressure, leading to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, and finally, neuronal ischemia. Diagnosis is by clinical history and CT imaging, although MRI may be more specific for secondary trauma. Management is to reduce intracranial pressure and edema. Syncope As most paroxysmal events are syncopal, the remainder of this discussion will focus primarily on syncope. Physiologically, syncope is a transient loss of consciousness as a result of cerebral hypoperfusion. As such, syncope varies from other etiologies of loss of consciousness in that it does not include head trauma or a post-ictal state. Syncope instead results in complete and rapid resolution of mental status. It may have myoclonic jerking, but no generalized tonic-clonic movement. Rather than a disease, syncope is a symptom of an underlying pathology ranging from benign to life-threatening. Patients are often divided into low-risk and high-risk groups. The etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, treatment, and management of these patients vary greatly. In the United States, hospitalization costs for syncope are estimated to be $5300 per admission and more than $2 billion annually. These costs are higher than those of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma combined. As extensive workups can be costly, time-consuming, and often unnecessary, a growing cadre of management tools has been devised to evaluate patients with syncope. These tools are tailored to determining the etiology of the syncopal event and treating dangerous, high-risk, syncope patients.",

Definitions have changed and full filed parallel to the development of medicine and new discoveries. Cerebral palsy is defined as a group of permanent movement and pasture disorders that cause limitation in activities and are the consequence of unprogresive disorders of immature brain or brain that is developing. The children with cerebral palsy can also have some others damages such as vision, learning, sense or speech damages, intellectual damage, epilepsy, feeding disorders and so on. Cerebral palsy can be divided into four types: spastic, choreoatetotic, ataxic and mixed type. All limbs can be affected, that is, both arms and legs (quadriplegic), or mostly just the legs (diplexia), or just a hand and a leg on one side of the body (hemiplegia). It can not be surely determinate which are the causes of cerebral palsy. The causes are not the complications during child birth, but different prenatal factors and indications, which are divided as prenatal, perinatal and postnatal. Also, there are mostly several causes, and not only one that leeds to the formation of cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy symptoms can be detected already in early childhood. When detected, the doctors pediatricians and physiatrists will set the diagnosis and determine the necessary exercises. Very important factors for successful integration and active participation of people with cerebral palsy are family support and timely treatments. If needed, a child with cerebral palsy can have an assistant or a therapeutic dog. With a purpose to view more insight into the life and everyday activities of people with cerebral palsy, it has been done a research which has shown that most people with cerebral palsy dresses by themselves, do the hygiene by themselves, participate in housekeeping, but unfortunately most respondents are unemployed, have difficulties in living, and don't do the sports. The conclusions of the research pointed to the need for greats involvement of society in the implementation of activities aimed at improving the life of people with cerebral palsy.",

      "title": "Social trauma : consequences of emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection in subjects with social anxiety disorder",
      "abstract": "A history of child maltreatment is associated with psychopathology, predominantly affective and anxiety disorders as well as substance abuse. In the past, research has primarily focused on the consequences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect or combinations of these types of maltreatment. However, besides physical and sexual transgressions, child maltreatment does also involve emotional abuse and emotional neglect. Although it was suggested that the consequences of emotional maltreatment might be as severe as the outcomes of physical or sexual maltreatment, there is little knowledge about the unique effects of emotional maltreatment on psychopathology. However, there is a growing body of evidence for an association of emotional maltreatment by caretakers and psychopathology, particularly social anxiety.\r\nIn addition to emotional maltreatment that involves abuse and neglect by parents and other caretakers, emotional abusive treatments (also referred to as emotional victimization) are highly prevalent among peers. Similar to emotional maltreatment by parents or caretakers, emotional peer victimization contributes to various forms of general psychopathology, e.g., depression, anger-hostility, dissociation, and drug use. However, peer victimization is particularly associated with characteristics of social anxiety disorder.\r\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder, which is characterized by persistent fear of social or performance situations, fear of negative evaluation, social avoidance of general and new situations, as well as physiological symptoms in social situations. However, the mechanisms that associate emotional maltreatment by caretakers as well as peers and social anxiety are still unknown. Models of cognitive vulnerability suggest that negative learning experiences establish associative information structures in memory that activate various stereotype and pathological behavioral programs in similar situations. This conceptualization predicts that social events may provoke more intense reactions in emotional maltreated subjects as such situations trigger associative response elements of social traumatic experiences. \r\nA key element of emotional maltreatment is social rejection. Experiences of social rejection elicit negative mood, emotional distress, and activity of neural networks that are associated with the processing of physical pain. However, because physiological reactions to social rejection were found to be ambiguous, there remains a need for clarification of the impact and direction of social rejection on other physiological measures such as heart rate and skin conductance. In socially anxious subjects, social rejection elicited immediate and delayed effects on psychological outcomes. Therefore both, physiological reactions in healthy subjects as well as increased psychological reactions in socially anxious subjects were suggested in previous studies. However, a combination of these, i.e., an investigation of physiological reactions in socially anxious subjects, was not presented, yet. This might be of specific interest, as fear of social rejection is one of the core components of social anxiety. Accordingly, socially anxious subjects should present stronger and prolonged physiological reactions to social rejection.\r\nHowever, there is so far minimal evidence that experiences of aversive social situations evoke an associative network and an activation of associative memory processing. The aim of the present work was to address this point and to explore the impact of prior emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection. In addition, it was assumed that associative memory representations are potential links between maltreatment and social anxiety disorder. Thus, the effect of a history of emotional maltreatment on the experience of potential traumatic social events was expected to be even stronger for subjects with SAD.\r\nIn a first step, the association of emotional maltreatment with social anxiety was examined. Results indicate a relation of childhood maltreatment with psychopathology, and in particular, social anxiety symptoms. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the relative impact of emotional forms of abuse and neglect might even be higher than indicated by previous research on child maltreatment, which had mainly focused on physical and sexual types of abuse and neglect. Moreover, emotional maltreatment mediated the association of physical maltreatment and social anxiety. In addition to emotional maltreatment through parents and other caretakers, reports of emotional peer victimizations were independently related to social anxiety symptoms. Thus, it was concluded that symptoms of social anxiety are mainly predicted by emotional types of victimization, either in childhood through the caretakers, or during childhood and adolescence through peers.\r\nAs a second step, physiological reactions to social rejection were examined in healthy subjects. The results suggest that social rejection evokes reactions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) apparent in accelerated heart rates. Although the effects of social rejection did not imply changes of skin conductance levels, it was concluded that the autonomic nervous system is affected by experiences of social exclusion indicating that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. \r\nAfter that the link between social rejection and physiological reactions had been established, it was examined whether these reactions are affected by histories of emotional maltreatment and symptoms of social anxiety. Data suggested that reactions to an episode of social exclusion were primarily influenced by the degree of relational peer victimization rather than by the diagnosis of SAD. While an increase in skin conductance immediately after the exclusion was observed for all groups of subjects, this physiological response was attenuated among the subjects with a history of peer victimization.\r\nIn general, the results provided evidence for the existence and significance of associative networks and associative memory processing that is established by experiences of emotional maltreatment. In line with memory models of traumatic events and network models of emotional processing, a history of emotional maltreatment altered physiological reactions to a social challenge. After it has been demonstrated that experiences of emotional maltreatment place individuals at risk for symptoms of social anxiety disorder, findings indicate that associative information processing may account for an enhanced cognitive vulnerability for social anxiety. Although the mechanisms involved remain uncertain, it may be speculated that altered physiological reactivity in subjects with a history of emotional maltreatment contributes to the development of social anxiety. \r\nImportantly, the findings of the present research highlight the role of emotional forms of abuse and neglect in the development of a wide range of psychological disorders. Besides the impact of emotional maltreatment on social anxiety, the present research suggested influences of emotional maltreatment on various types of psychopathology. These findings establish a cross-diagnostical perspective on the consequences of emotional maltreatment. Assuming that experiences of emotional abuse and neglect account for various forms of symptomatology, it may be speculated that a plurality of patients would benefit from treatments that address these experiences. Therefore, the development of therapeutic interventions that combine disorder-specific treatments with an approach that focuses on adverse life experiences including social trauma should be a main goal of future clinical research.",

The greatest interest, however, has been generated by the association between TBI and schizophrenia-like psychosis (Krafft-Ebing 1868), and this is the focus of this chapter. The most important question is whether TBI predisposes an individual to schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis. If this association can be unequivocally established, a number of other issues become relevant, such as the prevalence of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI, its clinical features, risk factors, and prognosis. An important corollary is whether the study of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI can advance the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Classifying cerebral palsy subtypes",
      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy is a heterogeneous syndrome that is the most common form of physical impairment encountered in pediatrics. Its heterogeneity, which is apparent in all aspects of the disorder, challenges our attempts to classify it. Several classification structures do exist that seek to further our understanding of the basic mechanisms and needs associated with this entity. The most long-standing classification approach utilizes the neurologic examination to characterize and stratify the predominant qualitative pattern of motor impairment (i.e., spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic–hypotonic or mixed), and if spastic, the particular limb distribution. The severity of cerebral palsy can be summarized in the domains of gross motor and fine motor skills by the Gross Motor Function Classification System and the Manual Ability Classification System, respectively. Frequently for patients with cerebral palsy, the major health burden may not be that of a neuromotor impairment, but rather that of the associated conditions (i.e., epilepsy, intellectual disability, etc.) affecting the individual. Finally, one may employ a mechanistic approach to stratifying according to imaging results and etiology, which are linked and provide an insight into the pathogenesis and the timing of malformation or acquired injury. While the approaches used in each of these classification schemes are separate, distinct and single axial, inter-relationships are readily apparent. Each of the classification approaches capture only one aspect of a complex disorder and is thus too simplistic. A multimodal classification approach can be employed in a complimentary fashion to provide a more holistic profile of the individual with cerebral palsy.",

      "abstract": "From a biological point of view, mental disorders can be characterized as disturbances of complex oscillatory processes manifesting themselves on different organizational levels of the brain. One clinical example is the cyclic nature of bipolar disorders, sometimes with ultrarapid fluctuations. Regarding neurophysiology and brain electric activity, another example are certain EEG patterns indicating different modes of synchronization of neural activity. In this respect, reduced gamma activity has been found in prefrontal areas in schizophrenia. Since sleep disorders appear to be inherent in virtually all mental disorders, they are of particular interest and in the focus of studies of oscillatory processes. Onset, depth, duration, frequency, and duration of different sleep phases etc. are significantly altered in depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, delirium tremens, and a wide spectrum of other disorders. Cortisol profiles and other biological parameters contribute to irregular temporal patterns in case of mental illnesses. Several replicated findings indicate that circadian and infradian rhythms of neurotransmitters as well as the endocrine system play a crucial role in this respect. A dynamic imbalance between norepinephrinergic, cholinergic and serotonergic transmission perturbs neuronal signaling, but it is unclear which of the components predominates. Reduced reactivity of feedback loops, slow on- or offset of activity of different neurotransmitter components are candidate to evoke dysfunctions in more global, higher circuits and connections, which may cause the complex symptomatology of depressive and manic states.",

As noted in Chapter 1, dysfunction of the human mind results in symptoms in three primary spheres: thinking (cognition), emotion (meaning), and motivation (ability to set and achieve goals). These disorders can also produce a variety of physical (or “neurovegetative”) symptoms that include changes in appetite, sleep, sexual function, and energy level, among others. Some people develop symptoms suggestive of other medical or neurological disorders, such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, pain, and memory disturbances. Additionally, patients with serious medical and neurological disorders can develop psychiatric disorders (e.g., people with diabetes are prone to develop depression), with adverse effects likely affecting the outcome of both conditions.",

Mental health legislation in England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland may apply to people with intellectual disability as well as to people with mental illness or personality disorder, and this is generally true in most countries around the world.

Pervasive developmental disorders, especially autism, are common among adults with intellectual disability.

The first of these is that the term hypothyroidism refers to the pathologic condition of the thyroid gland, whereas in fact, it refers to the condition in the body created by an insufficiency of the thyroid hormone in the tissues; this may occur without pathology in the thyroid itself. Second, the physician has in mind a clinical syndrome corresponding to myxedema, which is a rather rare and extreme form of thyroid deficiency. Far more common—and requiring diagnosis—is a clinical state of hypothyroidism, without the history or physical findings associated with myxedema. Third, the average physician, unfortunately, still feels that determination of the basal metabolic rate is a diagnostic test for hypothyroidism. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is indicated in a very wide variety of clinical conditions, such as (a) states of fatigue, somnolence, psychasthenia, malnutrition, obesity, anemia, hypertension, edema, chronic cardiac disease, diabetes, allergy, and gastroenterologic disorders, and (b) states of pituitary insufficiency appearing as disorders of the adrenal or gonad, since pituitary secretion is so dependent upon an adequate supply of the thyroid hormone. As indicated, hypothyroidism seems to be associated with almost every degenerative or functional disorder of every system of the body.",

Dissociative amnesia intersects with the study of normal and traumatic memory, childhood sexual abuse, and suggestibility. Dissociative amnesia is rarely the single symptom; in the majority of cases the amnesia symptom is embedded in, and co-occurs with, other dissociative phenomena. Hypnosis may well be used to access the memory that otherwise is unavailable to consciousness. Psychotherapy can include art therapy, dance and movement therapy, and journaling and creative writing therapies. In diagnosing dissociative amnesia it is most important to differentiate dissociative from non-dissociative amnesia. Assessment should focus on excluding organic causes, substance abuse, head trauma, or epilepsy. Most important information assessing dissociative amnesia is derived from the patient's history for there is a strong relation to psychological trauma.",

      "title": "The Whole Spectrum of Alcohol-Related Changes in the CNS: Practical MR and CT Imaging Guidelines for Daily Clinical Use",
      "abstract": "Alcohol addiction is the most common drug addiction. Alcohol passes both the placenta as well as the blood-brain barrier and is in multiple ways neurotoxic. Liver diseases and other systemic alcohol-related diseases cause secondary damage to the CNS. Especially in adolescents, even a single episode of severe alcohol intoxication (\"binge drinking\") may result in life-threatening neurological consequences. Alcohol-related brain and spinal cord diseases derive from multiple causes including impairment of the cellular metabolism, often aggravated by hypovitaminosis, altered neurotransmission, myelination and synaptogenesis as well as alterations in gene expression. Modern radiological diagnostics, MRI in particular, can detect the resulting alterations in the CNS with a high sensitivity. Morphological aspects often strongly correlate with clinical symptoms of the patient. It is less commonly known that many diseases considered as \"typically alcohol-related\", such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, are to a large extent not alcohol-induced. Visible CNS alterations are thus non-pathognomonic and demand careful evaluation of differential diagnoses. This review article elucidates the pathogenesis, clinical aspects and radiological image features of the most common alcohol-related CNS diseases and their differential diagnoses. <b>Key Points:</b> • Alcohol-associated changes in the CNS are common and radiologically assessable. • They are often subtle and allow multiple differential diagnoses besides alcohol consumption. • Knowledge of clinical exams and lab results is crucial for diagnostic accuracy. <b>Citation Format:</b> • Keil VC, Greschus S, Schneider C et al.

These are not due to sensory deficits or teaching failures, but rather are the result of specific neurobiological abnormalities. In the case of dyslexia, for instance, neuroimaging research has found atypical activation in critical regions of the left hemisphere, such as the fusiform gyrus or the temporoparietal region, involved in decoding and phonological abilities, and reduced functional connectivity among these and other (in)directly relevant language production areas. On another hand, dyscalculia, involves changes in the intraparietal sulcus and the thalamus with effects on the processing of numbers and working memory. The neuropsychological evaluation is the touchstone of diagnosis for these learning disorders and for the planning of more individualized remediation. A variety of neuroscience-informed treatments (e.g., hemispheric stimulation, cognitive training, transcranial electrical stimulation, and educational computer games) have been successful in increasing reading and executive functions. Further research is, however, still required to gain an improved understanding of these conditions and an ethical obligation among professionals to follow the developments in this emerging field of learning disorder neuroscience.",

      "abstract": "Résumé Parmi les facteurs de résistance thérapeutique d’un épisode dépressif majeur (EDM), on peut évoquer d’emblée l’association aux pathologies somatiques, au premier rang desquelles figurent les affections endocriniennes, cardiovasculaires et métaboliques. Plusieurs d’entre elles sont d’ailleurs susceptibles d’engendrer la survenue d’un EDM, en pérenniser les manifestations cliniques, et conduire à la résistance aux traitements classiquement proposés dans cette indication. La co-occurrence d’une pathologie somatique et d’un EDM n’est pas une situation rare en pratique clinique quotidienne dans la mesure où elle concerne 25 % de la population hospitalisée pour pathologie somatique [1]. Des études longitudinales montrent que les EDM contemporains d’une pathologie somatique sont plus à risque d’évoluer vers la chronicité ou la résistance aux stratégies thérapeutiques standards que les EDM sans comorbidité somatique [2]. Réciproquement, la dépression majeure est aujourd’hui reconnue pour accroître singulièrement le risque de développer un cancer, un trouble métabolique ou une pathologie cardiaque comme les cardiopathies ischémiques, avec un retentissement important sur l’évolution et le pronostic de la maladie somatique [3]. Cette comorbidité, à l’origine d’une résistance croisée entre les deux pathologies, est fréquemment méconnue en pratique clinique, souvent du fait d’une attention sélectivement portée sur la pathologie ayant motivé la prise en charge, mais aussi en raison des difficultés diagnostiques liées à la superposition des troubles. Sur le plan thérapeutique, les implications sont considérables. En effet, un traitement antidépresseur bien conduit montre souvent une efficacité, non seulement en réduisant l’intensité des symptômes dépressifs, mais également en améliorant le cours évolutif de la pathologie somatique, ainsi que son pronostic [4]. Une meilleure connaissance de ces intrications s’avère donc indispensable de façon à permettre le traitement de la pathologie associée, mais aussi limiter l’impact négatif de cette dernière sur le diagnostic et l’évolution de l’affection primitivement reconnue.",

      "title": "Models of Pediatric Epilepsies: Strategies and Opportunities",
      "abstract": "Pediatric epilepsies are among the most devastating of neurologic disorders. The developing brain is particularly susceptible to seizures, and seizure activity early in brain development can cause profound neurologic impairment, enhance subsequent seizure propensity during maturation and in adulthood, and lead to abnormalities in cognitive function (1). In infancy and childhood, two broad categories of epilepsy are of particular concern because of their intractability to treatment and association with cognitive decline: (a) The so-called “catastrophic” childhood epilepsies (including infantile spasms, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, and the progressive myoclonic epilepsies) are characterized by numerous etiologies, by age-specific developmental windows of seizure onset, by refractoriness to medical treatment, and by progressive cognitive deterioration (epileptic encephalopathy). Seizures associated with catastrophic epilepsy syndromes tend to have bilateral/generalized manifestations: (b) Refractory partial epilepsies are often associated with dysplastic brain lesions (i.e., tuberous sclerosis complex, TSC), or severe perinatally induced injuries (i.e., perinatal stroke or hypoxia); seizures of this type may be also seen with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, but this latter condition is more prevalent in late childhood and adolescence. Often an overlap exists between these two broad categories of medically intractable epilepsies; for example, TSC is commonly associated with generalized infantile spasms as well as with multifocal partial seizures. This overlap suggests that common features may exist in the pathogenesis of different epilepsy types during early brain development. Regardless of the epilepsy type, etiology, or syndrome, the mechanisms of epilepsies in infancy and early childhood likely differ significantly from those of epilepsies in older children and adults. These mechanistic differences have important implications for therapeutic strategy and therapeutic efficacy (2,3). The lack of appropriate animal models is a major impediment to a more complete understanding of pediatric epilepsy and to more effective treatments. Animal models serve numerous functions. They provide opportunities to investigate and elucidate basic mechanisms, to test and/or develop new antiepileptic medications (AEDs) and other therapeutic modalities, to devise new diagnostic approaches, and to study the neurologic consequences of seizures at various stages of brain development (4–7). Given the many (and often significant) differences between human and animal (i.e., rodent) brain structure and developmental profiles, no animal model is likely to reproduce faithfully every aspect of a human epilepsy syndrome. However, the insightful use of such models can play a pivotal role in generating hypotheses about the mechanisms, pathogenesis, and consequences of seizures in the developing brain, and for testing potential therapies. This report summarizes discussions held during a workshop on Models of Pediatric Epilepsies, held in Bethesda, MD, on May 13–14, 2004. The Workshop was sponsored by NINDS/NIH and supported by grants from the American Epilepsy Society and the International League Against Epilepsy. Whereas previous NIH workshops have examined general priorities for epilepsy research (8,9), the current Workshop focused explicitly on epilepsies in the developing brain. Invited participants included clinical pediatric epileptologists, basic epilepsy researchers, and developmental neurobiologists (Appendix A). The general goals of the Workshop are shown in Table 1. They arose from the following questions: Given the wide diversity of seizure types presenting at different developmental ages, certain clinical questions must be considered (i.e., what clinical problems are most pressing and what additional information is needed to guide model development? Are clinical disorders sufficiently well defined to provide guidance for the laboratory researcher attempting to model a human clinical condition? How do we deal with the observation that, in humans, numerous etiologies can cause the same epilepsy syndrome (and, in some cases, a given etiology will result in different seizure phenotypes)? What is presently known about existing models of catastrophic generalized epilepsy and intractable partial epilepsy? Why has it been so difficult to develop models of pediatric epilepsies? Challenges to development of animal models of pediatric epilepsy include the uncertainty of what constitutes analogous developmental ages in humans and experimental animals (especially rodents), vast interspecies differences in the rate and patterns of brain growth and neuronal maturation, and dissimilarities of seizure phenotypes and EEG manifestations seen across different species. A goal of the Workshop was to derive recommendations on the use of current (and future) animal models, including suggestions about the appropriateness of different species, genetic background, seizure etiologies, and other clinically relevant variables. How can we generate specific modeling targets, and what criteria can we use for “validating” the models? Although broad agreement was reached that catastrophic generalized epilepsies and intractable focal epilepsies are important targets for model development, many questions remained about how to prioritize these targets (pressing clinical need? highest likelihood of rapid returns? pathophysiologic relevance?). Given the complexity of the clinical conditions in question, what subset of experimentally approachable features should to be reproduced in useful models? What are the bases for accepting or rejecting these models as clinically relevant/useful? What conceptual and technologic advances would facilitate our attempts to understand developmental epilepsies? Technologic developments, development of modeling approaches at different levels (computer simulations, tissue-culture preparations, intact animals), and consideration of animals species not currently exploited for model development may be key directions for future progress. Finally, how can we establish networks of collaboration among laboratories involved in pediatric epilepsy research, and how can our limited resources be maximized? To facilitate model development, a variety of common strategies can and should be used. A more complete understanding of salient clinical features (e.g., epidemiology, etiology, pathology, and natural history of intractable developmental epilepsies) will undoubtedly facilitate the generation of models with features that are clinically relevant. Toward this goal, it is necessary to elucidate the developmental progression of key biomarkers (e.g., neurotransmitters, membrane ion channels, subcellular signaling cascades), behavioral phenotypes, and numerous other factors to understand their relations to age-specific epilepsies. Age-related differences in neuronal plasticity and glial function are emerging as key modulators of pediatric epilepsy. Other avenues of potential importance are just beginning to receive experimental attention, such as the role of stress in epileptogenesis, the effects of seizure-induced acute and chronic inflammation, and subtle circuit reorganization associated with neurogenesis, axonal sprouting, and molecular plasticity. In any model of epileptic encephalopathy, a concerted effort should be made to determine long-term consequences of the neurobiologic abnormalities, including behavioral changes, cognitive dysfunction, and seizure susceptibility. In generating models of pediatric epilepsies, it is important to remember that in some children with an epileptic encephalopathy, the seizures themselves may be less impairing to the child than the associated cognitive deficits. In other cases, the seizures may exacerbate the cognitive deficits. Further, the effects of anticonvulsant drugs and other treatments on parameters of brain development and cognition must be considered in parallel with their effects on seizures themselves. Model development should involve, as a key goal, efficient means for the testing new anticonvulsant/antiepileptic (and even antiepileptogenic) medications, as well as for evaluating novel therapies such as special diets targeted to seizure control (e.g., ketogenic diet, low-glycemic-index diet), a variety of implantable stimulation devices (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation), and novel drug-delivery systems. These models should also allow us to test the potentially beneficial effects of environmental enrichments that may reduce the morbidity of epilepsy in children. The models should be useful for investigating if/how treatments might slow (or halt) the progression of epilepsy (antiepileptogenesis). The Workshop's recommendations with respect to general strategies for model development are shown in Table 2. Workshop participants defined an ideal model as one in which one or more aspects of human pediatric epilepsy could be studied, recognizing that inherent species differences preclude exact replication. To model a given type of pediatric epilepsy accurately, the investigator must be aware of the diversity of seizure manifestations and etiologies associated with the targeted human epilepsy syndrome. For example, what appear to be similar lesions may cause severe epilepsy in one patient and minor or no dysfunction in another. Seizures differ according to etiology, age at onset, genetic predisposition, EEG findings, treatment responsiveness, natural history, and numerous other factors. In the complex task of designing a clinically relevant animal model, two complementary approaches should be considered. An “intuitive” or “face-value” model attempts to replicate the human disease as closely as possible; this approach is likely to be high risk and may not readily yield insights into mechanism. Alternatively, a “reductionist” model isolates specific components of the pathophysiology and allows the investigator to study underlying mechanism; it may, however, provide limited data about clinically relevant behaviors and/or responses to treatment. As a first step in establishing criteria for an “ideal” model, the definition of epilepsy as unprovoked, recurrent seizures must be considered. Seizures induced immediately by chemical agents and electrical stimulation can yield important, age-specific mechanistic information. However, for a model to be truly “epileptic,” seizures should occur spontaneously, without provocation, during an appropriate age window. Worthy of consideration, however, are models in which only EEG abnormalities are apparent, or in which enhanced seizure-propensity occurs (which is manifest when the animal is challenged in some way). Second, the investigator should recognize that human epilepsy syndromes often involve multiple etiologies. An ideal animal model might incorporate similar etiologies, such as an acquired insult (trauma, fever) or a genetic mutation. In reality, it is unlikely that the most popular current methods used to induce seizures in animal models (e.g., kainic acid, pilocarpine, fever, hypoxia/ischemia) are “equivalent” to the factors that lead to human epilepsies. This lack of generalizability may affect our ability to “validate” a given model. However, because these factors can be experimentally manipulated, they give the investigator an opportunity to consider how such insults (or genetic factors) interact. Multiple insults, occurring at different times of development, may reflect a clinically realistic approach to generation of pediatric epilepsies. A third criterion for an ideal animal model is that the seizure phenotype of the model should resemble the phenotype of the seizure of interest in the humans, with site-specific behavioral manifestations. Whereas the focus of many epilepsy models has been on the hippocampus and neocortex, the brainstem and other brain regions should be considered, especially because many subcortically mediated behaviors may be critical for seizure manifestations in young rodents. Realistically, it is unlikely that rodent seizures, and particularly seizures in young rat or mouse pups, will fulfill this phenotypic ideal. It is our challenge to determine what seizure phenomena in rodents—behavioral and/or electrical—correspond to salient seizure phenomena in human infants and babies. Fourth, although species differences probably preclude an exact correlation between human and animal, EEG abnormalities should be present in the animal model; preferably, those EEG abnormalities should have common features with the human condition. For example, in the case of modeling infantile spasms (see later), specific interictal versus ictal EEG patterns (e.g., hypsarrhythmia vs. electrodecremental responses) would ideally be present in the animal model. Fifth, an ideal model would include responsiveness to syndrome-specific antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or other treatment modalities, as seen in the human disorder. Finally, the cognitive and behavioral consequences of seizures in an animal model should resemble those in the human syndrome. Long-standing uncertainty has existed as to whether seizures themselves cause brain damage and resultant neurologic/cognitive dysfunction, or whether underlying neurologic impairment leads to both seizures and cognitive consequences. Animal models maybe useful in sorting out these variables, because the animal-model approach offers the researcher a “normal” control brain as a starting point. Given that catastrophic epilepsies in the immature brain are relatively rare, one might argue that modeling resources could be better used to study more common—and easier-to-target—pediatric epilepsies. The Workshop participants were unanimous, however, in supporting the importance of developing a system in which we can more effectively study and treat catastrophic syndromes. Workshop participants discussed infantile spasms as an example of catastrophic generalized epilepsy, as this syndrome carries a particularly poor prognosis, and an optimal therapy does not exist (10). Infantile spasms is an age-specific epileptic encephalopathy, occurring primarily in the 4- to 10-month range. West syndrome consists of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia (on interictal EEG), and mental retardation. It may appear several months after virtually any insult to the developing brain, such as infection, cerebral dysgenesis, hemorrhage, or hypoxia–ischemia. Animal models of the human infantile spasms phenotype have been especially difficult to generate, perhaps because of our lack of understanding of the underlying causes and mechanisms. None of the recent attempts to model infantile spasms in animals has produced results that exactly “fit” the human syndrome (11). In addressing the question of what features would be important to reproduce in the animal, there was general agreement about the key characteristic factors required in an ideal model (Table 3), but considerable disagreement among Workshop participants about how to prioritize these targets. Certainly, it would be desirable to have seizures that resemble the spasms seen in infants, with sudden extension or flexion of the body, often occurring in clusters during sleep–wake transitions. Myoclonic seizures would be an alternative phenotypic target. Furthermore, an interictal EEG showing hypsarrhythmia, and an ictal electrodecrement EEG, would lend validity to the model. It was noted, however, that if hypsarrhythmia were defined to include the presence of multifocal, high-amplitude discharges, that pattern may be extremely difficult to document in a rat or mouse pup (where placement of multiple electrodes over the brain is limited by size and fragility). Therefore modeling of hypsarrhythmia may be restricted to larger animal models until technologic advances permit the development of “micro” electrode assemblies. An animal model of this disorder should also mimic cognitive stagnation or decline. Finally, the often-dramatic response in humans to administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) [or of vigabatrin (VGB) in a subpopulation], with resolution of both spasms and EEG abnormalities, would add credibility to a model. Various attempts to model infantile spasms in animals were discussed. One model involves intraventricular administration of picomolar amounts of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to neonatal rats (12), an interesting approach, given the peculiar response of infantile spasms to ACTH. Further, the perinatal stress caused by etiologies associated with infantile spasms has led to the hypothesis that stress may increase endogenous CRH levels in seizure-prone areas of the developing brain, leading to neuronal damage, axonal reorganization, long-term cognitive deficits, and possibly age-related seizures such as infantile spasms (13). The CRH-induced seizure phenotype (primarily “limbic”) and EEG abnormalities do not mimic features of infantile spasms. However, CRH-treated rats do display cognitive deficiencies. Although CRH-induced seizures are not responsive to ACTH, ACTH does reduce CRH gene expression in certain neuronal populations (14). Another attempt to model infantile spasms involves intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) in infant rats (15,16). This agent causes a clinical seizure described as emprosthotonus, consisting of whole-body tonic flexion with back-arching. Although EEG findings are variable, these seizures are often accompanied by a decrement of the EEG amplitude, resembling the electrodecremental response in the human EEG. However, interictal hypsarrhythmia is lacking, no spontaneous seizures have been recorded, and the seizures are not responsive to ACTH. Lennox–Gastaut syndrome is another age-specific human epileptic encephalopathy, consisting of intractable seizures of multiple types plus mental retardation. Lennox–Gastaut syndrome has also been resistant to animal modeling. The infantile spasms of West syndrome often evolve, as the infant develops, into the various seizure types associated with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. Investigators have focused on mimicking a single seizure type frequently seen in Lennox–Gastaut syndrome: atypical absence seizures (AASs) (17). Rats treated with an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis develop life-long recurrent episodes of bilateral synchronous slow spike–wave discharges (emanating from both hippocampi), characteristic of AAS; these discharges are associated with ictal clinical manifestations of staring and facial myoclonus. Later in life, these rats exhibit deficits in long-term potentiation and spatial learning and memory (18). These modeling attempts illustrate the difficulties that arise when trying to model a seizure type—and an epilepsy syndrome—as complex as infantile spasms and West syndrome. Clearly, one of the most difficult issues is the semiology of the seizures themselves. Infant rats (and mice) exhibit a variety of jerky movements and behaviors, especially during sleep (19), that can sometimes be confused with pathologic spasms. The differential occurrence of these spasm-like movements during wakefulness or sleep adds to the difficulty of the modeling challenge. Thus to be considered epileptic, any paroxysmal behaviors resembling spasms or myoclonus should be associated with an EEG seizure discharge. Ideally, a model of these pediatric epilepsy syndromes in mouse or rat would arise from some understanding of the pathophysiology underlying the disorder, an insight not yet achieved at the clinical level. The concept of “multiple hit” models of pediatric epilepsies was discussed in relation to model development for generalized catastrophic disorders. In some syndromes, epilepsy might occur as a consequence of two (or more) independent, but interdependent brain insults. An “acquired” insult (such as head trauma or hypoxia) may be superimposed on a background of genetic mutation; for example, mutation of the LIS1 gene (as seen in Miller–Dieker syndrome) is associated with neurodevelopmental pathology (20) and predisposes to infantile spasms. Such genetic-acquired two-hit models require further exploration. Whereas infantile spasms represents a generalized catastrophic epilepsy of childhood, other epilepsies appear to result from focal brain abnormalities and are reflected in partial seizures (for example, traumatic brain injury and developmental migration disorders that lead to cortical dysplastic lesions) (21,22). Discussion at the Workshop focused on TSC, a multisystem disorder often associated with refractory seizures (23); thus TSC can be considered an example of an intractable partial epilepsy of childhood. Epilepsy develops in >90% of children with TSC, and the severity of neurologic impairment in TSC is correlated with early onset of seizures (24). Because of the occurrence of multiple cortical tubers in a given patient, children may have one or several seizure foci that individually or together cause multifocal partial seizures and epileptic encephalopathy. Although significant progress has occurred in understanding the genetic and molecular basis of TSC (25), still little insight into the pathogenesis of epilepsy exists in this disorder. The ideal TSC model (Table 4) would replicate the genetic defect (TSC1 or TSC2 gene mutation), the structural brain abnormalities (cortical tubers and subependymal nodules), spontaneous seizures with EEG correlates, and cognitive deficits seen in human TSC. Although several animal models of TSC are known, none provides representation of all of these TSC components. The Eker rat has a spontaneous germline mutation in which one TSC2 allele is inactivated, resulting in abnormal TSC2 gene product (tuberin). Eker rats have renal tumors and subependymal nodules, but cortical tubers are not ordinarily observed, even in two-hit models in which a somatic insult is superimposed on the genetic mutation (26,27). Eker rats exposed to a second hit do have a higher number of dysmorphic neurons and exhibit some level of cortical disorganization, but do not exhibit spontaneous seizures (although Eker rats may have a decreased threshold to induced seizures). Recently, memory alterations have been documented in Eker rats (28). In contrast, modeling attempts in mice, using conditional knockout strategies, have given rise to animals with spontaneous seizures but without the neuropathologic features typical of TSC. For example, a mouse conditional knockout of TSC1 (the gene that codes for the protein hamartin), in which the deletion is driven by the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter, shows abnormal cortical excitability, astrocyte neuropathology, spontaneous seizures, and cognitive deficiencies (29,30). Complementary in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed decreased glutamate-transport currents and impaired uptake of potassium through inward rectifier channels (31), suggesting potential mechanisms for brain hyperexcitability in these mice. Still, the absence of cortical tubers weakens the validity of these mice as a model of the human disorder. Further work with the conditional genetic manipulation approach (e.g., using a neuron-specific promoter system) may provide additional insights and yield neuropathologic features that more closely resemble the pathology of TSC. A major need in developing appropriate models of pediatric epilepsy is a better knowledge base of the disorders in question. Laboratory research can contribute to that knowledge base through studies of human material from autopsy specimens as well as of surgically resected tissue. Such studies will provide a better understanding of the structural, molecular, and functional abnormalities underlying epileptic circuits. Clearly, however, this material is limited and rarely allows the experimenter to manipulate key variables. Thus animal models will continue to play a pivotal role in advancing knowledge about the developmental epilepsies (Table 5). The choice of species for these studies is critical, as species (and even strain) differences have been shown to result in very different susceptibilities to seizures and their consequences (32). The choice of rats and mice to model epilepsy phenomena has been based largely on experimental convenience and on the large background of information about brain function in these species. For studies of the genetic bases of epilepsy, mice will certainly continue to be a valuable resource (33); studies of human genetic mutations associated with pediatric epilepsy syndromes should be pursued in these versatile mouse systems. Rodents will also be helpful in assessing the roles of gender and hormones in developmental epilepsy (34). However, the sequence and rate of ontogenetic steps in rodent brain development differ in significant ways from human brain development; thus rodents may not always model epilepsy pathophysiology adequately. Consideration should also be given, therefore, to other animals such as primates and pigs, in which aspects of human brain development may be more precisely reproduced. For example, piglets are used extensively in neonatology laboratories, and experimental techniques for maintaining stable systemic parameters are well established in this field (35). In contrast, future model development should also take advantage of simple systems—such as zebra fish, flies, and invertebrates—in which large-scale, fast-throughput studies can screen for relevant genes and drug responsiveness, as well as address specific mechanistic issues (36). Workshop participants stressed the importance, particularly in these simpler systems (and in the in vitro preparations) of defining the seizure phenotype carefully. Finally, computer modeling represents a relatively untapped approach to explore certain questions of cellular and network function in pediatric epilepsies (37). In all such considerations of animal choice, the experimental question should determine the optimal approach. Extensive discussion was held regarding technical advances that might facilitate our study and understanding of pediatric epilepsies. At the top of the list (Table 5) was the development of reduced-scale (e.g., for rat and mouse pups) “neonatal intensive care units” that would allow concurrent monitoring of several aspects of neurologic function: video-EEG, motor activity, and blood pressure and respiration parameters. Metabolic parameters in young rodents, both during and between seizures, have been underemphasized in experimental work in this field; in particular, temperature measurement and its regulation are critical parameters that require assiduous attention in neonatal rodents (38). Another critical need is miniaturized systems for EEG recording, especially in freely moving animals. In the last several years, technical advances have made it possible to carry out both short- and long-term electrophysiologic monitoring of spontaneous seizures in adult rodents. However, it remains very difficult to record EEG reliably in rats younger than age postnatal day 10, and even more challenging to record from immature mice. Capabilities for small animal neuroimaging (in modalities such as MRI, functional MRI, and PET) will add significantly to the understanding of structural and functional substrates of epilepsy during development. Large-scale molecular screening techniques, including proteomics and gene profiling with microarrays, must be incorporated into experimental protocols for pediatric epilepsy studies. Finally, general agreement was reached about the urgent need to develop more precise methods for behavioral characterization and cognitive testing, to assess the long-term effects of seizures in (and on) the developing brain (39). One feature of the current Workshop was the participation of investigators working on pediatric models outside the epilepsy field (e.g., in genetics and neurogenesis, in brain development and plasticity, in sleep and mental retardation, and in pathologies associated with ischemia and traumatic brain injury). Investigators in these fields have developed modeling approaches and insights that should be incorporated into the epilepsy research arena. The sharing of such approaches, across fields and across laboratories, remains an untapped but potentially rich resource (Table 5). Innovative approaches to networking and collaboration, including web-based interactions, are needed. Such approaches would include resource “centers” that might be shared across institutions, such as rodent “neonatal intensive care units” (with video-EEG capability and apparatus for behavioral testing), neuroimaging facilities, and genetic profiling centers. Collaboration between networks of investigators, spanning the spectrum of clinical and basic research, is essential for substantial progress in the pediatric epilepsy field. The recent study by Dzhala et al. (40), which identified a novel treatment for neonatal seizures, represents an example of fruitful collaboration between institutions, involving the integration of data from human autopsy material and animal investigations (both in vivo and in vitro). The ready availability of web-based information, tissue-distribution resources, and genetic models make interinstitutional projects not only necessary but obviously feasible. Comprehensive discussion about funding resources yielded a broad array of possibilities. We, as investigators, must convince traditional funding mechanisms (including NIH and private foundations) of the urgency of research on pediatric epilepsy disorders. In addition to the hypothesis-driven NIH R01 grants, model-driven grants through the R21 mechanism should be considered. Sources of funding for pilot grants include private foundations. A listing of these potential funding sources can be found under Resources in Epilepsy Research on the American Epilepsy Society website (http://www.aesnet.org/Visitors/Research/index.cfm). Workshop participants enthusiastically supported the idea of specific model development in the pediatric epilepsies. Even in this era of limited funding, advances in the field are not only scientifically feasible but also crucial for the optimal care of children with epilepsy. Over the long term, investments of time, resources, and scientific effort should be cost-effective in terms of health and human needs. Some of the issues discussed in this workshop stemmed from the NIH-Curing Epilepsy Conference report (developed in 2000), which identified specific gaps in our understanding of epilepsy and epileptogenesis, and set specific benchmarks of attainable goals (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/about_ninds/epilepsybenchmarks.htm). Many of these benchmarks focus specifically on a more complete understanding pediatric epilepsies and their underlying bases, so that we can develop better treatment options—and eventually “cures”—for these often devastating disorders.",

Es más común en mujeres adultas, pero se puede dar desde niños a adultos y hombres. La prevalencia es de 2.7% en la población general. La etiología en sí es desconocida, pero se clasifica como una sensibilización central por cambios neuroendocrinológicos en sistema nervioso central y periférico en individuos genéticamente susceptibles, en respuesta a desencadenantes ambientales, resultando en percepción del dolor aumentada e hipersensibilidad a numerosos estímulos. Se caracteriza por dolor musculoesquelético generalizado y sensibilidad de tejidos blandos, acompañado por fatiga, alteraciones del sueño, trastornos somáticos, cognitivos y psiquiátricos. Pueden existir trastornos coexistentes que estimulan o exacerban la sintomatología. El diagnóstico se basa en la historia clínica y síntomas, examen físico normal, estudios complementarios normales y criterios AAPT o 2010 CAR o de Yunus y Masi positivos. Se deben valorar posibles diagnósticos diferenciales según el grupo etáreo. El manejo se basa en educación, identificación de comorbilidades, ejercicio, terapia cognitiva conductual, fármacos como antidepresivos y anticonvulsivantes y terapias alternativas. Los pacientes tienen un deterioro en la calidad de vida y morbilidad, sin un aumento significativo en la mortalidad.",

      "title": "Major Depressive Disorder in Medical Illness: A Review of Assessment, Prevalence, and Treatment Options",
      "abstract": "Major depression, as well as other depressive disorders, is commonly comorbid with other medical illnesses, particularly chronic and systemic medical illnesses. The co-occurrence of the disorders is so common that it challenges our notions of the meaning of comorbidity and our desire to neatly separate psychiatric and medical illnesses. The overlap between symptoms of physical illness and the neurovegetative symptoms of major depression and the initial normative emotional response to physical illness add to the challenge of accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of depression in the medically ill. We review the literature on the comorbidity of depression and the various medical illnesses, including diagnostic and treatment approaches. The differential diagnosis for major depression among medically ill patients should include delirium and medication-induced symptoms. We suggest that major depression itself may be best conceptualized as a systemic illness whose pathophysiology overlaps with other systemic medical illnesses. The initial treatment strategies for major depression in medical illness are like those for the general population; however, the comorbid medical illnesses may interfere with remission. To illustrate these points, we describe a patient with clinical characteristics covered in this review who experienced major depression as well as several chronic illnesses, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain due to degenerative joint disease, and diabetes mellitus.",

Many different disorders affecting many different parts of the nervous system can manifest with \"weakness,\" and several nonneurologic conditions may present with complaints of weakness. It is the job of the neurologist to determine whether a patient has neurologic weakness or suffers simply from fatigue. The physician then must properly localize the pathophysiologic site of weakness. The author focuses on neuromuscular causes of weakness affecting muscle, the neuromuscular junction, peripheral nerve, or the anterior horn cell. General historical and examination clues to localization will be discussed. A localization-based evaluation will be outlined, with more specific recommendations regarding the evaluation of a few specific disorders offered. Localization-specific laboratory, electrodiagnostic, imaging, and pathologic investigations will be presented.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which mainly affects women and young adults in their most productive years of life. Given to fact that the disease is unpredictable and has uncertain outcomes, the grater are physical and emotional efforts that an individual has to take, and that inevitably causes additional exhaustion. Assessment of disease severity based only on an objective clinical finding is not enough, because it does not give insight into the subjective experience of disease symptoms and difficulties with which these patients meet in everyday life life. Most MS sufferers most likely will experience a wide range of physical, psychological and social problems. Physical disability, fatigue, motor incapacity and sexual dysfunctions that occur with the progression of the disease, most often lead to the deterioration of the quality of life in people with MS. In addition to these factors, changes in psychological status are inevitable. Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity of MS that worsens the health condition of the patient. Studies on psychiatric comorbidities and ways of coping with MS generally highlight the connection between depression and alexithymia in MS. Prevalence alexithymia in MS patients goes up to 50%, it is associated with anxiety and significantly contributes to the severity and severity of depression. When it comes to the therapy of depression in MS of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) is recommended as the first line of treatment, but also the application of pharmacotherapy i.e. administration of sertraline and escitalopram with short-term use of alprazolam, and more recently, more and more studies are investigating neuroprotective effect of antidepressants, and recommend the use of fluoxetine. Directing preventive measures to improving social activities and prevention institutionalization ie. combining medical rehabilitation, psychosocial help and social support prevent that the disease from becoming a disability leading to complete isolation. It is also necessary to direct resources to adequate treatment of depression as determining factor of quality of life, mental health and prognostic factor of the clinical picture and course of MS.",

      "abstract": "The term dysautonomia refers to a change in autonomic nervous system function that adversely affects health. The changes range from transient, occasional episodes of neurally mediated hypotension to progressive neurodegenerative diseases; from disorders in which altered autonomic function plays a primary pathophysiologic role to disorders in which it worsens an independent pathologic state; and from mechanistically straightforward to mysterious and controversial entities. In chronic autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson disease), orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure from sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after “patchy” autonomic impairment or blood volume depletion or, as highlighted in this discussion, from a primary abnormality that augments delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart. Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys seems to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm that is associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, which rationalizes treatment with β-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between the chronic fatigue syndrome and orthostatic intolerance; however, treatment with the salt-retaining steroid fludrocortisone, which is usually beneficial in primary chronic autonomic failure, does not seem to be beneficial in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Dysautonomias are an important subject in clinical neurocardiology.",

Brain injury may also occur during the very vulnerable periods of rapid growth of the foetal brain from prenatal trauma/strokes, during a difficult birth, or postnatally from strokes, infections (e.g. meningitis and encephalitis), metabolic disturbances (e.g. phenylketonuria), treatment (e.g. central nervous system (CNS) surgery or radiotherapy for leukaemia) or toxins (e.g. alcohol and valproate). This paper concentrates on the assessment of and interventions following acquired brain injury sustained after the first 2 years of life, that is, after a period of relatively normal development when there has been an expectation that a child will follow the usual trajectory in development and learning throughout childhood and adolescence. Acquired brain injury in younger children tends to have global and profound effects, for instance, from CNS radiation (Said et al , 1989) or head injury (Levin et al , 1995). Injury in older children may result in more specific or focal problems depending on the mechanism of injury.",

Clinically it is characterized by spontaneously occurring pain as well as evoked pain. The latter generally presents either as allodynia (pain resulting from an innocuous stimulus) or hyperalgesia (an exaggerated pain response to a noxious stimulus) or more commonly both (Baron et al. 2010). These cardinal symptoms can be extremely resistant to treatment and as such chronic neuropathic pain persists in the individual and consequently in society as a major socioeconomic problem. Treatment strategies typically target neuronal mechanisms, and although there is clear evidence for a neuronal component in neuropathic pain, the lack of efficacy of these drugs is consistent with a more recent and growing body of evidence that nonneuronal mechanisms have a major functional contribution to the etiology of chronic pain states (Beggs and...",

La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente.

Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc.

      "title": "Symptomatic therapy in multiple sclerosis: Big pharma should do more—YES",
      "abstract": "1Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a wide variety of clinical phenotypes. This can range from asymptomatic to relapsing–remitting to progressive disease phases as well as an overlapping period in between each of these phases. Each phase can further be classified as being active or not active. 1 It is well known that patients may remain in each type indefinitely or for a variable period before progressing to the next clinical phenotype. Patients may develop residual neurological deficits either from the very beginning or later at any time during the course of the disease. Although a benign course may be seen in up to one-quarter of patients, even these may have some mild motor or sensory symptoms that may cause some discomfort, fatigue that may interfere with their daily living activities or cognitive changes leading to some limitations in their professional life. Most MS patients will end up having some residual neurological symptoms. Although the residual symptoms correlate with some disability steps in MS, this may not always be the case. For example, people without significant motor findings may also have other symptoms that, once properly managed, will ease that individual’s life. However, despite the large proportion of patients affected with a wide variety of neurologic symptoms, the number of available symptomatic treatments is limited and they are only partially effective. It is clear that some of these MS-related symptoms are not MS specific and may be seen as a result of other neurological (and non-neurological) disorders resulting in a much larger patient population that requires such therapies. Regarding the available symptomatic therapies and their efficacies, it becomes clear that this is a neglected area with a high need of new therapies. The emphasis in MS has almost always been on large trials to slow or eliminate the disability worsening by eliminating relapses or shortening the time to recovery after relapses. However, many patients still have residual symptoms after a relapse and continue to develop progressive symptoms despite the available treatments. Currently, there are 12 approved disease-modifying long-term therapies in MS; some others are expected to be approved soon and many more are in clinical trials. However, none offers a cure, but rather reduce clinical relapses and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) burden to a certain extent, with a less pronounced effect on long-term disability. These therapies continue to be effective in responders as long as they are used, but in some their efficacy may wear off over time. The higherefficacy disease-modifying therapies are also associated with more serious adverse events. So, it is clear that new treatments are needed for better long-term management of a progressive disease such as MS. The good news is that there are a large number of ongoing trials in this area, most sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.",

Common structural cerebral conditions causing patients to be admitted to the ICU include cerebral trauma (traumatic brain injury), cerebrovascular accidents (both ischaemic and haemorrhagic), and infections. Cerebral conditions with a structural basis occurring after admission to the ICU are not as common as functional abnormalities, such as delirium, and peripheral complications, such as critical illness neuropathy and myopathy. An understanding of brain physiology, in particular factors that control or influence intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) underpin much of the theory behind the management of acute brain injuries and syndromes.",

      "title": "P4‐254: Dementia in multiple sclerosis: is it Alzheimer's or a new entity?",
      "abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune multifocal inflammatory demyelinating disease with secondary neurodegeneration affecting predominantly females between 20-40 years. The clinical course over years is very variable. Milder cognitive dysfunctions in various conditions are very frequent in acute stage and in the further courses of the disease. Dementia is reported as a rare condition in MS. Rodriguez et al found in 1994 an incidence of 3,7 %. Over a period of 10 years we have investigated in our outpatient MS center the cognitive state of more than 400 MS patients for dementia according to the DSM IV classification and its correlation to MS. The main neuropsychological instrument was the Minimental Status Examination (MMSE). The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of our patients ranged from 0 (no signs, no disability) to 9 (bed ridden, helpless). In our data we classified 3 subtypes of dementia in MS (DMS). In DMS type 1 the cognitive decline is one of the main symptoms and develops early in the disease without marked motor symptoms. The DMS type 2 is associated with an malignant or chronic progressive course of MS itself. Therefore DMS type 2 developed in association with marked motor impairement later in the clinical course. In DMS type 1 and 2 a marked demyelination of the white matter and/or cortical involvement with brain atrophy, demonstrated by magnetic resonanz imaging is present. DMS type 3 is associated with older age with or without major motor disability. In these cases we found no clear correlation between the course and severity of MS and the dementia syndrome itself. In ptients with MS the development of dementia is very heterogenous. DMS type 1 and 2 are directly associated with the progression of the chronic autoimmune disease and the involvement of cortical and/or white matter structures. In DMS type 3 cases a comorbid condition with Alzheimer Dementia is discussed. It seems as DMS is not as rare as described in literature. Further epidemiologic studies are necessary to evaluate the incidence of DMS in a greater population",

It is suggested that the extent of such injury is unrelated to the magnitude of shock current and that the timing of the ldquodiffuse electrical injuryrdquo may be indefinitely delayed with respect to the time of the sustained shock. Other reports refer to possible shock injury mechanisms that manifest solely with neuropsychological symptoms. A critical examination of this literature reveals no mechanistic basis for the association of the proposed physical symptoms of diffuse electrical injury with remote injury. Additionally, serious errors in the stated methodology of the publications citing the existence of diffuse electrical injury cast doubt upon the scientific basis for the stated conclusions.",

Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migrana (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

Zu den atypischen Parkinson-Syndromen zählen die Multisystematrophie, die progressive supranukleäre Blickparese, die Demenz vom Lewy-Körper-Typ und die kortikobasale Degeneration. Unter den symptomatischen Parkinson-Syndromen sind die vaskulär- und neuroleptikainduzierten am häufigsten. Gegen die Diagnose eines idiopathischen Parkinson-Syndroms sprechen ein fehlendes Ansprechen auf L-Dopa und Zusatzsymptome wie z. B. eine zerebelläre Ataxie, Okulomotorikstörungen, Störungen des autonomen Nervensystems, Pyramidenbahnsymptome, Apraxie und eine frühe posturale Instabilität. Auch Fluktuationen des Bewusstseins und die Entwicklung einer Demenz im frühen Stadium des Erkrankungsverlaufs sprechen gegen ein IPS. Neben diesen klinischen Kriterien helfen strukturelle und funktionelle bildgebende Verfahren sowie Untersuchungen der L-Dopa-Sensitivität der Parkinson-Syndrome und des autonomen Nervensystems, die diagnostische Sicherheit zu erhöhen. In dieser Übersicht wird eine Empfehlung für das rationale diagnostische Vorgehen entworfen.",

These are, on the one hand, the physiological capacity and the emotional integration of the individual; and on the other hand, the degree of family involvement, the nature of job requirements, and even the particular community attitudes and legal (compensation laws) outlook in regard to employment of the handicapped.

Estas células son de gran importancia ya que llevan la información a los músculos del cuerpo. Debido a la degeneración de neuronas motoras piramidales en la corteza motora, neuronas del tallo cerebral y neuronas del asta anterior en la médula espinal inducen la aparición de enfermedades motoras que producen atrofia progresiva de los músculos. Así, cuando se dañan estas células nerviosas, se presentan diferentes enfermedades motoras “raras” como: la esclerosis lateral amiotrófica, la esclerosis lateral primaria, la atrofia muscular espinal, síndrome de Guillain-Barré, la atrofia muscular espinal-bulbar y el síndrome pospoliomielítico, entre otros. Las patologías motoras pueden tener un origen congénito, genético o ambiental (viral, por fármacos o esporádico). Aunque estas enfermedades motoras se consideran poco comunes, son de gran importancia ya que los pacientes no logran recuperarse por la progresión de la enfermedad, lo que conlleva al fallecimiento. Esta revisión, analiza una serie de estudios clínicos de los últimos 20 años en estas patologías motoras para comprender mejor su etiología, diagnóstico y tratamientos, como el uso de células madre en la producción de oligodendrocitos que producen mielina, el cual es un factor clave en las enfermedades motoras y la utilización de antioxidantes que pueden ser la clave para obtener resultados prometedores que tiene como objetivo mantener la esperanza de vida en los sujetos que las padecen.",

It is associated with pre-combat traumatic experiences and pathologic sequelae including mental and medical illness.An electronic search of the major behavioral science databases was conducted to retrieve studies detailing the social, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of MST and its relationship to psychiatric and medical illness.Studies indicate that military sexual trauma is related to an increase in psychiatric pathology, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance abuse and dependence, depression, anxiety, eating disorders and suicidal behavior. MST is also related to an increase in medical illness, primarily pain-related symptoms involving multiple organ systems, including gastrointestinal, neurological, genitourinary and musculoskeletal.MST is associated with an increased prevalence of mental and physical illness. Although there are some gender differences in the reported rates of MST and there may be some variables, such as prior traumatic experiences, that may make an individual more vulnerable to the psychiatric and medical sequela of MST, it is clear that MST is a major healthcare issue that affects both sexes and warrants further attention and an increase in clinical resources devoted to it. Some preventive measures for decreasing the prevalence of MST may include increasing education and legal prosecution of perpetrators in the military, and increasing access to mental health services for individuals who have suffered from MST.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of dementia increases with age. In rare cases, people younger than 65 years old are also affected, with substantial consequences for the professional life. The symptoms depend on the form of dementia and can vary individually. Impairment of short-term memory is not always in the foreground and other neurocognitive domains, such as the disturbance of executive functions can have a significant impact on the ability to cope with everyday life. Pathophysiologically, neurodegenerative dementias with the major forms of Alzheimer's dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia are distinguished from vascular dementias. Mixed forms are common. There is no curative treatment, but progression can be slowed by nonpharmacological measures and, especially in Alzheimer's dementia, by pharmacological treatment. Appropriate measures can promote independence and autonomy for as long as possible; however, in the course of the disease restrictions in the extended activities of independent living will initially occur, such as banking transactions, use of means of transport and, in the further course, also in the basic activities of daily living. Legal capacity and the ability to consent to health interventions are restricted sooner or later; however, this must always be evaluated for the specific situation and is not generally the case with the diagnosis of dementia. Instruments such as living wills, identification of a health care proxy, and advanced care planning should be used at an early stage. To decrease family caregiver burden with the increased risk of developing depression, supportive, accompanying measures and education are of great importance.Demenzen treten mit zunehmendem Lebensalter vermehrt auf. In seltenen Fällen sind auch jüngere Menschen betroffen, mit erheblichem Einfluss auf die Berufstätigkeit. Die Symptome hängen von der Demenzform ab und können individuell unterschiedlich ausgeprägt sein. Nicht immer steht die Störung des Kurzzeitgedächtnisses im Vordergrund, vielmehr können andere neurokognitive Domänen wie die Störung der Exekutivfunktion sich erheblich auf die Alltagsfähigkeit auswirken. Pathophysiologisch werden die neurodegenerativen Demenzen mit den wichtigsten Formen Alzheimer-Demenz, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz und frontotemporale Demenz abgegrenzt von den vaskulären Demenzen. Mischformen sind häufig. Eine kurative Therapie besteht nicht, die Progression kann jedoch durch nichtpharmakologische Maßnahmen und, insbesondere bei der Alzheimer-Demenz, auch durch pharmakologische Therapie abgebremst werden. Es gilt, die Selbstständigkeit und Autonomie betroffener Patienten zu fördern. Im Verlauf kommt es jedoch zunächst zu Einschränkungen in den erweiterten Aktivitäten der selbstständigen Lebensführung wie Bankgeschäften, Nutzung von Verkehrsmitteln und im weiteren Verlauf auch den basalen Funktionen der Selbsthilfefähigkeit. Geschäftsfähigkeit und Einwilligungsfähigkeit in Bezug auf gesundheitliche Eingriffe sind früher oder später eingeschränkt. Dies muss jedoch immer wieder für die konkrete Situation evaluiert werden und liegt nicht grundsätzlich mit der Diagnose Demenz vor. Frühzeitig sollten Instrumente wie die Patientenverfügung, Vorsorgevollmacht oder vorausschauende Gesundheitsplanung („advance care planning“) genutzt werden. Pflegende Angehörige sind häufig stark belastet und haben ein erhöhtes Risiko, an einer Depression zu erkranken. Daher sind unterstützende begleitende Maßnahmen von großer Bedeutung.",

The hallmark of the disease is multifocal bilateral symmetric lesions affecting the thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem tegmentum, cerebral white matter, and cerebellum. The etiology is unknown, but immune-mediated mechanism was suggested. We present a 12-year-old previously healthy girl who developed increased sleepiness progressing to stupor and coma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed the characteristic findings previously described in acute necrotizing encephalopathy. Her mental status improved dramatically with steroid treatment, and the MRI findings resolved completely within 6 months. Following the acute illness, she developed a complex neuropsychiatric disorder consistent with basal ganglia syndrome. (J Child Neurol 2001;16:461-462).",

La cirugia funcional ha adquirido gran relevancia en el tratamiento de las complicaciones motoras de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) avanzada, y menos conocida es la influencia de la estimulacion cerebral profunda (ECP) en los sintomas no motores (SNM). Objetivo. Revisar la bibliografia sobre ECP y SNM en la EP. Desarrollo. Los resultados de la cirugia funcional sobre los SNM de la EP son variables en los distintos estudios. Algunos sintomas mejoran -trastornos del sueno, dolor o disconfort, trastornos obsesivo-compulsivos- y empeoran o aparecen otros -fluencia verbal, apatia, aumento de peso-. En estudios aislados se encuentra mejoria en memoria de trabajo, secuenciacion visuomotora y razonamiento, algunos trastornos digestivos, genitourinarios, de termorregulacion y olfativos, y empeoran la memoria verbal (recuerdo diferido) y visuoespacial, la velocidad psicomotora y la funcion ejecutiva, mientras que otros sintomas -hipotension ortostatica- no muestran cambios. Existen otros factores, ademas de la estimulacion, que pueden modificar los SNM, como la vulnerabilidad preoperatoria individual, la disminucion de medicacion dopaminergica tras la cirugia, la propia EP y los cambios psicosociales. En pacientes con perfiles determinados pueden existir riesgos especificos -mayor riesgo de alteracion cognitiva en pacientes de mas de 69 anos o con alteracion cognitiva precirugia; mayor riesgo de depresion, mania o suicidio en pacientes con patologia psiquiatrica previa-. Conclusiones. Es necesario valorar el riesgo-beneficio individualmente para obtener resultados optimos con este tratamiento.

      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

Organic dissociative states are distinct from intoxication, amnestic disorder, frank delirium, or other organic mental disorders as specified in DSM-III and DSM-III-R, yet these diagnostic manuals have no inclusive category or coherent nosological approach to dissociative states not strictly psychogenic in etiology.

The most significant abnormality is that which is termed posthypoxic and/or postresuscitation encephalopathies whose nature has not been elucidated particularly at the cellular and molecular levels. It is emphasized that this involves brain abnormalities, which is a sequela of hypoxia or ischemia of systemic origin, rather than primary brain damages. In some patients who have sustained a severe hypoxic episode of any nature and recovered their psychoneurological status ever rapidly and rather fully, there may be an abrupt progressive deterioration of their neurological status in some days or months, which results in death or grave irreversible disability. It is concluded that not only do reparative and compensatory processes occur, but also there are phenomena of progressive degenerative changes in a primarily successfully resuscitated person or experimental animal in the central nervous system in the postresuscitation period. A classification of psychoneurological disorders in patients in the early postresuscitation period has been made and ways of their prevention or alleviation have been indicated.",

While depressive symptoms and syndromes are common among the medically ill, this study demonstrated the need for careful diagnostic assessment of older patients with depressive symptoms before initiating treatment that may itself convey significant risk. Sociodemographic and health characteristics of older men at higher risk for depression were also identified. Patients more likely to be depressed were over age 75 years, had less formal education, experienced cognitive dysfunction, suffered from more severe medical illness (particularly recent myocardial infarction), and had a history of psychiatric illness. Depressive symptoms were also common among patients with renal or neurologic diseases, those having a family history of psychiatric illness, the unmarried, and the more severely disabled. Given the impact of depression on recovery from medical illness, compliance with medical therapy, and costs of extended hospital stays, detection and treatment of this disorder are imperative.

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

      "abstract": "Les états de mal non convulsifs et confusionnels sont classiquement séparés en deux formes, l’état d’absence (EA) et l’état de mal partiel complexe (EMPC). Le diagnostic est difficile sur la base des seuls éléments cliniques et nécessite un électroencéphalogramme (EEG) d’urgence. L’EA ou « petit mal status » est la forme la plus fréquente d’états de mal non convulsifs et confusionnels. Il est caractérisé par une confusion fluctuante, d’intensité variable, souvent associée à des myoclonies périoculaires. L’EEG montre des décharges critiques généralisées qui cèdent sous benzodiazépines alors que la conscience se normalise. Les EA possèdent une importante hétérogénéité nosographique. Quatre groupes peuvent être individualisés : EA typiques s’inscrivant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie généralisée idiopathique, EA atypiques survenant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie généralisée symptomatique ou cryptogénique, EA « de novo » de l’adulte caractérisés par des facteurs de provocation toxiques ou métaboliques, EA avec éléments focaux s’observant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie partielle préexistante. Les EMPC temporaux sont caractérisés par des décharges temporales continues ou récurrentes et peuvent être organisés de façon cyclique, cette présentation étant caractéristique mais rare. Ils nécessitent un traitement énergique en raison de leur résistance et du risque de séquelles cognitives. Les EMPC frontaux constituent un défi diagnostique. Ils sont en effet souvent inauguraux, de présentation clinique déroutante et symptomatiques d’une lésion focale dans un cas sur trois. Nonconvulsive confusional status epilepticus is classically divided on the basis of the ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) into absence status (AS) and complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Based on clinical semiology alone, diagnosis is difficult and requires emergent EEG. AS is a polymorphic condition that can complicate many epileptic syndromes. Confusion of varying intensity is associated in half of the cases with bilateral periocular myoclonias. Clinical and EEG normalization is obtained after intravenous benzodiazepine injection. From a nosographic point of view, four types of AS may be recognized. Typical AS occurs as part of an idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Atypical AS occurs in patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic generalized epilepsies. “De novo” AS of late onset is characterized by toxic or metabolic precipitating factors in middle-aged subjects with no previous history of epilepsy. AS with focal characteristics occur in subjects with a preexisting or newly developing partial epilepsy, most often of extratemporal origin. Most cases are transitional forms between these four entities. CPSE is characterized by continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures, which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. Cyclic disturbance of consciousness characterizes CPSE of temporal lobe origin that requires vigorous treatment to prevent recurrence or cognitive sequelae. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, symptoms are unusual and patients should be documented extensively. A focal frontal lesion is revealed in one third of cases.",

Neurological lesions at different sections of the spinal cord can cause different grades of weakness and paralyses. The different imaging modalities help us to establish our diagnosis based upon their findings. They also help to distinguish neurological from non-neurological causes of muscular diseases. MRI is the gold standard imaging modality, but its inability to be performed at the bedside makes it disadvantageous. USG is the other modality which can be reliably used at the bedside to aid in diagnosis and treatment.",

      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es una enfermedad con sustrato cerebral organico que presenta no solo sintomas como delirios y alucinaciones, sino que supone tambien, de forma consistente, un deterioro en el funcionamiento cognitivo, afectivo, relacional y laboral. Si bien sabemos que la causa de la enfermedad es una afectacion cerebral, se desconoce, no solo la etiologia de dicha afectacion, sino el momento en que esta sucede, su posterior evolucion y los factores pronosticos. Una de las manifestaciones de esta afectacion cerebral, es el deterioro cognitivo. El deterioro cognitivo propio de la esquizofrenia se ha demostrado que no es difuso o generalizado, sino que afecta de forma diferencial y especifica a la atencion, memoria de trabajo, memoria y funciones ejecutivas, si bien es cierto que otras funciones que dependen del optimo funcionamiento de estas, van a verse secundariamente afectadas. Asi mismo, la literatura avala la asociacion de la gravedad de la afectacion cognitiva a la mayor presencia de sintomas negativos y a un peor desempeno social y laboral. El deficit cognitivo inherente a la enfermedad se ha podido observar tambien en familiares sanos de personas con esquizofrenia y en poblaciones de riesgo para desarrollar psicosis, por lo que determinados deficits cognitivos han sido conceptualizados como marcadores endofenotipicos de vulnerabilidad a la esquizofrenia. Una de las cuestiones aun sin resolver en relacion con el deterioro cognitivo en la esquizofrenia, es su evolucion a lo largo del desarrollo de la enfermedad, habiendose planteado como hipotesis alternativas, que su evolucion es estatica, o que sigue un curso de deterioro, lento, pero progresivo. Para tratar de responder a esta cuestion, se ha realizado un estudio de diseno transversal, con una muestra de 22 pacientes con una evolucion de la enfermedad entre uno y cinco anos, y 21 pacientes con diez o mas anos de evolucion de la enfermedad.",

These symptoms are found to be independent from other symptoms in longitudinal and cross-sectional assesments. The negative symptoms are named as primary or idiopathic if they are present at beginning of the disease or if it is specific to the disease. If they are due to positive symptoms, drug adverse effects or depression they are named as secondary negative symptoms. Treatment approach depends on whether negative symptoms are primary or secondary. Deficit syndrome is described by primary negative symptoms presenting at the beginning of disease, emerging spontaneously and staying stable during the disease course. Recent reports showed that deficit syndrome differ on disease course based on neurocognitive measures, functioning, and structural imaging. The role of negative symptoms in clinical diversity of schizophrenia was aimed to be evaluated in this paper by elobarating negative symptoms in various dimensions such as clinical features, biological measures, quality of life, and response to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Dementia disorders are syndromes of cognito-emotional impairment which are disabling and longstanding. Subgroups of dementia are idiopathic dementias or primary degenerative dementias, vascular dementias and secondary dementias. Neurochemical investigations of postmortem human brain material have shown multiple changes in the neurotransmitter metabolism in patients with Alzheimer''s disease (AD) and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT). The cholinergic system is severely disturbed, but also the serotonin system and the catecholamines are disturbed. Reduced concentrations of neuropeptides have also been reported in AD/SDAT. It is obvious, however, that in brains from Alzheimer-afflicted patients, there are also disturbances in gangliosides and white matter components. At present, it is not possible to single out one of these changes as of special importance for the dementia disorder. The recorded neurochemical changes in brains from patients with AD/SDAT must, at present, be assumed to be secondary phenomena to a more fundamental disturbance, the nature of which we still do not know. Another explanation may be that the group AD/SDAT is a heterogeneous group, including several from an etiopathological point of view different disorders. In vascular dementia, there seem to be subgroups, and the multi-infarct dementia (MID) is only one of these. In a non-MID vascular group, there are general neurochemical disturbances in the form of reduced activity of cholineacetyl transferase and concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Although the neurochemical changes in dementia disorders are looked upon as secondary phenomena, they are of pathogenetic importance. Significant correlations have also been shown between neurotransmitter disturbances and behavioral symptoms. Thus, the neurochemical changes form a basis for formulating treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Anti‐immunoglobulin‐like cell adhesion molecule 5 (IgLON5) disease is an autoimmune encephalitis that targets the cell adhesion molecule, IgLON5. The disease presents with various clinical features, including sleep disorders, bulbar palsy, movement disorders, cognitive dysfunction and neuromuscular manifestations. Sleep disorders are characterized by parasomnias and sleep‐disordered breathing (stridor and sleep apnea). Bulbar palsy includes dysarthria, dysphagia, vocal cord paralysis and stridor. Movement disorders include a variety of symptoms and signs, such as chorea, dystonia, rigidity, tremor, myoclonus and myorhythmia. Cognitive dysfunction includes executive dysfunction, impairment of attention, and verbal and visual memory dysfunction. Neuromuscular manifestations include fasciculations in the tongue and peripheral muscles, limb weakness, and muscle atrophy. Some patients resemble those with neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. On video polysomnography, undifferentiated non‐rapid eye movement sleep and poorly structured N2 sleep are characteristic. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies are often normal or non‐specific. Human leukocyte antigen testing shows that HLA‐DRB1*10:01‐DQB1*05:01 is highly associated with the disease. Pathologically, neuronal deposition of both hyperphosphorylated 3‐repeat and 4‐repeat tau isoforms, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the hypothalamus, brainstem tegmentum, and upper cervical cord are observed. Some patients are responsive to immunotherapies, such as steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange therapy and rituximab. Factors associated with a favorable response to immunotherapies include early initiation of treatment, cerebrospinal fluid inflammation and immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) predominance of IgLON5 antibody compared with immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4). Anti‐IgLON5 disease should be suspected in patients with atypical movement disorders complicated by sleep disturbances.",

Bij kinderen met CP kunnen problemen op het gebied van visuele waarneming in het oog en/of in de hersenen gelokaliseerd zijn. Oculaire Visuele Inperking (OVI) heeft betrekking op die vormen van slechtziendheid welke samenhangen met oogheelkundige aandoeningen. Cerebrale Visuele Inperking (CVI) kan omschreven worden als een visuele stoornis als gevolg van al dan niet aantoonbare schade aan een of meerdere hersengebieden na het chiasma opticum of aan slechtziendheid waar geen oculaire verklaring voor bestaat. CVI kan veroorzaakt worden door het hypoxische-ischemisch letsel. Daarnaast kunnen prematuriteit, hydrocefalus, epilepsie en beschadigingen aan het centraal zenuwstel, CVI tot gevolg hebben. De klinische symptomen van CVI kunnen zich manifesteren in onder andere visueel sensorische symptomen, oculomotorische symptomen en hogere visuele symptomen. Een ander opvallend kenmerk is verminderde gezichtsscherpte zonder oogheelkundige verklaring. CVI kan samengaan met oogheelkundige afwijkingen zoals strabismus, optische atrofie en nystagmus. Daarnaast doen visuele problemen zich met name voor op het gebied van de hogere cognitieve processen als herkenning, orientatie, diepte-perceptie, gelijktijdige perceptie van beweging en visuele waarneming. Kinderen met CVI kunnen bijvoorbeeld moeite hebben met het vinden van de looproutes en de overgang van licht naar donker. Als gevolg van CVI kunnen functioneringsproblemen in het dagelijks leven ontstaan maar ook problemen in het gedrag en motorische ontwikkeling van kinderen. Deze problemen kunnen op verschillende manieren tot uiting komen omdat CVI samen kan voorkomen met andere problemen, zoals gedragsproblemen, epilepsie of problemen op het gebied van aandacht en concentratie.",

The main factors inducing the pain to become chronic are individual factors, psychological factors or socio-professional factors. The socio-professional factors are often much more influential than the physical factors. The overwhelming element of treatment is physical exercise.

      "abstract": "As the field of movement disorders has developed and matured over the past 25 years, psychogenic movement disorders have become increasingly recognized in subspecialty clinics. The diagnosis can be challenging and should be based on positive features rather than a purely exclusionary approach. The clinical phenotype can be quite varied, although certain categories of abnormal movement are more common than others. Electrophysiological studies may be particularly useful in establishing the diagnosis, especially with respect to tremor and myoclonus, and an argument can be made for adding a \"laboratory-supported definite\" category to earlier classification schemes. The diagnosis of psychogenic dystonia remains a major challenge, although there are some recent promising developments with respect to the evaluation of cortical plasticity that require further study. The pathogenesis of psychogenic movement disorders is poorly understood; insights may be provided from the study of other neurological conversion disorders such as psychogenic hemiparesis. Psychogenic movement disorders typically result in considerable disability and negatively impact quality of life to the same or greater extent than do many organic movement disorders. Treatment is extremely challenging, and many patients experience chronic disability despite various therapeutic interventions. Given the personal and societal impact of these problems, further advances in our understanding of their pathogenesis and the subsequent development of effective therapies are sorely needed.",

Seizures starting in the first year of life including the neonatal period might have a favorable course, such as in infants presenting with benign familial neonatal epilepsy, febrile seizures simplex or acute symptomatic seizures. However, in some cases, the onset of seizures at birth or in the first months of life have a dramatic evolution with severe cerebral impairment. Seizure disorders starting in early life include the \"epileptic encephalopathies\", a group of conditions characterized by drug resistant seizures, delayed developmental skills, and intellective disability. This group of disorders includes early infantile epileptic encephalopathy also known as Ohtahara syndrome, early myoclonic encephalopathy, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, infantile spasms syndrome (also known as West syndrome), severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (also known as Dravet syndrome) and, myoclonic encephalopathies in non-progressive disorder. Here we report on seizures manifesting in the first year of life including the neonatal period. Conditions with a benign course, and those with severe evolution are presented. At this early age, clinical identification of seizures, distinction of each of these disorders, type of treatment and prognosis is particularly challenging. The aim of this report is to present the clinical manifestations of each of these disorders and provide an updated review of the conditions associated with seizures in the first year of life.",

However, despite using this strategy, no cause is found in some axonal polyneuropathies, leading to the concept of chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affects the peripheral nervous system, but is also characterized by central nervous system involvement: it is a strictly motor disorder affecting both the first and second motor neurons, usually presenting during the sixth or seventh decade.

      "abstract": "Abstract Capacity assessments are performed when there is suspicion that a person is unable to adequately care for their physical, medical, or financial well‐being. The purpose of these assessments is to inform the legal system as to whether or not guardianship may be necessary. It is well established that certain mental illnesses, such as neurocognitive disorders (dementia) or psychotic disorders (like schizophrenia), may diminish capacity and, in some cases, lead to the need for establishment of a legal guardian. However, personality disorders are another common category of mental illness which may impair decision‐making. There is very little information in the literature about how or why these disorders could impair capacity, and thus, it can often be difficult to discern whether clients with personality disorders are substantially unable to care for themselves—versus unwilling to act in a way contrary to their ingrained habits. We present a series of three cases in which clients are determined to lack capacity primarily mediated by a personality disorder diagnosis. They are demonstrated to have mild deficits in cognitive functioning, but they show impaired decision‐making out of proportion to these deficits. In all three cases, it is apparent that the personality disorder is substantially impairing their ability to care for themselves. Discussion includes consideration for ways to incorporate evaluations of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and personality considerations into capacity assessments, and how to approach recommendations (such as guardianship vs. less restrictive option) based on both level and scope of impairment.",

Es zeigt sich, dass das Vorhandensein kognitiver Beeinträchtigungen einen wesentlichen Risikofaktor darstellt, nicht mehr beruflich reintegriert werden zu können. Zusätzlich zu den kognitiven Symptomen treten nach einer aSAB auch gehäuft psychiatrische Symptome wie Angst, Depression und Fatigue auf. Diese wirken sich zusätzlich zu den körperlichen und kognitiven Beeinträchtigungen negativ auf die Teilhabe am beruflichen und sozialen Leben aus, was wiederum zu einer schlechteren Lebensqualität beiträgt.",

      "abstract": "The scientific literature on injury to the brain or spinal cord is enormous, and grows annually. Yet the results are mostly clinical in nature, and often refer to unrepresentative groups of patients selected for study because of special medical conditions. The few epidemiological reports are problematic as well because of methodologic problems and inconsistencies that hinder the comparison of results. Most investigations concerning \"head injury\" are really about brain injury. In some reports, however, it is unclear whether the authors intended to study brain injury or head injury. Determining brain injury severity has been a long-standing problem. For decades, various systems were employed, and most were nonreproducible because of their subjective nature. Duration of unconsciousness was one of the most consistently used criteria to judge severity, because it was positively correlated with diffuse brain damage. A spinal cord injury that results in loss of motor or sensory function is one of the most catastrophic medical conditions recognized.",

      "title": "Ask About Daytime Sleepiness!",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is being recognized increasingly as a significant public health problem.1 Sleep loss or inadequate sleep time is the most common cause of EDS in the general population.1–3 Primary sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, and periodic leg movements in sleep are prevalent, particularly among older persons, and can contribute to EDS.4 Other medical conditions, such as cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, psychiatric illness, chronic pain syndromes, and several neurologic and neurodegenerative disorders, can disrupt sleep and lead to EDS. Moreover, widely prescribed medications, including diuretics, antihypertensives, sympathomimetic agents, corticosteroids, sedative-hypnotics, analgesics, and certain antidepressants, can cause EDS by interfering with sleep continuity and/or by having a direct sedating effect in the daytime. The adverse consequences of EDS are numerous. Irrespective of the underlying cause, hypersomnolence is associated with neurocognitive deficits, including decrements in attention, vigilance, and memory.5 Evidence also supports a strong association between EDS and an increased risk for domestic, work-related, and motor vehicle accidents.6,7 Impaired general health status and limitations in activities of daily living are yet other common sequela.8,9 Furthermore, landmark epidemiologic studies such as the Honolulu Heart Program and the Cardiovascular Health Study have associated EDS with a higher prevalence of heart disease, congestive heart failure, and dementia.10,11 The important report by Newman et al. in this issue extends our understanding by documenting an independent association between EDS and incident cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. In addition, the gender differences noted in the current investigation are consistent with previous reports of the high prevalence of sleep complaints among women and with the association of sleep disordered breathing with increased mortality in women in the nursing home setting.12 The causal pathway between EDS and morbid events, including cognitive dysfunction, accidents, and impaired quality of life, is readily envisioned. The occurrence of brief “microsleeps” and even prolonged sleep episodes in the daytime can decrease vigilance and lead to compromised performance at home, work, or during safety-sensitive tasks such as driving. Moreover, the inability to maintain wakefulness during the day can have a deleterious influence on social functioning and can lower one's sense of well-being. See also p 115 Yet unresolved, however, are the mechanisms through which EDS relates independently to cardiovascular end-points and mortality. At least three different causal pathways are proposed. First, it is possible that the increased morbidity and mortality associated with EDS are a function of underlying sleep disorders that cause EDS. It is well established that sleep-disordered breathing is prevalent in the general population. In middle-aged adults the prevalence is estimated to be at least 2 to 4%, and in certain subgroups it may be much higher.13 Several investigators have shown that the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing increases with age, with estimates that perhaps 30 to 40% of older individuals may have this chronic disorder.12,14,15 Recent work indicates that the frequency of disordered breathing events, severity of associated oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and degree of sleep fragmentation contribute independently to the occurrence of EDS.16 Clinic- and population-based studies have also shown an association between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension and prevalent cardiovascular disease independent of the effects of age, gender, smoking, and obesity.17 Therefore, in this setting, morbidity and mortality caused by EDS reflect underlying primary sleep disorders that are, in turn, associated with cardiovascular end-points and mortality. Second, many of the chronic medical conditions that are prevalent in older people, such as coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, emphysema, and depression, can be related indirectly to EDS through their interference with nocturnal sleep quality. It is now appreciated that congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease can predispose to sleep-disordered breathing, which can potentially exacerbate the predisposing condition.18,19 As with the occurrence of a primary sleep disorder, EDS in this setting is merely a surrogate marker for these chronic ailments, Third, it is possible that EDS has a direct role, through an undefined mechanism, in increasing morbidity and mortality, independent of either underlying primary sleep disorders or other recognized chronic medical illnesses. Experimental sleep deprivation studies in normal volunteers demonstrate a heightened sympathetic drive with elevated levels of circulating catecholamines.20,21 Extensive data indicate that sleep deprivation is also linked with significant alterations in the neuroendocrine axis characterized by an increase in serum Cortisol levels and a slower rate of daylong decline following the early morning circadian elevation.21,22 In the context of multiple chronic illnesses that are common among older adults, such neurohumoral alterations can increase further the probability of precipitating adverse events and require further delineation. Daytime sleepiness is assessed either objectively or subjectively. Objective methods include the multiple sleep latency test and the maintenance of wakefulness test.21–24 The former is used commonly in the clinical setting and many consider it to be the gold standard for the assessment of sleepiness. Subjective methods utilize self-report to identify sleep propensity and include validated questionnaires such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale.24,25 Since patients often underestimate their own degree of sleepiness, validated questionnaires addressing the likelihood of feeling drowsy or falling asleep during specific activities are more effective than general inquiries regarding the presence or absence of EDS. Moreover, questions about specific sleep-wake habits and input from family members, bed partners, and/or caregivers can provide a more accurate estimate of the degree and functional impact of EDS. In their study, Newman et al. use a general inquiry for identifying sleep-related problems and daytime sleepiness, raising the possibility of some degree of misclassification in their exposure variable (i.e., daytime sleepiness). In another recent prospective population-based study, the presence of self-reported snoring and general EDS was associated with total death rate and cardiovascular mortality. This effect was age-dependent and persisted after adjustment for body mass index, history of hypertension, cardiac disease, and diabetes. Interestingly, isolated snoring or hypersomnolence were not associated with increased mortality.26 In each of these investigations, the use of validated questionnaires to assess EDS and information regarding the presence of documented sleep-related disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing) would have been invaluable in examining the true independent effect of EDS on cardiovascular endpoints and all-cause mortality and the pathogenesis of this relationship. Newer initiatives sponsored by the National Institutes of Health have addressed some of the limitations of these important initial studies. The Sleep Heart Health Study, a multi-site longitudinal cohort study, is investigating the links between sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular endpoints.27 Until such prospective data clarify these relationships, we believe that currently available evidence supports the simple, noninvasive measure of asking our patients about their sleep and, in particular, about the presence of inappropriate hypersomnolence. All healthcare professionals have an important role in recognizing EDS as a sign and symptom that is amenable to effective treatment, The time-honored notion that somnolence is an expected (and accepted) concomitant of normal aging requires reevaluation: EDS that intrudes on daytime function not only compromises the quality of life but may also threaten lifespan. Despite the high prevalence of primary and secondary sleep problems among older persons, health professionals have often not prioritized the sleep history essential to recognition of potentially treatable conditions, and an important opportunity for health promotion is lost.28 We can and must do better.",

The emotional outcome most often associated with stroke is depression (or depressed mood), and its frequency after stroke has led some to suggest that post-stroke depression is a distinct type. The increased recognition of mood disorders, behavioural changes, and cognitive impairment and their effects on patients, has resulted in the development of new interventions, a greater number of professionals skilled to intervene, and increased research evidence on intervention effectiveness. Psychological disorder and distress continue to be under-recognised, some disorders are incorrectly diagnosed and treated, and the relative lack of a research base means that nurses and doctors may be treating disorders in their patients without much certainty about the effectiveness of the interventions.

      "title": "Autoimmune mediated suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "There is a known autoimmune disease, which is called ‘anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis’, or ‘Dalmau encephalitis’ (named after its discoverer). It is associated with the presence of high titers of antibodies to a certain epitope of the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors in the blood and/or in the cerebrospinal fluid. This disease in its classic form is accompanied by severe mental (depression, delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, catatonia, etc.) and neurological (convulsions, dyskinesias) symptoms, disturbances of consciousness and autonomic regulation (regulation of respiration, temperature, blood pressure, heart rhythm), as well as with suicidality, which seems to be disproportionate to the severity of mental disturbances. However, there are also ‘non-classical’ forms of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. These can manifest with exclusively psychiatric symptoms (for example, depression, psychosis, suicidal behavior), without characteristic neurological symptoms and/or disorders of autonomic regulation. In some of these cases, the correct diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was delayed by months, years or even decades. In addition, in recent decades, increasing evidence had accumulated that in some patients with so-called ‘classical’ mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depressive disorders – and especially in those who show resistance to traditional psychopharmacotherapy – elevated titers of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies can be detected in their blood and/or in their cerebrospinal fluid. It has also been shown that elevated blood titers of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies are often detected in post-mortem examinations of suicide victims. Anti-NMDA receptor antibody titers in psychiatric patients correlate well with a recent history of suicide attempts and/or with current active suicidal ideation. Some of these patients may benefit from aggressive immunosuppressive therapy that is similar to the regimens normally used to treat ‘classical’ anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with neurological and autonomic manifestations. This might stop their suicidal ideation and/or help in overcoming their resistance to psychopharmacotherapy. This article presents a description and analysis of three clinical cases of patients with various mental disorders, acute suicidality and elevated titers of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies, in whom such therapy has been effective.",

The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate.

      "title": "Contributions to Psychiatry of Recent Studies on Sleep",
      "abstract": "RésuméUne revue de quelques-unes des contributions les plus récentes des études sur le sommeil à la psychiatrie a été présentée. Les effets d'une privation de sommeil dépendent de plusieurs facteurs tels que l'âge, la prise de médicaments, l'état de santé physique et psychologique du sujet et le type de privation (total versus sélectif). Il peut y avoir atteinte des fonctions affectives, cognitives, sensori-perceptuelles, musculo-squelettiques et autonomes. Certains chercheurs pensent que l'état obtenu à la suite d'une privation prolongée de sommeil est un véritable état psychotique tandis que d'autres pensent que des sujets normaux peuvent endurer sans trop de mal une perte prolongée de sommeil; mais un comportement psychotique marqué a été noté chez des sujets ayant des traits de personnalité prédisposants et des patients schizophrènes reconnus ont montré une réactivation de leurs symptômes. Dans la plupart des cas, une privation totale du sommeil provoque une diminution des pulsions tandis qu'une privation sélective augmente ces pulsions et accroît l'excitabilité du système nerveux central. Les personnes présentant une insomnie fonctionnelle, en plus de se plaindre de problèmes communs aux gens âgés, présentent des profils polygraphiques de sommeil semblables à ceux des gens âgés, mais reposant vraisemblablement sur une base physiologique différente. Jusqu'à maintenant, ces études polygraphiques n'ont permis de déterminer aucune caractéristique qui permettrait de différencier une dépression réactionnelle-névrotique d'une dépression psychotique. En ce qui concerne la majorité des états dépressifs, les chercheurs notent de façon générale, une latence accrue dans l'apparition du sommeil, des réveils fréquents, un temps réduit de sommeil total, un raccourcissement de la phase 4 et un allongement du sommeil de la phase avec mouvements oculaires (PMO) (tel qu'il peut être observé dans les cas de dépression induits par la réserpine). Les patients atteints de manie montrent une réduction du temps de sommeil total, un raccourcissement de la phase 4 et du sommeil PMO. On a rapporté chez les schizophrènes aigus une réduction du temps de sommeil total, un raccourcissement du sommeil PMO, un accroissement de l'activité de pointes ponto-géniculo-occipitales (P.G.O.) et une absence du phénomène de “rebound” PMO notée habituellement après privation du sommeil PMO. Des observations similaires ont été effectuées sur des chats préalablement traités avec p-chloro-phenylalanine (un inhibiteur de la synthèse de sérotonine); certains traits de comportement présentés par ces animaux ont été qualifiés de “psychotiques” par certains chercheurs. Comparativement aux cas aigus, les patients schizophrènes chroniques montrent un même accroissement de l'activité de pointes P.G.O. mais une privation de sommeil PMO amène un “rebound” exagéré. Les patients présentant des états confusionnels aigus, de l'hallucinose ou du delirium tremens causés par des agents métaboliques toxiques ou l'alcool montrent un accroissement de sommeil PMO après disparition de l'agent toxique. Généralement, les patients présentant des syndromes cérébraux chroniques et un état de démence montrent une réduction du temps de sommeil total, une réduction du temps de sommeil PMO et un accroissement ou une réduction du sommeil à ondes lentes. Dans les cas de retard mental, on a trouvé une plus grande proportion de sommeil PMO (par rapport au sommeil total) que chez les sujets normaux. L'énurésie nocturne, le somnambulisme, les cauchemars et la terreur nocturne se produisent habituellement durant un éveil (“arousal”) survenu dans la phase des ondes lentes. Les sédatifs, les phénothiazines et les antidépresseurs provoquent une réduction de temps de sommeil PMO. La réserpine, les tranquillisants mineurs et particulièrement les psychomimétiques provoquent un allongement du sommeil PMO. On a discuté de quelques hypothèses plausibles concernant la pathophysiologie de certains désordres psychiatriques et les mécanismes d'action des mesures thérapeutiques.",

      "abstract": "Aim Clinical staging in psychiatry aims to classify patients according to the severity of their symptoms, from stage 0 (increased risk, asymptomatic) to stage 4 (severe illness), enabling adapted treatment at each stage of the illness. The staging model would gain specificity if one or more quantifiable biological markers could be identified. Several biomarkers reflecting possible causal mechanisms and/or consequences of the pathophysiology are candidates for integration into the clinical staging model of psychiatric illnesses. Methods This review covers the evolution (from stage 0 to stage 4) of the most important brain functioning impairments as measured with electroencephalography (EEG), in psychosis spectrum and in severe mood disorders. Results The present review of the literature demonstrates that it is currently not possible to draw any conclusion with regard to the state or trait character of any of the EEG impairments in both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. As for schizophrenia, the most promising markers of the stage of the illness are the pitch mismatch negativity as well as the p300 event‐related potentials, as these components seem to deteriorate with increasing severity of the illness. Conclusions Given the complexity of major psychiatric disorders, and that not a single impairment can be observed in all patients, future research should most likely consider combinations of markers in the quest for a better identification of the stages of the psychiatric illnesses.",

Das Vorliegen der einen scheint das Risiko zur Entwicklung der jeweils anderen Störung zu erhöhen. Obwohl das Delir gerade bei älteren Patienten eine häufige Störung ist, wird es oft übersehen. Zur Diagnostik des Delirs reichen aber nicht selten eine genaue Anamnese inklusive Medikamentenanamnese, klinische Untersuchung und Bestimmung von laborchemischen Routineparametern aus. Die kausale Behandlung des Delirs ist möglich und nicht unbedingt kompliziert. Zur symptomatischen Behandlung stehen nicht-medikamentöse und medikamentöse Maßnahmen zur Verfügung. Die nicht-medikamentösen Maßnahmen werden zu einem großen Teil vom pflegenden Personal ausgeführt und beinhalten u. a. Orientierungshilfen und Balance zwischen Reizüberflutung und -deprivation. Gute Kenntnis der Symptomatologie ist entscheidend auch im Hinblick auf die Prävention (Delirfachschwester). Zur symptomatischen medikamentösen Behandlung erscheinen Neuroleptika günstig. Im Hinblick auf extrapyramidale Nebenwirkungen sind Typika den Atypika unterlegen. Der Einsatz von Cholinesterase-Inhibitoren kann aus der Literatur nicht belastbar gestützt werden. Zu Benzodiazepinen wird außer zur Behandlung von Entzugsdelirien eher nicht geraten. Präparate mit kurzer Halbwertszeit und fehlenden aktiven Metaboliten können jedoch kurzzeitig flankierend eingesetzt werden. Besonders wichtig erscheint die Prävention, zu der gute Kenntnisse der Risikofaktoren und ihres Managements beim behandelnden Personal von zentraler Bedeutung sind.

Dans les deux sexes, un tiers a deux tiers des patients environ presentent un ou plusieurs symptomes ou indices d’alteration de la vie sexuelle. Les troubles les plus importants, de beaucoup les plus frequents, sont inter-critiques. Dans la tres grande majorite des cas, il s’agit d’une baisse de l’activite sexuelle, qui peut affecter, isolement ou en association, le desir et l’interet sexuels, l’excitation ou l’orgasme. Ces troubles s’observent majoritairement dans les epilepsies partielles, particulierement les epilepsies temporales, mais peuvent concerner aussi les sujets presentant une epilepsie generalisee idiopathique. Les perturbations a l’origine de ces troubles sexuels sont multiples, psychologiques mais aussi physiologiques. L’etiologie de ces troubles, quasi certainement multifactorielle, reste imparfaitement elucidee. Les decharges et crises epileptiques, les lesions cerebrales, des troubles ou handicaps psychiques, intellectuels et sociaux, des modifications hormonales et neuro-endocriniennes, des effets collateraux des medicaments antiepileptiques, le traitement neuro-chirurgical de l’epilepsie sont autant de facteurs contributifs ou etiologiques dont certains sont fortement co-dependants. Les troubles sexuels en relation avec les crises sont beaucoup plus rares, qu’il s’agisse de crises comportant une semiologie de type sexuel ou d’exceptionnelles crises survenant en relation temporelle avec une activite sexuelle. En raison de la frequence des troubles sexuels intercritiques et de leur impact negatif notoire sur la qualite de vie, l’amelioration de leur depistage diagnostique et de leur prise en charge therapeutique est un objectif de soins tres important.",

This may occur when a myelopathy has yet to evolve fully, or is highly asymmetrical, as in Brown-Séquard syndrome. Other potential distractions include fluctuating symptoms, as may accompany spinal cord demyelination, and pseudoneuropathic features, as seen acutely in spinal shock and in the chronic setting with some high cervical cord lesions. A second pathology, such as a polyneuropathy or polyradiculopathy, can mask the presence of a myelopathy. The converse situation, of non-myelopathic disease mimicking a cord lesion, arises typically when symptoms and/or signs approximate bilateral symmetry. This may happen with certain diseases of the brain, or of the peripheral nerves, with functional disorders and even occasionally with non-neurological disease. These sources of diagnostic difficulty assume clinical importance when they delay the recognition of conditions that require urgent treatment.",

Since specific studies have yielded a relatively large numbers of cases in the past, it can be concluded that the disorder is probably more prevalent than is suggested in the literature. These cases may well be not only primary types, based on mental or unclear causes, but also secondary types, mediated by aberrant somatosensory sensations. Treatment of the underlying condition (in most cases a psychotic or mood disorder) has proved to be increasingly successful over time.Because of the possible co-occurrence of zoanthropy and alterations in coenesthesis, i.e. the sensation of physical existence, mental health workers should be on the lookout for cases of clinical zoanthropy in clinical practice and avoid treating them in the same way as they would treat other delusions. All cases that occur should be subjected to extra somatic investigations – including an EEG and neuroimaging – and treatment should be adjusted in accordance with the findings.",

MTE is a mostly acute condition, characterized by change of mentation (confusion, delirium, etc.) with little or no neurological deficit but with impressive diffuse EEG slowing. A variety of medical conditions lead to MTE, especially at an age above 50 years, but status-post-surgery (leaving aside cranial neurosurgery, but also cardiac surgery in view of common embolic cerebral pathology) may also result in MTE, especially with the use of general anesthesia. An attempt is made to analyze the plethora of contributory factors and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. All types of classical brain pathology such as strokes, meningitis-encephalitis and typical metabolic encephalopathies (hepatic, renal, etc.) and others must be excluded from the diagnosis of MTE. Special emphasis is being placed on behavioral and EEG criteria in the early state of impaired consciousness with subdivision into 4 types: obtundation, somnolence, morbid lethargy and delirium. Cases of MTE are best picked up by an interdepartmental consultation (liaison) service making use of neurological consultations and EEG assessment. The value of the latter cannot be overestimated in these cases, especially in view of the very limited contributions of neuroimaging methods. The prognosis tends to be good. Severe and fatal developments are usually due to intervening cerebral hypoxia or anoxia. In such a development, epileptic manifestations, which are usually absent or mild in MTE, can become quite prominent. A thorough multi-institutional and international study of MTE is already in the planning stage. It is hoped that preventive measures can minimize the cerebral complications.",

      "abstract": "Time for primary review 28 days.\n\nMore than any other organ of the body, brain integrity depends on the continuous blood supply of oxygen and glucose for covering the energy demands of the tissue. Cessation or severe reduction of blood flow results in almost instantaneous biochemical and functional deficits which become rapidly irreversible unless blood flow is promptly restored. The ischemia time that is tolerated by the brain depends, among others, on the density of ischemia, the tissue concentration of primary and secondary energy stores and the rate of energy consumption which, in turn, depends on the temperature, the degree of functional activity and the absence or presence of anesthetics and other drugs. There is also a major difference between the ischemic vulnerability of different regions of the brain. As an example, the CA1 sector of hippocampus may suffer irreversible injury after ischemia of as short as 5 min [94]whereas other nerve cell populations survive normothermic cerebrocirculatory arrest of as long as 1 h [77].\n\nThe pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia is further complicated by the fact that the severity of cell injury is modulated by numerous indirect or secondary consequences of the primary ischemic impact. Recirculation disturbances, stress responses, peroxidative changes, or the activation of genomic responses are only few examples of the large number of hemodynamic and molecular responses which determine the final outcome [153, 97]. The interpretation of experimental data of cerebral ischemia, therefore, requires intimate knowledge of the models and conditions under which the data have been collected. The number and diversity of such models, has become very large over the years because researchers have sought in vain for the ideal approach to study ischemic injury and its therapeutic reversal. Such an ideal model should be relevant to the clinical situation, it should be … \n\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +49 (221) 4726 211; Fax: +49 (221) 4726 325; E-mail: hossmann@mpin-koeln.mpg.de",

Chronic pain is the result of the complex interaction of biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors; it may be nociceptive, neuropathic, inflammatory, dysfunctional, or mixed. The diagnosis of LBP is based by excluding its specific cause and requires the assessment of a patient’s complaints, history data and somatic and neurologic examination. The administration of analgesics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and myorelaxants is the main direction of drug therapy for LBP. Cognitive and behavioral psychotherapy along with other methods is one of the effective directions for patients with chronic LBP.

      "abstract": "Psychiatric epidemiology constitutes an important subdiscipline of scientific psychiatry. Nevertheless, it still lags behind other branches of epidemiology. This has been attributed to the difficulties encountered in conceptualising and measuring mental disorders.1 It is only recently that the emphasis in the field has shifted from descriptive to analytical research and this is probably because of the influences from genetic epidemiology and social sciences.2 Psychiatric epidemiology has taken most of its tools from general epidemiology—that is, chronic disease epidemiology.3 It is therefore not surprising that no fundamental differences between the mother discipline and her psychiatric descendant exist. Yet, there are particular challenges in the conduct of psychiatric epidemiological research that are absent or less prominent in general, mostly somatically oriented, epidemiology.4 Challenges particularly encountered in psychiatric epidemiology include\n\n\n\n1. Assessment of caseness: psychiatric diagnoses are mostly made on the basis of symptoms—patients’ reports of their subjective experiences—and not signs, like fever in general medicine. Moreover, there are no pathognomonic symptoms or signs;\n\n2. Neither most mental disorders nor their best-known risk factors, like social deprivation, stress exposure, lack of social support, social isolation, abnormal personality traits or genetic liability, are as easily captured in a singular variable as tends to be the case in the epidemiology of somatic disease;\n\n3. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is costly in time and effort; and\n\n4. Information bias and non-response bias are more of a problem in psychiatric epidemiology than in other branches of epidemiology.\n\n\n\nIn our view, this warrants recognition of the epidemiology subspecialty “psychiatric epidemiology”.\n\nIn trying to cope with the above-mentioned challenges, psychiatric epidemiology has developed a set of concepts, albeit limited, and vocabulary of its own.

Possible organic lesions are contusions of brain, oedema, intracranial haematoma, fat embolism, or an open brain injury. On the other hand there may be no organic lesions, as for instance in concussion. In every case, the leading clinical symptom is alteration of consciousness. This arises through interference, at some point, with the reticulo-thalamocortical system which is responsible for the regulation of consciousness. Concurrently with the alteration of consciousness, the EEG also shows changes. At the same time, the EEG is affected by the other effects of trauma upon the brain. Becuase of this, this EEG is not exclusively determined by the degree of unconsciousness. The possible causes of traumatic unconsciousness, and of the pathological waves seen in such cases, cannot always be established in clinical medicine, and experimental studies particularly with regard to neurophysiology are required to explain them....",

      "abstract": "Short stature (SS) is defined as height less than the third percentile or below –2 standard deviation score (SDS) with reference to chronological age according to standard growth curves. Children are born small for gestational age (SGA) when their birth height and/or birth weight are below or equal to –2 SDS using standards such as Usher and McLean. In patients presenting with SS associated with abnormal physical features, malformations, or delayed development, a syndromic growth disorder should be considered. Whilst individually rare, there are many syndromes with short stature as a component—in the London Dysmorphology Database (Winter and Baraitser), there are 873 such syndromes, 175 of which are of prenatal onset. In these patients, malformations and/or sensorineural abnormalities should be systematically screened by complementary exams (skeletal X-rays, cardiac and abdominal ultrasound, complete eye and hearing evaluations). In some cases, these abnormalities could help in making the diagnosis (e.g. pulmonary stenosis suggestive of Noonan’s syndrome). Different chromosome disorders may present with SS. For this reason, chromosome studies, preferably high-resolution analysis, should be performed to search for chromosome abnormalities in these children. Specific gene analysis may be requested when a specific syndrome is suspected. In these syndromes, growth failure may be due to a wide variety of mechanisms, including growth hormone deficiency (GHD), growth hormone resistance (Laron syndrome, bone dysplasia) or in combination with nutritional issues with, in many, the underlying mechanisms still being unknown. A complete evaluation of growth hormone/IGF-1 axis is necessary in these children. There are many classifications of short stature, each with specific advantages and disadvantages. Indeed, syndromes with SS could be classified according to clinical presentation and in particular auxological and anthropometrical parameters (SS with normal prenatal growth, SS with intrauterine growth retardation, SS with obesity), or to pathophysiology (GHD or growth hormone insensitivity, bone disorders and idiopathic SS). Here, a classification based on clinical presentation is used. Those syndromes with SS that are most common and are often followed by paediatric endocrinologists namely Silver–Russell, Noonan’s, Turner’s and Prader–Willi syndromes will be reviewed, as well as some rarer syndromes.",

It provides support for the continued use of the brain death concept based on operational usefulness and its moral rightness in that it can provide good in the absence of harm and, for most, in the absence of offense to intuition or moral sense. Brain death is the irreversible cessation of whole-brain function, which would be followed by the cessation of cardiopulmonary function without the institution of artificial measures. Recognition of the vegetative state (VS) entails a clinical diagnosis. The VS is likely to be permanent 12 months after traumatic brain injury and 3 months after nontraumatic injury in children. Minimally conscious state (MCS) is considered by some to be a neurological state whose recognition allows special legal and moral consideration. The interpretation of \"minimal\" becomes \"hardly different from vegetative\".",

      "abstract": "Constipation is a common functional problem of the digestive system and may occur secondary to diet, drugs, endocrine diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, psychiatric disorders, or gastrointestinal obstruction. When there is no secondary cause, constipation is diagnosed as functional constipation. The first steps that should be taken to relieve symptoms are diet and lifestyle modifications, and if unsuccessful, laxative therapy should be initiated. If a patient does not respond to laxative therapy, diagnostic anorectal physiological tests are performed, though they are not routinely recommended. However, these tests may be considered earlier in patients strongly suspected to have a defecatory disorder. The revised guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation will undoubtedly aid the individualized management of chronic constipation in clinical practice.",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

A actigrafia emergiu como um metodo valioso para medir os padroes de sono e foi aplicada para avaliar o ritmo de descanso atividade na doenca de Alzheimer (DA). Uma comparacao direta entre pacientes com DA e Comprometimento Cognitivo leve (CCL), assim como com idosos normais, e escassa na literatura sobre padroes actigraficos. Metodos: Este estudo transversal incluiu 82 participantes ambulatoriais (27 idosos cognitivamente saudaveis, 28 pacientes CCL e 27 pacientes DA tardia com CCL). Sujeitos com estagio 2 ou 3 na Classificacao de Demencia Clinica (CDR), uso de medicamentos para disturbios do sono, diagnostico de outras doencas neurologicas (incluindo demencias nao relacionadas a DA), sintomas sugestivos de apneia obstrutiva do sono nao tratada ou sindrome das pernas inquietas e pontuacao maior que 5 na Escala de Depressao Geriatrica (GDS) foram excluidos. O estudo foi aprovado pelo Comite de Etica local e consistiu no uso ininterrupto de um aparelho de actigrafia de pulso por pelo menos 7 dias. Dados demograficos e clinicos foram coletados, incluindo os resultados da avaliacao cognitiva: Mini-mental, CDR, Escala de Avaliacao da DA - subescala cognitiva (ADAS-Cog), Teste de Fluencia Verbal (VFT), teste de desenho do relogio e GDS. Registros actigraficos relacionados ao ritmo desncanso atividade foram analisados por um programa adequado, considerando a variabilidade intradiaria media (mIV); estabilidade interdial (IS); media das 10 horas de maior atividade (M10); media das 5 horas de menor atividade (L5); amplitude relativa (AR). Resultados: Grupo DA apresentou maiores valores de L5 (media e desvio padrao: 114,7 ± 124,7 vs. 57,1 ± 48,7; p = 0,011) e tendencia a maior mIV (0,73 ± 0,15 vs. 0,64 ± 0,15; p = 0,055) do que o CCL pacientes. Por outro lado, os valores de AR foram menores em pacientes com DA (0,94 ± 0,04 vs. 0,97 ± 0,02; p = 0,011). Individuos normais mostraram uma tendencia a diminuir os valores de L5 em comparacao ao grupo DA (79,7 ± 50,5 vs. 114,7 ± 124,7; p = 0,067). Como esperado, o grupo com DA apresentou pior desempenho em todos os testes cognitivos em comparacao aos demais (Minimental 18,2 ± 4,8 vs. 24,7 ± 2,5 [CCL] e 27,6 ± 2,4 [normal]; VFT 9,4 ± 3,0 vs. 15,7 ± 5,0 [CCL] e vs. 19,3 ± 5,1 [normal], ADAS-Cog 23,2 ± 10,2 vs. 10,0 ± 2,7 [CCL] e vs. 5,6 ± 2,3 [normal]; p <0,001 para todas as comparacoes). Os pacientes com CCL tambem eram cognitivamente piores que os individuos cognitivamente normais (Minimental 24,7 ± 2,5 vs. 27,6 ± 2,4 [p = 0,001]; VFT 15,7 ± 5,0 vs. 19,3 ± 5,1 [p = 0,010]; ADAS-Cog 10,0 ± 2,7 vs 5,6 ± 2,3 [p = 0,032]).

Los efectos del deterioro de estas funciones traen como consecuencia la perdida de la capacidad para cuidar de uno mismo y de programar y llevar a cabo las actividades de forma progresiva. La demencia Alzheimer es la mas comun y sobre la que mas estudios se han realizado, pero tambien hay otros tipos como la demencia vascular, demencia frontotemporal y la demencia de cuerpos de Lewy. En el mundo hay unos 47,5 millones de personas con demencia y cada ano se registran 7,7 millones de nuevos casos. Existe evidencia que demuestra el problema de desnutricion que padecen muchas de las personas con demencia. Sus problemas de alimentacion son derivados del deterioro de las habilidades motoras y cognitivas antes mencionadas: se les olvida comer, no reconocen los alimentos, sufren disfagia... Una de las opciones para hacer frente a la desnutricion en estos pacientes consiste en iniciar una alimentacion enteral por sonda nasograstrica (SN) o gastrostomia endoscopica percutanea (PEG), especialmente en casos graves; pero su utilizacion es controvertida y presenta muchas cuestiones eticas. Cuando la alimentacion por sonda esta contraindicada o es inapropiada se deben encontrar estrategias para fomentar la ingesta de alimentos. Se han sugerido muchos consejos para las etapas tempranas de la demencia pero la evidencia en la que se basan no esta clara. (2)",

It affects around 1% of the population over 65 years of age and has a prevalence of 4% or more among individuals over the age of 85 years [1]. The condition is primarily the result of a progressive, chronic loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum and presents with or without intracytoplasmic Lewy body deposits [1-3]. A monogenic etiology is found in only around 5% of cases. In cases that do not have a monogenic etiology, the condition is known as sporadic or idiopathic PD and occurs as a result of interaction between a series of hereditary and environmental factors [3].",

      "title": "Deep brain stimulation for trauma: Patient selection and evaluation",
      "abstract": "The selection of patients with movement disorders for deep brain stimulation is becoming a common neurological and neurosurgical task. Deep brain stimulation is suitable for different forms of tremor, which can often not be treated with medication. This suitability applies for essential tremor, monosymptomatic tremor at rest, cerebellar or multiple sclerosis tremor, Holmes' tremor, primary writing tremor or tremor in neuropathies. The appropriate selection of patients is critical for the outcome of surgical relief of tremors. Considering the risks of any stereotactic intervention, the following must apply: (1) motor symptoms lead to a relevant disability in activities of daily living, despite optimal medical treatment; (2) biological age of the patient; (3) neurosurgical contraindications; (4) the patient is neither demented nor severely depressed. If these conditions are fulfilled, the individual chances of improvement of the target symptoms need to be checked, based on the following guidelines: (1) the kind of tremor, (2) the natural course of the tremor, (3) the chances for medical treatment in a particular patient, (4) the outcome of surgery in a specific condition, (5) the individual risks for a patient to suffer from complications. The outcome of surgery for tremor depends on the clinical type and distribution. Distal limb tremors are easier to treat than proximal limb tremors. Intention tremor is more difficult to treat than rest or postural tremor. The indication for surgical treatment depends on the analysis of the individual risk–benefit ratio, which also has to take into account the patients' social, professional, and familial background. The patient needs to be well informed about his individual risk–benefit ratio and of alternative treatments, before undergoing stereotactic surgery. © 2002 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Neurological immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with cancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) present diverse clinical characteristics. Neurological irAEs affect the peripheral nervous system and muscles more than they affect the central nervous system. Among the various subsets of peripheral neuropathies, polyradiculoneuropathy, which includes Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, stands out as the most severe form, leading to significant muscle weakness. ICIs can induce dysautonomia, including autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. Autonomic neuropathy represents a neurological irAE. Neurological irAEs of neuromuscular junctions include myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Diagnosing MG or myositis independently can be challenging when they occur as irAEs. Myocarditis is sometimes observed as an irAE in patients with MG and can cause both severe heart failure and lethal arrhythmias, resulting in fatal outcomes. Anti-Kv1.4 antibodies are biomarkers of the severe form of MG and myocarditis. The administration of ICI in patients with small cell lung cancer increases the risk of LEMS. The distinction between LEMS is an irAE or a manifestation of paraneoplastic neurological syndrome is unclear as both conditions share common immunological mechanisms.",

Une des raisons est probablement la confusion sur ce qui peut être attribué à l’âge ou aux effets de l’alcool. De plus, ces derniers imitent certains symptômes d’autres maladies et troubles, par exemple les troubles anxieux, la dépression ou la démence. La plupart des outils de dépistage sont insuffisamment adaptés aux personnes âgées et l’estimation de l’abus d’alcool chez celles-ci varie largement selon les méthodes utilisées. La vieillesse devient également un facteur de fragilisation face à la consommation d’alcool surtout si la personne âgée présente des problèmes de santé. Les alcoolisations sont souvent une réponse à la solitude, à l’isolement ou à la perte de soutien social et à l’anxiété, à la dépression et au stress. L’efficacité des interventions brèves dans le cas d’abus d’alcool chez les adultes âgés a été soulignée par ses résultats.

Le présent rapport soutient l’hypothèse que les symptômes de bruxisme associés à des maladies neurocognitives sont la conséquence directe d’une perturbation de l’équilibre des neurotransmetteurs. Les interactions provoquées par les neurotransmetteurs sont très complexes en raison de leurs effets inhibiteurs et activateurs.

Tijek i ishod bolesti je nepredvidiv i razlikuje se od osobe do osobe, a informacije o obliku MS-a pomoci ce o određivanju prognoze i provedbi kvalitetnog i uspjesnog lijecenja. Postoji nekoliko vrsta lijecenja za oboljele, ali niti jedan ne omogucava potpuno izljecenje vec samo usporavanje progresa bolesti i smanjenje simptoma. Vrlo je važno usmjeriti se na pojedinca od samog procesa dijagnosticiranja preko procesa lijecenja i rehabilitacije te pracenja daljnjeg tijeka bolesti. Medicinska sestra jedna je od osoba koje se brinu o oboljelima od multiple skleroze i ima važnu ulogu u provedbi sestrinskih intervencija s takvim pacijentom. Ova je dijagnoza problem danasnjice i javnozdravstveni problem jer je broj oboljelih sve veci, a dobna granica oboljelih je sve niža.",

The implications of this particular pattern of cognitive alterations for theories concerning the etiology of anorexia nervosa are discussed.",

      "title": "Depression gets old fast: do stress and depression accelerate cell aging?",
      "abstract": "Depression has been likened to a state of \"accelerated aging,\" and depressed individuals have a higher incidence of various diseases of aging, such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and dementia. Chronic exposure to certain interlinked biochemical pathways that mediate stress-related depression may contribute to \"accelerated aging,\" cell damage, and certain comorbid medical illnesses. Biochemical mediators explored in this theoretical review include the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (e.g., hyper- or hypoactivation of glucocorticoid receptors), neurosteroids, such as dehydroepiandrosterone and allopregnanolone, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, excitotoxicity, oxidative and inflammatory stress, and disturbances of the telomere/telomerase maintenance system. A better appreciation of the role of these mediators in depressive illness could lead to refined models of depression, to a re-conceptualization of depression as a whole body disease rather than just a \"mental illness,\" and to the rational development of new classes of medications to treat depression and its related medical comorbidities.

      "abstract": "The concept ``psychosomatic'', initially introduced in the first half of this century, has recently being reconfirmed by the theory and practice of modern medicine. The psychosomatic disorders are generally defined as physical (somatic) diseases produced, in part, by psychological factors, primarily stress. The organs of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and endocrine system are being affected, as a result of innervation by the autonomic nervous system. In some of these diseases the psychological factors can play relatively essential role; these are named ``primary psychosomatic diseases'': essential hypertension, peptic ulcer, bronchial asthma, ulcerative colitis, neurodermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and hyperthyroidism (the last two diseases were later replaced by eating disorders as bulimia and anorexia nervosa). In many other cases the psychological element is only one among several parallel factors; these are sometimes called ``secondary psychosomatic diseases''. As known from the psychosomatic medicine, the stressors are being refracted through the individual history of a person as through a prism, leading to a spectrum of possible reactions. The personality prism comprises heredity, early child experiences and actual conflict, while the resulting disorders, as a response of the human being, have the form of neuroses, disturbed behavior and psychoses from one side, and psychophysiological disorders and othermore » psychosomatic diseases, including synergetic amplification, from the other side. The probability of each outcome depends primarily on the individual personality prism, as well as on the characteristics of the stressors.« less",

      "title": "Leitlinie zur Beurteilung der Fahreignung bei neurologischen Erkrankungen",
      "abstract": "Anlass für eine Beurteilung der Fahreignung (FE) ist entweder die Selbstprüfungspflicht des Patienten, die Aufklärungspflicht des Arztes oder die Anforderung eines Gutachtens durch die Fahrerlaubnisbehörden. Zu beurteilen sind die körperlichen Voraussetzungen, nämlich die Gebrauchsfähigkeit von Armen und Beinen, das Sehvermögen und das Gleichgewicht sowie geistige (psychische) Voraussetzungen, nämlich die (visuelle) Wahrnehmungsfähigkeit, die Aufmerksamkeit und die Belastbarkeit. Zu deren Überprüfung werden in der Regel geeignete, objektivierbare psychologische Testverfahren verlangt. Festgestellte Eignungsmängel können unter Umständen durch entsprechende Hilfsmittel, Kfz-Umbauten oder durch eine besonders erfahrene, vorausschauende und sicherheitsbewusste Fahrweise kompensiert werden. Nicht kompensiert werden können homonyme Hemianopsie, persistierende Doppelbilder bei Geradeausblick, unvorhersehbar attackenförmig auftretender Schwindel, visuelles Hemineglektsyndrom sowie charakterliche Mängel. In der Beurteilung bei speziellen Krankheitsbildern ist immer vom Einzelfall auszugehen. Von einer Einschränkung der FE ist auszugehen, wenn eine Verkehrsgefährdung durch die Erkrankung/Symptomatik in konkreten Fahrsituationen anzunehmen ist, sodass ein Unfall mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit eintreten kann. Derartige Gefährdungssituationen entstehen durch Einschränkungen der körperlichen oder geistigen Leistungsfähigkeit, unvorhersehbar auftretende Störungen der Leistungsfähigkeit oder mangelnde Einsicht in Gefahren und Risiken. Die Bedingungen bei verschiedenen Krankheitsbildern/Syndromen werden diskutiert. Für das praktische Vorgehen werden neben der aktuellen klinischen Untersuchung ggf. ein EEG, Doppler-Sonographie der hirnversorgenden Gefäße und eine neuropsychologische Untersuchung empfohlen.",

Specifically, major depressive\ndisorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more\ndepressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or\npleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia\nor hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of\nworthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts\nof death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom\nseverity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same twoweek period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of\nfunctioning.",

      "abstract": "Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) almost always experience effects in the visual pathway; and thus, visual dysfunction is not only common but also highly relevant. The visual pathway represents a model of acute focal central nervous system (CNS) damage, through acute optic neuritis and retinal periphlebitis, as well as a model of chronic, diffuse CNS damage through chronic retinopathy and optic neuropathy. The optic pathway can be accurately evaluated in detail, due to the availability of highly sensitive imaging techniques (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging or optical coherent tomography) or electrophysiological tests (multifocal visual evoked potentials or electroretinography). These techniques allow the interactions between the different processes at play to be evaluated, such as inflammation, demyelination, axonal damage and neurodegeneration. Moreover, these features mean that the visual pathway can be used as a model to test new neuroprotective or regenerative therapies.",
